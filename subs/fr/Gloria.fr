Excuse me.
Look, I don't want any trouble from you.
It's Jeri.
What happened?
I don't want to talk in front of the kids.
What's the matter, Mom?
Nothing's the matter.
She just got the groceries.
Are the bags packed?
You got the money from the bank?
Don't talk money in front of the kids.
- You got the tickets? - No more questions.
Where are we going?
Listen, Phil is very upset that we're leaving.
That kid is so sensitive.
I'm gonna cook dinner, okay?
No, you're not going to cook dinner.
There's no time for that now.
Then why did I go shopping?
What the hell am I supposed to be doing?
Son of a bitch packages....
The bus, I had to wait in the bad line and then the bag slipped, everything comes out.
Fuck. Son of a bitch!
Did you see anybody downstairs?
A man.
What kind of man?
A man with a shirt.
What kind of shirt?
A shirt. With shoes.
601.
He's up there.
His wife just went up the elevator.
Nice staircase they got here.
What took you so long?
I got lost.
I went over the 138th Street Bridge then back over the 155th Street Bridge made a wrong turn past Yankee Stadium the heat, traffic, people.
All right, you're here, now let's go.
Hold this.
Hold this. Be careful. Don't blow yourself up.
Where did you go?
I went to stop downtown, at 44th Street.
They're checking on his accounts.
He's skimming off the top.
How much?
$600,000, give or take $3,000.
That's only in seven accounts.
- How do they know?
- I mentioned I don't run with the babes.
I carry pictures of the kids in my wallet.
Never mind dinner. Pack your things.
- We've been packed for two days.
- Get your things.
We haven't finished yet, can't you see.... ¿Qué quieres que lleve?
All right, leave the junk, just take the clothes.
What clothes?
I think the kids should eat something. It's almost ready.
Don't argue with me, Ma.
We don't know who's coming here.
Jack told them about the kids.
He's got pictures in his wallet, he talks about us.
Okay. Let's get the bags.
Come on.
Are you sure you're sure?
- I know how sure I am.
- But not to kids.
Listen, Tommy didn't have any kids, he was a bachelor. Jesus Christ!
You did something.
What's the matter with you? Listen to me.
I didn't do anything.
- I only made a remark. - When?
I don't know. A couple of weeks ago.
- That's why you couldn't sleep?
- Yeah, that's why.
- Do you think they heard you?
- What do you mean? I said it out loud.
What did you say?
Listen, they asked me a question I said I had it written down.
- I tried to get them not to believe me.
- You told them you had the book?
Ma, get the kids ready.
We're going.
Ma, please, where are we going?
I want to know right now.
When I say we're leaving, we're leaving right now.
Move!
What am I supposed to do with this? What the hell is this for?
I'm not going to answer. I'm not getting my eye blown off.
Do you need help? What's wrong, Dad?
You shut up, you stupid.
You're the one that got us into all of this.
It's Gloria.
Hi.
Ran out of coffee.
Come in out of the hall, hurry.
What are you doing with that gun?
What's going on here?
I think I came at a bad time.
Yeah, you came at a bad time.
You came at a terrible time.
There are men downstairs.
We have every reason to believe that Jack's marked and I'm marked.
Joanie and Phil are marked.
And Margarita's marked.
You gotta take the kids, Gloria.
Jeri, you know I'd do anything for you, but I don't like kids.
I hate kids. Especially yours.
You mind not talking about my kids that way?
Just shut up.
She's my friend.
She don't know how serious it is, all right?
Jack's an accountant for the Mob.
He finked to the FBI.
He's been skimming off the top and now the kids are marked.
Okay.
I think it's a good idea, Jack.
There's a gangster in the lobby. They're right here in the building.
- I think we ought to call the police.
- Ma, just shut up, all right?
Okay, pal.
Okay, you want to come with me?
- I'm not going.
- Joan!
Stay there.
Joanie, let go of that bedpost. I'm your mother and what I say goes.
No, Ma, no!
- Joan, open this door. - Come out of that bathroom.
Give me the book.
Listen to me. This book will save your life.
It's the bible.
It's everything I know, about everything in the world, understand?
It's your future.
Okay?
Go on.
Now listen to me, be a man.
Always be tough.
Don't trust anybody.
Understand?
I love you.
Will you be safe?
Go, now.
Come on, kid.
Go!
Go with her, now! Go on!
I don't know what to do.
Your father told you to come with me.
So, come on.
Come on.
I got some goldfish in the bedroom. You want to play with them?
You want to play 20 questions?
How about watching TV for a while?
- Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes.
Where's my boy?
Come on big fella, come on.
There's my baby.
Do you like him?
Do you like cats?
Phil, he wants to talk to you.
Yes, Poppy, you want me to come home?
Is my sister still there?
I love you, too.
You're the man.
Phil, you're the head of the family.
Remember that?
Will you remember that?
Let me speak to her.
Let me speak to her.
He wants to speak to you, but I want to speak to him.
Yes, Jack, I understand now.
Hello, Poppy, this is Phil.
What's going on?
Where's Mom?
I want to speak to you.
My sister.
I want my father.
Poppy.
I want my father! Poppy!
I hate you, you stupid person.
You're a pig.
Think of it.... It's like a dream, you know?
How when you go to sleep sometimes and you get killed in a nightmare or something.
You always wake up again knowing you're somebody else, right?
How old are you? 6?
I don't know what to do with you, kid.
My poor cat.
What do I do with you?
You're not my family, or anything.
You're just a neighbor's kid, right?
Am I right?
You better get out of here, the police--
All right, come on.
Let's go.
- Let's get out of here. Let's go. - I'm walking.
Who knows who's on the gimme, right?
I don't know.
If I'm gonna get you out of here, I gotta have your help.
How can I help you?
They're going to kill us, you little jackass.
I don't want to die.
I saved all my life so I could have some money.
And I got it.
You're too young to know what making a living is, but.... ...I got my money, I got my apartment, I got my friends, my cat.
I don't want my face to look like hamburger.
Shoes pictures perfume.
I'm going home now.
No, you're not going home.
I have to.
What are you going to find in there, dead bodies?
This is your father's book.
Don't let anything happen to it.
Let me go!
Poppy!
Okay, listen. This is a dream.
I told you before, it's all a dream.
Nothing bad has really happened.
Now we gotta get out of here.
You're gonna walk.
Okay, take a step.
Come on, kid, that's it, let's go.
Now take another step.
That's good.
Great.
Lady, get that kid out of here.
Hold it. That officer said to get this kid out of here.
Stay right here.
All right, I'll let you know when you can go out.
All right, go ahead, take the kid and go outside.
Go ahead.
Get that camera out of here.
Let me have my kid.
Let her go.
Come on, break it up, come on.
What a slob.
Hey, sister.
I want my father.
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right, kid. It's just a dream.
That's all it is.
Go on back to sleep.
They're checking us out.
Who's "they"?
I don't know. I don't know who "they" is.
Thanks, Gloria.
Is that all you want?
I'm going to go in the bathroom now.
Don't answer that telephone.
And don't go near the windows.
Or the door.
If you hear anything just come on in the bathroom and get me. Knock on the door.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Go to the toilet.
Who would want to kill a low-income family of four in the Bronx with shotguns?
Who would want to kidnap their 6-year-old boy?
The family is named Dawn, they're dead. The possible abductor's name is Gloria Swenson, patterned after Gloria Swanson.
It wasn't a robbery, it was a Mob murder.
I'm not going with you.
I got no time to play games with you, kid.
I am the man.
Do you hear me?
I am the man. I am the man.
Not you.
You're not the man.
I am the man.
I'll do anything I can. I am the man!
Come on, let me see.
Come on.
Come on, kid.
You are not the man.
You don't listen, you don't know anything.
You're driving me crazy.
Let me have the keys.
It's me, Gloria.
- Did you see her? - No.
Harry, did you see her?
Where did you see her at?
I didn't see nothing.
There they are. They're down there.
How in the hell did that happen?
I didn't pass anybody.
Come out, honey.
Come here, sweetheart. Come on, Gloria.
Nobody passed me on the street.
Get away from that door!
Let go of me, will you?
Stop hanging on me.
Kid, listen.
The guys that killed your family they're friends of mine.
Do you understand?
Do you?
My feet are falling off.
I can't run any more.
What am I doing here?
I don't want to get killed.
That's it!
Look, you....
Come on, you start running.
Come on, you run.
Go on.
Run, go on, run on home, go on!
Did you hear me?
Look, I'm not going with you. I can't.
I'm overweight, I'm out of shape.
Look, go back to your house.
We're not so far away, go on!
You've got relatives and friends. Let them take care of you.
Go on!
I'm not taking care of you anymore.
I can't.
I can't even turn you over to the cops.
Don't you understand?
I've been in jail. You understand jail?
The people that killed your parents, they're my friends.
I can't get involved with you.
Go on now, run.
We're not interested in you.
All we want is the book and the kid.
Do you understand?
Sure.
Gloria, why don't you take a walk?
Look, we'll take care of that kid.
You got that book, kid?
Come here.
Frank what are you gonna do?
Shoot a 6-year-old Puerto Rican kid on the street?
He don't know nothing.
He don't even speak English.
What happened over there?
That's some accident.
Yeah, we're not interested in accidents.
86th and Lexington.
You deaf?
Gloria, I'm sorry.
Listen to me.
It was all my fault.
You did it for me.
Leave it alone, will you?
Just do me a favor and don't talk anymore.
Forget about it.
What the hell.
We'll go up to my bank and take out my money and we'll buy some new clothes, okay?
Here, keep it.
You know what desperate is?
Stay there.
Wait.
I'd like to get all my money out of the bank.
Checking or savings?
It's in a safe deposit box.
- You have to see an assistant manager.
- Goodbye.
I'd like to get into my safe deposit box.
How are you?
How am I?
I think I've helped you before, haven't I?
Oh, yeah.
Your key, please.
- What's your name? - Ron.
I'd like to be alone with my money.
Stay there, I'll be right back.
You're out of your mind.
The word's around you've been doing a lot of shooting.
Hurt some good people.
You've been interfering with business.
In their opinion, you should know better.
That's the word that's around.
- His mother was a friend of mine. - So what?
You got to be out of your mind.
- Who was that?
- My uncle.
Come on.
Here you are, keep the change.
That's $5.
I'm getting out on this side, so don't give me any argument.
Yes, miss?
I'm with a kid.
I realize that, but we haven't any space.
We don't want space, we want a room.
Do you have a reservation?
I'm sorry, there isn't any room.
Let's get out of here now!
Fuck!
He don't know the score.
He sees a dame like you and a guy like me.... He don't know.
Yeah.
We'd be better off in a dumpier part of town.
- Okay, here are your socks. Put them on.
- No.
I feel like your mother.
You aren't my mother.
What did you say?
You aren't my mother.
My mother's beautiful.
This is our stop.
Let's get off.
- Hello. - Hello.
I'm a friend of Louie Saul.
He's out of town.
- I need a room.
- $2.50 a night.
But it's a flophouse.
- You want it in advance or you trust me?
- $2.50.
You got it?
- Where's the key?
- It's open.
- What room number?
- Any room you want. They're all open.
You make a great target standing in that window.
Gloria, are you awake?
What's the matter now?
These neon lights are driving me crazy.
Go to sleep.
We gotta get out of here in the morning.
Blinking lights. Do they remind you of anything?
May I touch yours?
May you touch my what?
Your hair.
You like me?
How could I resist you?
A body like yours, it's a pleasure to lie in bed with you.
Do you love me?
- No, I don't even know you.
- Do you think?
What is that supposed to mean?
I don't know. When you get older, you get tougher.
But you won't have to be scared.
Because every time there's noise you have to be scared.
I'm not scared.
Not even of nightmares?
No, nothing.
- No dreams at all? - No.
What do you do, just close your eyes and black?
What is this getting to be?
You trying to embarrass me, or what?
No, I'm trying to tell you something.
I'm trying to.
What?
Have you ever been in love?
Forget it.
I outweigh you 60 pounds.
So leave me alone.
What's the matter now?
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry I kept you awake last night.
Your father's book is very interesting. I think we ought to burn it.
No!
You're so stupid sometimes.
Okay, it's your book.
I know it's my book.
So what are we going to do?
We're gonna try to get to Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh?
For how long?
Is it far away?
Yeah. First we're gonna stop at a cemetery.
I think you ought to say a little prayer.
Do I have to?
I said so, didn't I?
You got change for $100?
I could get it.
Take this and come back.
We'll be 15 minutes, and then we want to go back into the city.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm glad I'm with you.
Okay, let's find a tombstone.
What town is this?
What difference does it make?
I don't understand.
I don't know what to do.
What, am I going to see them?
No, they're not buried here.
We're going to pretend.
All dead people stick together anyway.
It doesn't make any difference.
I don't think I should do this.
I mean I don't mind.
I don't mind a lot of things but this is a little gruesome.
You always got to say goodbye.
Dead people are.... It's like....
What's it like?
Like a ship.
Did you ever see a ship sail?
It's like those dreams we were talking about.
Here, these are nice.
Any of these.
Those are nice stones.
Now go on up there and you kneel down and you know, just say whatever comes into your heart.
Where are you going to be?
I'm going to be right here.
Hello.
How are you?
I miss you.
But then you know how I feel.
I had a dream about you the other night and.... Amen.
Nobody knows where I am.
What do you mean?
I have friends.
You know.
I want to go home.
Don't be stupid.
You got no home.
You got me.
I want to play stickball.
I want to go to school.
Phil.
I want to go home, Gloria.
Think of something funny.
I can't.
You?
You can't think of something funny?
Anybody says anything funny to you you practically split your blood vessels laughing.
Okay. Here, keep the change.
My book!
Okay, get it.
My father's book.
Come on.
I don't want to go to Pittsburgh.
- I'm sorry, Gloria, and I'm tired.
- So what?
Excuse me. Which track for Pittsburgh?
- Miss, why don't you go to information?
- Thanks.
- My friend and I would like a table.
- This way, please.
Will this do?
- If it's the best you got.
Relax.
I don't know what's going on.
Nothing's going right.
Can I have a piece of pie?
What kind of pie?
Apple with vanilla ice cream.
We don't have apple.
- Then what do you have?
Okay. I'll have peach with vanilla ice cream.
What to drink?
- I'll have a Coke.
- He'll have milk.
I don't want milk.
He'll have milk and I'll have a cup of coffee.
Black or regular?
- Milk and sugar on the side. - Milk and sugar on the side.
Take a walk.
What's funny? My nose?
No.
You're so tough.
I'm tough?
I don't mean "tough."
So strong.
- You know.
- Yeah, I know.
If you wanted to split up, it's okay with me.
Just don't be phony.
I hate that.
We'll split up.
What's that supposed to be, a threat?
You can't even carry my bag. You can't even speak English. You can't even remember that book.
You can't even speak English.
And you don't know enough to apologize when you're wrong.
You don't listen.
And you're rude.
- I'm rude?
- That's right.
That's a laugh.
What happened to my pie?
And my vanilla ice cream?
You want it?
Take a walk.
Give me the book.
Hand it to me.
Give it to me and shut up!
Now here's the book.
Here's what you've been looking for.
I'm Gloria.
I've got my hand on a gun.
I want to make a deal.
You want to make a deal?
I can't make that decision.
Why not?
Because I don't trust these guys and I'm not Mr. Tanzini.
Okay, you want it?
Tanzini, huh?
You want it?
Okay, guys.
This is your option.
I got a 6-year-old kid over there, doesn't know his ass is up.
Had his whole family murdered by you punks.
Empty them in that.
Do it!
In the bag.
In the purse.
What's the matter?
What are they gonna do?
All right, pick the pieces up.
Let's wait outside.
They'll wait for us outside.
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.
There's a back way out.
Just sit there until I think of something.
Run!
I'll lead the way.
Don't worry about it.
- This way.
- No, come on, this way.
Get over here! This way! Get in there!
I'm telling you, it's this way.
Kill me!
Phil time to go.
What happened?
You have a pain?
Was that the car? Did it scare you?
I just realized I'm doing the wrong thing.
I should be sending you to boarding school.
Anyway, you're not Spanish like me.
You're not my mother, you're not my father, you're not anyone to me.
You're not enough for me.
Okay, Gloria?
So, I'm gonna find a family. Some new friends, and a girlfriend, too.
Okay. You're a nice girl, but you're not for me.
Fine.
See that bar across the street?
I'm going to be in there, having a drink.
You want to join me, fine.
If you don't, you want to run away that's your problem.
'Bye, chiquita. 'Bye, little sucker.
'Bye, little insect. 'Bye, little fly.
'Bye, little tiny insect.
'Bye, sucker.
Wake up, that's all for you, Beanie.
I don't want any headaches.
- Can I help you, miss? - Yeah.
Give me a beer.
Any particular kind?
Cold.
- Nice and cold. - Thank you.
You got the time?
8:30.
You open early.
Every morning. 8:00 a.m.
Bartender, I can't look, for whatever reason, I can't tell you what it is, but.... Look over there.
Is there a kid coming in this way or standing across the street?
Forget it.
I'm leaving that for luck.
Have a nice day.
Okay, just keep going down Broadway.
Nice and slow.
I'm looking for somebody, okay?
Take a left up here.
There are a lot of Puerto Ricans in New York.
I don't imagine there are too many 6-year-old Puerto Ricans though.
Is your name Crubbs?
Come on. Your father home?
- Just give us the money. Get your hands off me, kid.
Beat it!
Whatever we do, we do together.
We're not interested in that, kid.
Al, do me a favor.
Take a walk. He's okay now.
Go to your room. Take your kid out of here.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Who do you think it is?
Are you mad at me?
Mad at you?
No. Frank, are we mad at him?
I don't get mad at kids.
You're stupid.
You did the same thing to his father as they did to mine.
Had to shoot me with a Magnum.
Okay, you bananas, inside.
Move it!
Phil, right here, next to me.
Get going, suckers.
There are women and kids here.
- Don't be stupid, will you?
- Hold it. There are women and kids here.
Move!
Freeze!
Get out here, kid.
Dames in the bedroom.
That's it.
I want the sissy out here, up against the wall.
Right here.
Don't do it, fella, unless you're sick of your friend here.
Okay.
I'm reaching.
Coming up.
Okay, inside, punk.
Are you with that dame? Because I'll kill you.
Okay, back in the bedroom.
You, out here.
Come on.
Let me see that purse.
Back in the bedroom.
Okay, wise guy, your turn.
Okay, give me your piece.
Give me your piece.
That's it.
Okay, back in the toilet.
Okay, everybody in the bathroom.
Everybody in the bathroom. Everybody.
Shut the door.
In 20 seconds I'm going to start shooting through that door. High, jerks, so get down on your stomachs.
Gloria, what are you doing?
I'm saving your life, stupid.
Now pick up those guns.
Move it!
Move!
You double-crossing little rat!
Come on, in the cab down there at the end of the street.
Come on.
Come on. I'd love it.
Come on.
Don't hang back, I'd love it.
Love it.
Get in that cab.
Don't lose her.
Think they're gonna scare us, did they?
You know, it's not pleasant killing a woman.
Hey, fellas, here.
You, give me your hand.
I know I'm a lot of trouble.
No, you're no trouble.
I mean, I walk into a roomful of hoods. A guy pulls a gun on me and you side with him.
You shot my friend's father.
I'll kill anybody that's trying to kill me.
You're right.
Then you wouldn't take the gun, then you didn't want to leave.
So where's your loyalty?
Where's my what?
I can't anymore in this local.
Come on, let's get the express.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Did I tell you to come on?
Get over here.
Get off at 42nd Street.
42nd Street.
What?
Go ahead, try me.
You'll love it. Okay?
Sissies.
You let a woman beat you, huh?
You little tiny nothings.
You punk!
Go ahead, punk!
I want two tickets to....
Excuse me.
When's the next train to Harrisburg?
This place is making me nervous.
Let's go to a hotel and get a night's sleep.
Okay.
- You hungry, kid?
- No. I'm just tired.
Yeah, me too, kid.
Boy, they got everything covered.
Trains, planes.
I don't know.
Maybe Pittsburgh's connected, too.
Who knows?
They gotta have gangsters in Pittsburgh, too.
They don't.
Here it is.
Don't be scared.
I got my gun.
It's nothing for me to blow someone's brains out, believe me.
I just hope it's someone I know.
I'm with you, Gloria.
Get in the bathroom.
Get in there!
- Who is it?
- It's me, bellman.
We have our bags.
I have some flowers.
Compliments of the house.
You want me to put these in water for you?
Everything all right?
- Everything is not all right.
- What's wrong?
Thank you.
Take a load off your feet.
Gloria, you won't believe this, but I'm growing up fast.
The first time I met you, I didn't know nothing.
I was ashamed to talk.
We can't go on like this.
What's the matter?
Unpack my clothes, will you?
And run a hot bath, I want to steam them.
You want to take a bath first?
You must stink by now.
No, I hate baths.
Don't worry, kid.
All this hopeless, stinking mess.
I asked you once if I could be your mother.
You didn't want that.
You want to be my mother?
You could be my mother.
I don't have any mother, no more mother.
So you could be my mother.
Why would you want to be my mother?
I don't know.
Just want to clear things up.
You're my mother.
You're my father.
You're my mother.
You're my whole family.
You're even my friend, Gloria.
You're my girlfriend, too.
Well, I'd like to be family.
You think they're gonna catch us, huh?
I don't know.
Probably.
You can't beat the system.
What's the system?
System?
I don't know.
Then how do you know you can't beat it?
Not too many people have.
Then have some people did?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
Hey, Gloria, we gotta try.
Even if we get shot.
You can't just keep on shooting everybody that goes knocking on your door.
Go to bed.
Sure.
We'll have a good night's sleep. Wake up tomorrow. You'll think of something.
- Want me to turn off the light?
- Yeah, turn off the light.
Aren't you coming to bed?
No, I'm going to take a bath.
You go to sleep.
I only have a $100 bill.
Forget it.
Forget it?
Take the donuts, take everything.
Okay.
Thanks.
Sill, how are you?
Long time.
- What's up?
- What's up with you, baby?
Just leaving.
Move over.
Where to?
Go down two blocks, take a left.
Go another block and take a left again.
That's a one-way, lady.
Then go one more block.
You're looking good, Gloria.
Where you been?
Give me a break, Sill.
Come on, Gloria, give it up, will you? It's all over.
Hey, there's no place for you to go.
Look, I take you in now, it means a lot of money to me.
It could make me a big man.
Help!
Get your hands off me.
Take your hands off me, you fat bastard!
What the hell are you doing?
Why don't you turn around? You look like an ape.
Get out of my cab, mister.
Get out of the cab.
Now, take it easy, big fella.
What do I owe you?
I don't want your money.
Take a walk and don't get back in the cab.
And don't lean on the cab.
Don't lean on the cab.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
I gotta make a phone call.
Operator, I'd like to call 477-9970.
Yes, I hear it's busy.
Don't call me back.
I'll call you in a couple of seconds, okay?
So, who are you calling?
Phil, listen to me now.
I'm going to call Tanzini.
Who is that?
Give me a chance, will you?
To be your partner.
I mean, what am I for?
He's an old friend.
He's a Mob guy.
We used to live together.
He was your boyfriend?
Let me call this guy. Okay?
Operator, I'd like to try that 477-9970 again, please.
- It's ringing.
- Do you trust this guy?
How are you?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Never mind where I am.
Can you help me?
Don't tell me, "It depends." I don't want to hear, "It depends."
I'm going to bring the book, Tony.
I'm fine.
How are you?
You got fat?
Yeah, I love you, too.
I don't want to say when.
But soon.
What happens if he doesn't help you?
I gotta take the book, Phil.
What happens if he double-crosses you?
He won't.
I know him.
What happens if he kills you?
Look, I'd better give you some money.
I only got $100s.
I tried to get some change this morning, but I couldn't.
Now take this $100. You get change. Take the rest of these and you stuff them down inside your socks.
Don't tell anybody you got them.
You're a kid and they'll steal them from you.
You wait here three hours.
If I'm not back by then, beat it.
You'll be back, won't you?
Yeah.
I'll be back. Bank on it.
Three hours.
Maybe I should wait three and a half?
Okay, three and a half, but no more.
If I'm not back in three and a half hours, it doesn't mean I'm dead.
It means I'm gonna meet you in the train station in Pittsburgh.
You understand?
I love you, Gloria.
I love you to death.
Thanks.
Bolt it.
One, two, three four and a half.
One, two, three and a half.
What time do you have?
9:02, exactly.
To the button.
What time do you have now?
It's still 9:20.
- I hope you got change for $100. - You're kidding.
Forget it.
Just wait for me.
Tony's expecting me.
Got a million bucks in this slow elevator.
Mr. T Gloria's on the way up.
Come in, please.
Excuse me, could you wait, please?
It doesn't matter to me.
Any way you want to do it.
It's up to him.
Excuse me, she's here.
I don't want to see her now.
Let her wait.
She has the book.
Put her inside.
She can wait.
We don't want to be disturbed.
Please.
- Would you like coffee? - No.
- Who? - Harvey.
- Everything all right?
Excuse me.
Where is the child?
Gloria, you are a smart girl.
You understand.
I like children.
I don't want to kill children.
Those weren't murders that we did.
You understand that?
Yes, I do.
The killings were made to set an example.
Where is the boy?
He's on a boat to South America.
Gloria, trust me.
Maybe we can do something.
Trust you?
Tony, I know you.
You know the rules.
Tony, it's me, remember?
I know I'm a policy.
I'm not Gloria anymore.
I know that.
You got a minute?
Smoke a cigarette with me, will you?
Well, hello.
Sorry to meet you guys.
Long as you're here, why don't you sit down?
This is Gloria.
A lot of money, which Gloria knows, as she's one of us, has been jeopardized.
Let me tell you about this kid.
I know you all approve of mothers.
I know you all had mothers.
Me, I'm not a mother.
I'm one of those sensations.
I was always a broad.
Can't stand the sight of milk.
Okay, I know you guys are going to have your day.
But maybe I could have a drink?
Do you think I could have a drink?
Nice girl.
Tell me about the boy.
Kill me.
What are you trying to say, Gloria?
Life is very dear.
Do you think I want to kill you?
I made love with you.
I bought you jewels.
He made a mistake.
He knew names, dates, money, account numbers and he wrote it all down in that book.
Did you read the book?
Yeah, I read the book.
Popeye, Mickey Mouse. So what?
The father turned state's evidence.
He was talking to FBI, CIA. Big mouth.
He hurt a lot of people.
People that liked him.
The boy didn't see the murder.
He was with me.
I don't like this kid.
You can't go around shooting our people.
Every time we try to talk to you, you pull a gun.
You killed people.
People get angry.
I understand. You are a woman.
He is a little boy.
You fall in love.
Every woman is a mother.
You love him.
I love Phil?
We need the boy.
This kid is and I'm just saying this because I don't know what the hell else to say he's a very smart. you know, an ingenious guy that I think is one of the greatest guys I ever slept with, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I know.
You want to shoot me, go ahead shoot.
I hope I'm not holding you up.
Tony, you know I don't want to be tortured.
So if you're a friend of mine, just do it quick, okay?
Tell you what, Mr. T. I'm going to get up, walk out of here now. You want to stop me, you can.
She's leaving.
Give me the Magnum.
Hello.
Are you the man in 310 A?
Yes, I am the man.
This is the desk.
We want to know if you're checking out.
I don't know.
All right, then you'll be keeping the room?
Yes.
We'll be staying here for two days.
Fine. We're just checking.
Can I have change for this, please?
How do you want it?
All $5 bills and five $1 bills.
Pittsburgh.
So where you going?
I don't know.
I've never been to Pittsburgh before.
I think I was supposed to take a later train.
Maybe you can call them.
They're at the cemetery.
Which cemetery is that?
I forgot the name of it.
Carson Memorial?
That's it.
That's a long way from here.
Want me to give you a lift?
No, thanks.
You're a very nice man.
Want to wait for me?
I want to go back to town.
How much money do you have?
Buddy, don't worry about it.
I have money.
Is that enough, or is it going to cost me more?
Hello, Gloria.
How are you?
I miss you.
But I know you're dead.
And I want you to know that I know you're dead.
Anyway, give my love to my family.
And I know you'll be seeing each other.
My mother loved you anyway even though I didn't till now.
I made it to Pittsburgh, and.... Amen.
Aren't you gonna kiss your grandmother?
It looks like a paradise, but it is the most treacherous desert in the world:
The Kalahari.
After the short rainy season there are many water holes, and even rivers.
But after a few weeks, the water sinks away into the deep Kalahari sand.
The water holes dry, and the rivers stop flowing.
The grass fades to a beautiful blond colour that offers excellent grazing for the animals.
But for the next nine months, there'll be no water to drink.
So most of the animals move away, leaving the blond grass uneaten.
Humans avoid the Kalahari like the plague because man must have water.
So the beautiful landscapes are devoid of people. Except for the little people of the Kalahari.
Pretty, dainty, small and graceful, the Bushmen.
Where any other person would die of thirst in a few days they live quite contentedly in this desert.
They know where to dig for roots and bugs and tubers and which berries and pods are good to eat.
Of course they know what to do about water.
In the early morning, you can collect dewdrops from leaves that were carefully laid out the previous evening.
Or a plume of grass can be a reservoir.
If you have the know-how, a clump of twigs can tell you where to dig and you come to light with an enormous tuber.
You scrape shavings off it with a stick that is split for a sharp edge. You take a handful of the shavings, point your thumb at your mouth and squeeze.
They must be the most contented people in the world.
They have no crime, no punishment, no violence, no laws no police, judges, rulers or bosses.
They believe that the gods put only good and useful things on the earth for them.
In this world of theirs, nothing is bad or evil.
Even a poisonous snake is not bad.
You just have to keep away from the sharp end.
Actually, a snake is very good. In fact, it's delicious.
And the skin makes a fine pouch.
They live in the vastness of the Kalahari in small family groups.
One family of Bushmen might meet up with another once in a few years.
But for the most part, they live in complete isolation unaware there are other people in the world.
In the deep Kalahari, there are Bushmen who have not heard of civilized man.
Sometimes they hear a thundering sound when there are no clouds.
They assume the gods have eaten too much and their tummies are rumbling.
Sometimes they can even see the evidence of the gods' flatulence.
Their language has an idiosyncrasy of its own. It seems to consist mainly of clicking sounds.
They're very gentle people.
They'll never punish a child or even speak harshly to it.
So the kids are extremely well-behaved.
Their games are cute and inventive.
When the family needs meat the hunter dips his arrow in a brew that acts as a tranquilliser.
When he shoots a buck, it feels a sting and the arrow drops out.
The buck runs away, but soon it gets drowsy and it stops running.
After a while, it goes to sleep.
The hunter apologizes. He explains that his family needs the meat.
The characteristic which really makes them different from all other races is that they have no sense of ownership at all.
Where they live, there's nothing you can own.
Only trees and grass and animals.
These Bushmen have never seen a stone or a rock in their lives.
The hardest things they know are wood and bone.
They live in a gentle world, where nothing is as hard as rock, steel or concrete.
Only 600 miles to the south, there's a vast city.
And here you find civilized man.
Civilized man refused to adapt himself to his environment.
Instead he adapted his environment to suit him.
So he built cities, roads, vehicles, machinery.
And he put up power lines to run his labour-saving devices.
But he didn't know when to stop.
The more he improved his surroundings to make life easier the more complicated he made it.
Now his children are sentenced to 10 to 15 years of school, to learn how to survive in this complex and hazardous habitat.
And civilized man, who refused to adapt to his surroundings now finds he has to adapt and re-adapt every hour of the day to his self-created environment.
For instance, if it's Monday and 7:30 comes up, you have to dis- adapt from your domestic surroundings and re-adapt yourself to an entirely different environment.
8:00 means everybody has to look busy.
I've got a good story about handicapped children.
Handicapped children? No!
You don't recommend stuff you don't...
Sorry. I'll only print sweetness and light, even if it bores the pants off them.
10:30 means you can stop looking busy for 15 minutes.
And then, you have to look busy again.
Can you use this about the teacher shortage in Botswana?
- Good story?
- Yeah.
They'll take anybody who can read and write.
I don't know. I got bawled out for writing a story on mugging.
My page should be sweet and light, like Liberace and Jackie Onassis.
Your day is chopped into pieces.
In each segment of time... - ...you adapt to new circumstances.
- May I share a table?
No wonder some people go off the rails a bit.
Does the noise in my head bother you?
Still got that story about the teacher shortage in Botswana?
- Yeah. You gonna use it?
- No. Maybe they can use me.
In the Kalahari, it's always Tuesday, or Thursday if you like. Or Sunday.
No clocks or calendars tell you to do this or that.
Lately, strange new things sometimes appeared in the sky.
Noisy birds that flew without flapping their wings.
One day, something fell from the sky.
Xi had never seen anything like this in his life.
It looked like water, but it was harder than anything else in the world.
He wondered why the gods had sent this thing down to the earth.
It was the strangest and most beautiful thing they had ever seen.
They wondered why the gods had sent it to them.
Pabo got his finger stuck in the thing and the children thought he was very funny.
Xi tried the thing out to cure thongs.
It had the right shape and weight.
It was also beautifully smooth and ideal for curing snakeskin.
And Pabo discovered you could make music on it.
And every day they discovered a new use for the thing.
It was harder and heavier and smoother than anything they'd ever known.
It was the most useful thing the gods had ever given them.
A real labour-saving device.
But the gods had been careless. They had sent only one.
Now, for the first time, here was a thing that could not be shared because there was only one of it.
Suddenly, everybody needed it most of the time.
A thing they had never needed before became a necessity.
And unfamiliar emotions began to stir. A feeling of wanting to own, of not wanting to share.
Other new things came. Anger, jealousy, hate and violence.
Xi was angry with the gods.
He shouted, "Take back your thing!
We don't want it!
Look at the trouble it brought. "
The gods did not take it back.
He shouted, "You must be crazy to send us this thing!
Take it back!"
Then he shouted, "Look out! Look out!"
But he spoke too late and the thing felled his daughter Dani.
Xi carried the thing away from the shelter and buried it.
That evening, there was no laughter and no chatter around the family fire.
A strange feeling of shame had come over the family and they were very quiet.
Xi said, "I have buried the thing.
It will not make us unhappy again. "
That night, a hyena smelled the blood on the thing, and dug it up.
A bad-tempered warthog chased the hyena away and it dropped the thing.
The next day, Dani found it.
Her brother Toma heard her playing on it and said, "Let me try. Let me try too."
That night the family was very unhappy.
They began to talk about this thing. They did not have a name for it.
They called it the "evil thing."
Gaboo said, "Perhaps the gods were absent-minded when they dropped the evil thing on the earth.
They've always sent only good things, like rain, trees, roots and berries to eat.
We are their children and they love us.
But now they've sent this evil thing. "
Xi said, "The thing does not belong on the earth.
Tomorrow I will take it to the end of the earth and throw it off. "
Gobo said, "I think the end of the earth must be very far.
I think you'll have to walk for 20 days. Perhaps 40. "
Xi said, "I will start walking tomorrow."
Two thousand miles to the north in the state of Birani trouble was brewing.
It's 35 million to combat erosion in the valley.
- And 6 million for improvement of the...
- Hold it, minister. We can't expect...
Get out. We need the car.
That was Sam Boga's gang.
You said they were in Cabinda.
- That's what I thought.
- How many got away?
There were two jeeps.
Four got away.
- Sam Boga was there?
- No.
This time, he's got to die.
Find him and kill him yourself.
Bring him here.
Where is Sam Boga?
Where is your hideout?
Bring the one in the corridor.
Bring that one.
Where is Sam Boga?
Where is your hideout?
Take them to the helicopter.
They went south.
- I'll direct you from the helicopter.
- Yes, sir.
Gas guzzler.
Four of the eight assassins got away in two jeeps.
The other four were shot in the Cabinet room by the security guards.
- Bastards.
- The assassins wore brown T-shirts the trademark of the terrorist gang led by the notorious Sam Boga.
However, eyewitnesses state Sam Boga did not take part in the assassination.
It is assumed that he masterminded the attack, some distance from the capital.
Sources announced that the assassins killed the ministers of education, public works and agriculture.
The president, who survived the hail of bullets with only a flesh wound will be addressing the nation in a few moments.
We did it!
We did it! We got the president, and five of his ministers!
You didn't, you know.
That's him.
It was the will of the Almighty that I was spared.
We mourn the deaths of three members of my Cabinet.
We extend our deepest sympathies...
He's lying.
We got six.
I saw them go down.
You killed three and wounded five.
And you lost four.
Why do I have to work with amateurs?
Did you get away clean?
Yes, we were in and out in two minutes.
They will never find us.
Attention.
- What happened?
- We ran out of gas.
- How long ago?
- About 15 minutes, sir.
Now, you tell me.
Where is Sam Boga?
Where is your hideout?
Next time you're going to be a bit higher.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!
The banana forest at Dumgaze.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!
I'll show you. The banana forest at Dumgaze.
I'll tell you. I'll show you where.
- Do you hear me?
- Right here, general.
- Banana forest at Dumgaze. Follow me.
- Right, general.
The man we want is the president, not the bloody minister of education.
Understand?
I'll come with you.
We'll get him in his bed.
Cover up! Cover up!
Come on. Mount the bazooka.
Move it, move it!
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!
Now take cover.
You, you go there.
Not there, you bloody fool.
Get out of there.
- Well?
- They're there. They're there.
You cannot see them, but they're there.
You see, there they are.
Okay.
No, hold it.
Okay.
Shit.
Cut it out, man!
- Born to be our champion.
- You showed them.
Quiet.
Stand by.
The most inquisitive creature in Africa is the baboon.
Xi said, "That is a very evil thing you've got.
You better give it back so I can take it and throw it off the earth.
It brought unhappiness to my family.
If you don't give it to me it'll bring grief to you and your family too. "
He spoke long and earnestly until the baboon began to pay attention.
He must have convinced it, and it dropped the thing.
And Xi said, "You have done a very wise thing."
- So you want to go to Botswana?
- I want to get away from all this.
But in the Kalahari?
Mom, it's not in the Kalahari.
Botswana isn't all desert.
Get in there.
Why do they put the nuts where you can't get at them?
Right in my bloody face.
Every year I have to lay here on my back.
Keep it down a bit, Mpudi.
I'm trying to tune the scanner.
Okay, Mpudi. Go ahead.
Every year you come here with a bigger and better tent and equipment.
And every year, you turn up with this and I have to work my ass off.
That's funny. This elephant's dung shows a complete lack of boron.
Hello, Reverend.
What are you doing on a horse?
I hit a rock with my crankcase. Cracked it wide open.
The trouble is, I have to meet the new schoolteacher at Mabula.
You can have that one, but she's in a terrible shape.
We've been knocking around in the Hamadulas.
I promised Mpudi that I'd work here, so he could have a week to patch it.
- Thank you. - Get in there, you bloody...
Morning, Mpudi.
- Will this make it to Mabula and back?
She's gonna be a bastard to start. Sorry, Reverend.
- I put in new rings and they're tight.
- But will she make it?
You said I could have a whole week.
This is an emergency.
We want to know if she'll make it to Mabula and back.
I haven't looked at the brakes or steering gear.
- Okay, she'll make it.
As soon as I connect the steering rack, but she'll be a bastard to start.
There we are, Reverend.
Then she'll be all yours.
I don't think I can handle her.
I hear Mpudi calls her the antichrist.
Well, she is a thing.
I was hoping... I was ho...
- I was hoping you could go.
- I'm very awkward around women.
- Yes, aren't we all?
- No, it's not like that.
When I'm in the presence of a lady, my brain switches off or something.
- I turn into an idiot.
- You ought to meet more women.
- It only gets worse.
- But you will do this for me?
Come on, Prince. Come on.
Son of a... Choke.
Choke, choke, choke, choke.
You tried to murder me, you son of a...
Don't switch her off or let her stall.
You'll never start her.
Don't park on a slope. You got no hand brake.
Now you tell me.
- Take care, now.
One day, a very noisy animal rushed past where Xi was sleeping.
It left very peculiar tracks, as if two enormous snakes had slithered past.
Everybody lie down on the ground.
All of you, lie down!
Come on, lie down, you and you!
Hey, you!
Didn't you hear me? Lie down!
He can't hear you, sir.
- He's deaf.
- Shut up!
Hey, wake up!
Come and give us petrol here.
Did two jeeps pass here?
Yes, sir. They took half my stock.
They took a big can of petrol, and they made me to lie down.
If you find them, ask them. They must pay me my money.
It's a lot of stuff they took.
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes.
- My name...
- How do...?
My name...
My name is...
My name is Andrew Steyn.
How do you do?
The Reverend cracked his crankcase, so he asked me to...
How far do we have to go?
How far do we have to go?
How...?
Oh, sorry.
- I'm sorry, madam. Sorry.
- It's all right.
Here. I'm truly sorry, madam. Sorry.
It's all right.
What are you doing?
What...? What...? What are you...?
Your brakes are shot.
I'm opening the gate.
How do I get out of here?
No, it's all right. I...
Now I just...
- Oh, this is too weird. I'm getting out.
- No, it's okay. I just have to...
- What are you doing now?
- I'm closing the gate. But don't worry.
Are you crazy?
It has no brakes!
Do you wanna get me killed?
- Are you crazy?
- All right, it'll come back.
- What?
- The Land Rover, it'll come back.
- What do you mean, it'll come back?
- It's all right.
- I suppose you think it was funny.
- I'm sorry. The brakes don't work.
I noticed.
Xi saw a strange-looking person, and greeted him.
But the man didn't hear him.
Xi said, "This is a funny stick.
Did it grow on a tree?"
He couldn't understand why he ran away.
He realized the man must've seen the evil thing he was carrying. That's what made him run.
- She stopped.
- I noticed.
Can you start her again?
No. We gave her new rings, and they're very tight.
- How far are we from the mission?
- About 30 miles.
- Will we get there before dark?
- I don't know.
- This thing has stopped.
- I noticed.
Are you sure you can't start her?
Yes. This morning it took a horse and three men.
- So now what?
- I can make a fire.
And there's some food and a sleeping bag.
Spend the night?
I'm afraid so.
You sure this thing's stopped?
Yes. Didn't you notice?
I can carry you across. Then you don't have to...
Okay.
Watch it! Be careful!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Look at my dress! I lost my shoes!
- Your what?
- My shoes.
I'm sorry.
Well, watch it, buster.
- Sorry. I'll fetch your bags.
- No! You'll drop them!
I'll get them myself.
I'm all right. I'm okay.
Leave that one.
I don't need it.
Idiot.
What are you doing? Leave me alone!
Don't you dare!
- Go away!
- It's all right. She's gone!
Keep away! You keep away from me!
No, I wasn't... There was this warthog.
- What warthog?
- She's gone, but...
Keep away.
- I wasn't...
- Go away!
I wasn't...
I didn't...
Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner when he was rudely interrupted.
Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner when he was rudely interrupted.
The rhino is the self-appointed fire-prevention officer.
When he sees a fire, he rushes in and stamps it out.
- Do you work here in Botswana?
- Yes, I...
Yes. Yes.
And what do you do?
I... I collect manure. I...
Get away from... Get away from...
Leave me alone!
Miss Thompson?
Oh, it's all right. He's gone.
- Who's gone?
- The rhinoceros.
What bloody rhinoceros?
Didn't you see him?
He stamped out the fire.
You stamped out the fire. I saw you.
No, he did it first.
I didn't want him to come back, so...
- But didn't you see?
- Keep away.
Miss Thompson, if you make a fire, and a rhinoceros sees it he comes and stamps it out.
Rhinos do that.
It's a most interesting phenomenon.
You get sudden urges, and come up with warthogs and rhinoceroses.
All right, I'll show you.
I'll make another fire.
Think I'm lying.
I'll show you.
You see how I'm making another fire?
You'll see he'll come back.
Think I'm a liar.
Maybe it's too far away.
Maybe it's upwind.
Ask them.
They'll tell you rhinoceroses always stamp out fires.
I don't speak the language.
Okay, I'll ask them.
- See?
- I noticed.
They're Tswanas.
They always shake their heads when they mean to say yes.
What are you doing?
I'm making coffee.
Some people didn't show me their passports.
They smashed the barrier. They've got guns.
This is Frank.
- Were they in two jeeps?
- Yes, sir.
They're being followed by armoured cars.
Can you see them?
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, sir. I can see one.
- Stop them!
Yes, sir.
Frank?
Frank, what was that noise?
I stopped them, sir.
Right. Explain that they cannot cross our border under arms.
We cannot allow them to violate our territorial integrity.
Request permission to cross your border in hot pursuit of Sam Boga.
Sorry. We cannot allow an armed force to come into Botswana.
I gotta get Sam Boga. He shot up half our Cabinet.
Our police will track him down and hand him over to you, dead or alive.
Can't they help us?
They'll take a message to the river.
I think I can get the thing out of the river.
There's an electric winch on the front.
- Miss Thompson? - Could you help me, please?
Don't look.
That's a watape tree.
You mustn't go near a watape tree. They grab you.
Could you hand me my gown, please?
It's in the suitcase.
The pink one with the white edging.
Sorry.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
That morning, Xi saw the ugliest person he'd ever come across.
She was as pale as something that had crawled out of a rotting log.
Her hair was quite gruesome long and stringy and white, as if she was very old.
She was very big.
You'd have to dig the whole day to find enough food to feed her.
Go away.
Although it was a hot day, she was wearing skins that looked as if they were made from cobwebs.
She was doing strange and magical things.
It struck him that she must be one of the gods.
He wondered what she was doing on earth.
He was glad he met her. He'd give her the evil thing and go home to his family.
He said tactfully that he didn't need the thing, and she could have it back.
But she was very rude, and she walked away.
- That's a Bushman. How'd he get here?
- I don't know. He's rude.
There was another god. He had a fire inside him.
The smoke came out through his mouth and nostrils.
Xi said politely, "It was kind of you to send us this thing but it made my family unhappy. Please take it. "
Sorry, no sabe.
Where's the truck?
I'll try and get it down.
There was a peculiar sound, and Xi saw a most amazing animal approaching.
Its legs went around instead of up and down.
And there was a weird-looking god on its back.
He wore blue skin on his head and red on his body.
And hair grew on his face.
What the hell happened?
Where have you been?
The funny thing was that they couldn't speak.
They made sounds like monkeys.
- Hi.
- What happened? Where's the antichrist?
What the hell did you do that for, huh?
I'll tell you later.
Let's get it down.
And the little Bushman? What's he doing in these parts?
I don't know. He was trying to tell me something.
- You speak Bushman?
- Yeah.
The hairy one could speak.
He says, "Thanks for the bottle, but you can have it back."
I didn't give it to him.
- Well, he don't want the bottle.
- Then he'd better throw it away.
The hairy one said, "We don't want it.
You'll have to throw it away yourself. "
Xi was very disappointed.
It was unfair of the gods to make him throw it off the earth.
In fact, he began to doubt whether they really were gods.
Get out!
Get out! Get out! Get in there.
Get in there! Move it!
Move it!
Yes, yes, yes. Here comes the great white hunter to the rescue.
Miss Thompson, I presume.
Hello, Steyn.
How would you like to travel in style for a change?
Yes, thank you.
How do you open this thing?
With a can opener?
Quaint.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Steyn, for...
By the way, I am Jack Hind.
The Reverend's worried.
He got to me on the short-wave so I offered to look for you.
That was very sweet of me.
- It sure was.
- Would you like to sit over there?
Sure.
I don't want to talk about it.
She thinks I'm a lunatic, and I don't blame her.
You know, she asks me what do I do, and I say I collect manure.
I don't tell her I analyse it for my doctoral thesis.
I bet you she thinks I shovel the stuff.
Was it rough?
I'd rather not talk about it.
That rough.
It won't be long now, and your suffering will be over.
When you get there, you'll have to stand there and look beautiful while the whole tribe sings their welcome song at you.
Then you can relax, have a bath and a nice breakfast.
Is it true that when a rhino sees a fire, he stamps it out?
Where did you hear that one? Did Steyn tell you?
Why would he tell you that?
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
- That's all I need.
She wouldn't believe me about the warthog and the rhinoceros.
- What bloody rhinoceros?
- I don't want to talk about it.
So how did this thing get up the tree?
She got stuck in a watape tree and I had to...
You know she's got flowers on her panties?
So that's how this thing got up the tree.
Don't I wave or take a bow or something?
Notorious Communist guerrilla leader Sam Boga and his band have crashed through into Botswana.
- They are heading for Mozambique.
- Well, how many?
Not even 300.
I told you bastards, don't waste ammunition!
Now we can't even fight back anymore.
All of you switch your guns over from automatic to single-fire.
Anyone withholding information which could lead to their capture...
That's automatic. That's single.
Citizens are warned that Sam Boga is a dangerous person and that he and his gang are well-armed.
So it'll be unwise...
And why are you so beautiful?
I'm going to the school to give her these.
You gonna look like that?
- Like what?
- Like it's a funeral.
You've gotta smile and tell her she looks good.
How are you an expert on women?
I got seven wives.
How many you got?
- Why aren't you at home with them?
- I know how to marry them.
- Nobody knows how to live with them.
- So, what did you marry them for?
Someday I have to tell you the facts of life.
"And yet we all agree that every plate we break was cracked by Mr. Nobody.
'Tis he who tears our books, who..."
Come in.
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.
Morning, class.
I... I brought...
Please, just leave it.
I brought you your shoes.
Shoe.
You don't want to talk about it, huh?
Shame.
The animals looked ridiculous but good to eat and he was hungry.
Suddenly a young boy made chattering noises at Xi.
So he said, "I shot one of those animals.
It'll go to sleep soon, and then we can eat it. "
But the boy ran away, maybe to call his family to join in the feast.
There was a weird sound and another of those strange animals with the round legs appeared.
The young boy and a grownup got out of it, and seemed very excited.
Xi said, "Come, sit down. There's enough meat for all of us. "
But the man was rude and greedy.
He took the whole animal.
He said, "You have very bad manners.
If you eat the whole thing, I'll have to shoot another for myself. "
The man shouted, but he didn't want anything to do with such an uncouth person, so he ignored him.
Suddenly there was a thunderclap.
The animals ran away, and he ran after them.
He was very hungry.
Do you speak English?
You are free to remain silent until you have seen your lawyer.
If you speak now, whatever you say will be taken down as evidence against you.
And why are you so beautiful?
I got to go to court.
What did you do?
The cops were here. They say they caught a little Bushman for stock theft.
They say all he can speak is "Xixo," so they want me to interpret.
Xixo.
Xixo.
They brought Xi into a place with several people.
He smiled at them in greeting, but nobody smiled back.
Interpreter.
You, Xixo, are hereby charged with wrongfully and unlawfully slaughtering one goat on the 21st of September, 1980, in Oniamatokwe.
How plead you?
Guilty or not guilty?
Mpudi found it difficult to interpret because, in his language there was no word for "guilty."
Finally he asked, "Did you shoot an animal?"
Xi said, "Yes, I did, but that man took it.
He did not want to share it with me. "
- Well, what does he plead?
- Not guilty.
- They gave him the death sentence.
- For killing a goat? No.
Three months in jail, same thing.
He gonna die for sure.
He never seen a wall. Now, he got walls all around him.
But didn't you explain to them?
- They said, "Silence in court."
- Yeah, but surely they ought to know.
Nobody knows the Bushmen.
Nobody ever goes into the deep Kalahari.
How come you know so much about them?
When Botswana belonged to the British, I hit a policeman for insulting my father.
So I fled, right into the Kalahari.
I died, you know. Dehydration.
Some of those little buggers found me, and buried me.
Only my head stuck out.
For two weeks, they pushed water and food into my mouth.
And when they dug me up, I was nearly white.
I lived with them for three years.
They're the sweetest little buggers.
He gonna die for sure.
Can I go to Mahadi tomorrow?
You wanna go and see little what's his name?
I want to get him out.
Now, don't do anything silly.
They got to let him out.
Maybe if we explain to them.
- You coming too?
- Yes.
Says he's sorry.
He try to eat the food tomorrow.
- Has he eaten anything? It's been a week.
- No.
Of course we're worried.
We can't force-feed him.
- You've got to let him out.
- He's got 11 weeks to go.
Well, is there no way? Can't we buy him out or something?
Well, if somebody wants to employ him as a convict-labourer.
But he has no experience, no qualifications.
He got qualifications.
He can teach you things about plants and animals.
Yes.
We want to employ him as an ecological expert.
He will have to remain in your employ for the full 11 weeks.
If he leaves, we will hunt him down and lock him up for a long time.
We can't put him inside.
No, you're right.
I understand the words, but the meaning...
Talks about a bad thing, an evil thing. And about the end of the world.
Well, explain to him he has to stay with us for the full 11 weeks.
- He doesn't know from weeks.
- We'll tell him when it's okay to go.
I hear a Bushman's working for you.
Yeah, his name is Xi.
- Are they good trackers?
- Best in the world.
Mind if I borrow him?
One of my guests wounded a cougar. My trackers can't find it.
This is where we lost him.
You'll see, he'll find him.
Hey! Hey!
Scram, go away!
Get!
Go away!
- I'm sorry, I didn't realise...
- I don't want to talk about it.
What do you want?
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Get them out.
Come on. Get him.
Hurry up, man.
You can drop those guns.
Bastard.
You want me to let fly?
Now get out. With your hands up.
Bring out all the kids.
Sergeant, I'm going to walk due east from here to Motambe and I'm taking all these kids with me.
If I see one truck or one aeroplane or one policeman or one soldier or one person we'll mow these kids down.
- Have you got shortwave in there?
- Yes.
Now get on to headquarters, and tell them I want a corridor 10 miles wide.
The army and the police better clear out everybody.
And they've got to put down food and water every 20 miles. And then get the hell out of the way before we get there.
Tell them that.
All right, get them into a circle. I want a big circle around me.
Leave the small ones. It's miles to Motambe.
They'll never make it.
Okay, now buzz off.
Clear out the people from this end because I want to start marching in two hours.
And I warn you, you better clear out everybody.
Clutch.
Brake. Brake.
Clutch.
Clutch!
I'm teaching him to drive. Just for the hell of it.
Nothing else to do around here anyhow.
- Still mooning about the schoolmarm?
- Sort of.
I want to move up to Nioko for a few days so we can do a game count.
- How will this get us through the jungle?
- We strip it down.
Come on, Xi.
Come on!
He don't know from doors.
Stop playing that bloody game.
Okay, it's time. Let's go.
Move them.
Come on. Everybody up.
Come on, let's go. Keep them going.
Keep them in a circle around me.
Move them! Don't leave any stragglers.
- Keep your paws to yourself!
- Shut up.
Get them into a circle. A circle, a circle!
- Stop yelling at them.
- That's not a bloody circle.
- Can't you do anything right?
- I can't get them into a circle.
They keep coming up in a square.
Then, make it a square. Let them walk in a square.
Keep them going.
Don't let them straggle.
Who says they'll come this way?
He says he wants a corridor 10 miles wide.
I'm sorry. We'll have to get out of the way for now until he passes this point.
Where can I find Andrew Steyn?
You'd better warn him too.
He's five miles that way.
You turn right at the...
Damn it, I'll come and show you.
Johnny, will you take them to Machadi?
Tell them to sing.
Come on, everybody. Sing, sing!
Now where do we find him?
They left this morning.
They went through.
They'll meet up with Boga for sure.
- Is there a way around this?
- It's a hell of a long way.
Well, let's go.
One, two, three, four, five six adult oryx.
He says there are people things down there.
- Where?
- Down there.
Army truck.
Unloading something.
I wonder what they're up to.
Looks like food.
Cooking pots and stuff.
Maybe it's a picnic.
Funny. They're going away.
- They went away and left their stuff.
- Yeah, funny.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
You've got to let them rest.
The smaller ones can't keep up.
They can rest when they get to the food.
- You're driving them too hard.
- It's a long way to Motambe.
You said 20 miles. They can't walk 20 miles without eating.
Halt!
Look at that!
I told you, stop playing that bloody game!
You've got to let the little ones turn back.
Nobody turns back.
Next thing, everybody's gonna get sore feet.
Next one drops out, I shoot him!
You, you, help her.
If you got to carry her, carry her.
If I catch you playing again, by God...
March!
They can't march 20 miles.
They're not soldiers!
If they want to eat, they'd better march 20 miles!
Are you scared it'll spoil your image if you admit you made a mistake?
You!
Come here!
See that hill over there?
Go to the top, and wave this thing until the army people see you.
Then you go down to them, and tell them Sam Boga made a mistake. Now I want them to leave food every 10 miles.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Now, get going. Move!
One ostrich and four, five six, seven, eight...
A lot of children.
The food must have been left there for them.
- What the hell? They've got guns.
- The kids?
No. There are men down there with guns.
It's no picnic.
I think those kids are hostages.
What was that on the news about Sam Boga?
That man said I must go to the top, and I must wave my conga.
So Miss Kate said 20 miles is too much.
- Is she down there?
- Yes.
We'll have to immobilise them.
- Are Bushmen good stalkers?
- Best in the world.
Let him have a look at them.
Explain to him that the men with the guns are bad. We have to put them to sleep.
He want to know how did those people get in there?
No, no, they're not...
You explain.
One hour, then we move!
I'm gonna have a snooze.
"Dear Miss Thompson:
Your abductors have been injected with an immobiliser.
When they go to sleep, you must disarm them."
Tell him he must give her the note only after he's shot all the men.
When he shoots, he must pull back on the thread quickly so the man can think it was a horsefly or a wasp that stung him.
He's fast. It'll work.
He must dip the needle each time.
I can't see the little bugger.
Yeah, I see him.
Now, look at that.
Yeah, he's clever.
Nothing's happening down there.
It takes time.
Who are you?
Some of those guys are down.
She'll need help when they wake up.
Hey, wake up, man.
You gotta wake up.
Come on, you can't sleep now.
Come on.
We need some rope.
There's plenty in the Land Rover.
He can fetch it. I didn't teach him for nothing.
Says he don't understand the gears.
- Told him he can drive in any gear.
- Let's go!
And you take that one.
And you, that one.
And I'll take...
There's only six. There should be eight.
Maybe they're asleep as well.
I don't know.
I want you to circulate among the children. Quietly. And tell them that when we grab the guns they must run fast into that crevice behind us and take cover.
Okay? Good.
Ready?
Go!
No! Get down, get down!
And stay there!
Get back! All of you!
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry.
We've got to outflank them. You go around.
I'll keep you covered.
Get back! Get back!
- You okay?
- Yep.
- Who are they shooting at?
- I don't know.
Four, five, six.
Two are missing.
This one here, and I heard shots from over there.
Look.
Roll over.
Mpudi, hold him.
What's happened?
Have you got water in there?
Hold these for me.
- Get up.
- But what happened, man?
Oh, it's a long story.
What happened to those guys?
Are they all dead?
Did you kill them?
They've been immobilised.
Where's Kate and the kids?
They're hiding back there. They can come out now.
Keep that guy covered.
Kate! It's okay.
You can come out now!
We've got everything under control.
You can come out!
- Jack?
- Hi there. The marines have landed.
It's okay. You can all come out.
All right, come on. Come on.
You're safe now.
Better collect those men before they wake up. You were right.
- Did you fix him good?
- Yeah, get up.
Walk.
Boy, you had a tough time, huh?
Watch out!
Stop fooling around, Steyn.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's all right, Steyn.
Move.
Sergeant, get on the radio and organise some buses to take the kids home.
How come suddenly he the big hero?
We'd better get back to our equipment.
Says thank you, goodbye and hopes you have lots of children.
- Tell him thanks.
I'll miss him. - He can't use that.
- I have to...
- Bushmen don't know about money.
- What can I give him?
- There's nothing here he can use.
- Bushmen don't need things.
- He's gotta take the money. It's the law.
He's going the wrong way.
The Kalahari's that way.
Says he got to find the evil thing and get rid of it.
I don't know.
- I'm going to miss the little bugger.
- Yeah, me too.
- You gonna look like that forever?
- Like what?
Like Jack Hind is better than you.
- No, I'm going to talk to her.
- Tell her you were the big hero.
No, I can't do that.
But I do want to talk to her.
I'll tell her...
I'll say, "Look, Miss Thompson I know you think I'm an idiot but normally I'm quite normal.
It's only when I'm in the presence of a lady that I...
It's really just an interesting psychological phenomenon.
If a man who is susceptible to a type of para-Freudian syndrome like this encounters a nubile female, what happens?"
I suppose another big word happens.
- Too erudite?
- Yeah, whatever that means.
Okay. I'll put it more simply.
I'll say:
"Look, Miss Thompson.
Kate.
Kate.
It's really only an interesting psychological phenomenon."
She'll understand that bit.
She's a schoolteacher.
I'll say, "When there's no lady present I can catch an insect without hurting it."
If she knew me better, she'd see I'm not a stumblebum.
- All I need is a little practise. If I...
- Wait for me. You need moral support.
There she is.
You better do your thing before the pupils come.
- How are you? - Fine, thanks.
How are you?
Fine, thanks, and how are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
Kate I know you think I'm an idiot but I'm not really like that.
Around you.
I'm sorry.
Normally, I'm quite normal.
But whenever I'm in the presence of a lady my fingers turn into thumbs, my brain switches off.
Watch it!
It's flour.
I noticed.
It's actually...
Actually, it's really only an interesting psychological phenomenon.
Perhaps it's some Freudian syndrome.
When I brought you your shoes, I came to apologise for the stupid things I did when I met you at Mabula.
To explain that I'm not as stupid as that.
But then, of course, I blew it, and I...
So I don't blame you if you think...
But it's really only an interesting psychological...
When you get to know me better, you'll see that I'm not always stumbling.
It's really just an interesting psychological phenomenon.
Yes, you are a very interesting psychological phenomenon. And I think you're very sweet.
Xi was beginning to think he'd never find the end of the earth.
And one day, suddenly, there it was.
Film Unit PERSPEKTYWA presents
Still nothing.
No place to move this shit.
How about a smack on the bottom?
- You're in the way.
- Wait a moment longer.
He's moving.
Screenplay
Inspired by a legend and themes from DER GOLEM by Gustav Meyrink
Reflexes...
Unconditioned - normal...
He's coming round.
Plug his mouth.
What with?
Anything. That newspaper will do.
Music
The muck's come out postmature. IQ I'd say... below sixty.
- What about the matrix?
- Alive?
He looks quite nice.
Photography
Take the paper out or he'll choke.
Damn. It was my paper. Still unread.
I'll examine them both tomorrow.
Directed by
THE GOLEM
41 years after an atomic disaster the society, which was in danger of extinction ...bred rumours that artificial men were being created.
One of the sources was the ancient legend of a dummy brought to life when a magic formula was put in his mouth.
That such experiments might be part of the program for reconstruction of mankind is an obvious superstition.
When did you last have your eyes treated?
You are on Dr Wassory's list of patients.
Not possible, I don't know any Dr Wassory.
Nonsense!
You know he's dead.
Sign this statement.
- I've never seen Dr Wassory.
- Don't you realize where you are now?
Very well...
So your name is Pernat?
I want to help the enquiry, but how?
There is one way of doing that.
What can I testify?
You know more about me than I do.
I don't know my neighbours. You know that too.
You asked me what my father's name was. I just don't know.
You've lived in that building for 30 years.
You speak fluently, you are a normal, regular citizen. And now you are sitting here and...
Well, are you or aren't you?
I work...
A man died next door to you.
He was a doctor, a man needed by other people.
Do you get it? That makes all your pleas of ignorance assume an utterly different significance.
Need this? - No.
- How are you doing?
Moron.
I want to help the enquiry! But I don't know what to say as I know less than you!
We'll begin at the beginning. Your name?
This was embedded in Dr Wassory's gullet. An awkward instrument, but nevertheless used to murder him.
What's your view as a neighbour?
My technique is etching with acid, or engraving.
Like hell it is!
A floor below you there dies our best cataract specialist.
In these circumstances your "I don't know"...
But it's the honest truth.
You're slow on the uptake.
You'll leave here, go on functioning, but you refuse to help us! And that is sad.
What are you working on now?
I have a commission for a copper engraving.
I copy the sketch on the plate and enlarge it.
What do you use to do that?
A burin.
Have you ever cut yourself in the process?
The burin sometimes slips. But the cut's merely a scratch.
Have you ever cut yourself in the neck?
No.
I've never done anybody any injury.
What does this engraving depict?
- A man dangling in the air. As if they'd meant to crucify him, but managed to catch hold of only one leg and left him hanging there suspended by it.
No.
- What sort of poppycock is this?
- You asked me.
Are your things in the repository?
Take this and claim them.
You're free to leave.
Just like that?
What is it?
- Are you collecting or depositing?
- I'm leaving.
- Read out the number and the symbol.
- GZ-565.
Wait there!
You're not allowed inside.
Give me the tag.
Mine were different.
The number and the symbol tally.
But it's not mine.
You'd best try it on.
Complaints tend to take time.
What am I to do?
Leave in this?
If you want to leave at all, just get going.
Gentlemen, wait!
You've lost your glasses.
Am I right?
I did as I should, didn't I?
Wait a minute!
I had cigarettes and matches.
The coat's not mine, though I had one like it stolen.
The cigarettes are the same.
Where are the matches?
Why did you take them from me?
Did you have to steal them!
I can give you another box...
Is this your coat?
I don't know.
I never liked coats.
Need fire?
No thanks. I don't smoke.
I only carry a pack with me. At night people sometimes need a cigarette.
Some drunk, say, or loony.
I can't smoke because it's bad for me.
Will you return me my matches?
I'm neither a drunk nor a loony.
But I know you and I know that coat.
I was told that you were dead, that you were blind.
Do you know what cataract is?
Doctors kill people, so death to all doctors!
People drift about helplessly like these newspapers tossing in the wind.
All we do is alternate between folly and wisdom, toothless and spineless!
Everything keeps terrifying us!
You're no saint either, but the same as the rest.
I'm going in that direction. How about you?
Going home.
I know where.
You're going to him. You have to, one day.
But remember: He's a criminal!
Who do you mean?
What has he done?
Begotten offspring!
A brood of them!
Not me, honestly, just my brother.
He's blind... Such a dreadful affliction!
It's not the two of us together.
Honestly. Just him.
He's blind. How do you know he'll fancy me?
- Everything will be fine.
- Believe me!
He'd fancy you.
I'll describe your looks afterwards.
I'll describe them in detail.
Very well, but it will cost more.
Why?
- Scent's expensive.
- Why scent?
If he can't see, let him at least smell.
- A lot more?
- Some 50 florins.
If you don't want it that way, you're free to go.
No, no! My brother agrees.
I mean we agree. It's a deal.
Can I come in too?
I mean, sit in?
- It turns you on?
- No, it's not that.
It's only that afterwards... It's a lot of money for us. He likes me to tell him about it afterwards.
- Very well. Come along.
I've been waiting for you.
Why?
Don't be alarmed. I've brought you something.
I don't need anything.
Do you really believe what you say?
This is for you.
It's the reason I'm here.
- What is it?
- People. Billions of people.
I shouldn't accept this.
You already have it.
I mean, you are alive.
You just let him go! ?
It was an accident, a mistake.
The staff is overworked.
It won't occur again.
We'll replace the labels with tattoos.
So this Pernat is wandering about at large?
I'd put it like this:
Neo-Pernat has succeeded Proto-Pernat.
Is he at least alike?
Except for a lowered consciousness. We tested that.
What about the prototype?
We usually liquidate.
I supervised the operation myself.
And who was the original Pernat?
Does it matter?
A jailbird, I believe. Or perhaps a holy man.
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Have you lost your mind?
Don't you recognize me?
No... I mean, yes.
They let you go...
What's the matter?
You seem to have sort of changed. Something's odd...
They questioned me, but I didn't know what to answer.
You knew him better.
Knew who?
What are you talking about?
Dr Wassory, the oculist.
They kept asking about him.
- What's it to do with me?
- The murdered man.
You really have changed.
There's something odd about you.
You're sort of different.
Why should I know that doctor?
You lived next door.
Did you?
Why are you lying?
Because of that room?
I'm entitled to a larger apartment!
It was here.
This is recent!
Piss off!
Why the fuss? It's all done officially.
I'm entitled to it!
It was cleared out.
Why leave it?
Run along, inform on me!
You've got me wrong.
I didn't know that doctor.
I didn't recall him and I wanted you to...
- You've changed.
- I ran into your brother. He said...
Lay off him!
You know he's sick and suffering.
He didn't kill him.
He couldn't kill anybody!
I know what's changed.
You're not wearing glasses.
A kilo of potatoes, please.
A kilo of potatoes, please.
Is something wrong?
No, only you remind me of someone...
Oh yes, potatoes...
You've got to give it to me, love. I must have that money.
I want to get my book back from the pawnshop.
Whatever you have.
I don't have any. You know that's nothing.
Be reasonable.
It's my book!
A part at least. I beg you as a father.
I've got to get my book back.
So you're cheating me. Hiding money from me in these dead bodies?
What of my book?
Where else have you hidden it?
Father, stop it!
I must have that money.
My book...
Try to calm down.
Come along.
You're unfair to your daughter.
Tell me, who exactly are you?
- You're in the wrong.
She, your daughter... - Who are you?
There's no you!
I know you, hollow clay shells.
There's no you!
What do you want?
Why this whole deception?
I bet you're straw inside.
- You're an empty shell, admit it!
- Please try to calm down.
If you are here come along to church and prove it.
I'm in funds.
I can pay.
What church?
This is a cinema!
No, this is the Church of the Transfiguration!
You clay abortion, this is the only place where you can confess your dreams!
Happy Dorm, Happy Dorm!
It's the very thing!
Sleep from night to morn Is what Happy Dorm will bring!
Remember!
Happiness is your obligation.
If your features trouble you modern surgery will help you solve your problems.
Come and see us!
Remember!
Happiness is your obligation.
Come and see us.
Filthy drunks!
Trying to fool me?
I can see your leg!
You'll pay for everything.
The whole mess! Come on out!
Please! I'll be right out. I'll pay for everything.
Give me a hand, Mr. Pernat.
- Here?
- Anywhere you like.
I'll take this corner.
You're with him, Pernat?
You went to him and surrendered!
He's a criminal!
- Any good with watches?
- I can't look him in the eyes!
- My own father!
- He's your son! ?
- Out of disgust!
- I want you to mend my watch.
Let me introduce you: Mr. Pernat...
My Daddy.
Bountiful father!
Thanks to you I have this splendid coat. - I, a Prodigal Son.
- Don't let go of the stove!
This coat is almost like yours.
A father's gift!
Rozyna, do something with him!
Are you angry that I refuse your money?
Do you hear me, mind witless inseminator?
It is I, prodigious procreator, sire of insensate manikins,
I, one of your bungled creatures!
Do you hear me, progenitor?
It is I, your son!
Just a few steps more.
Here we are.
What else do you want?
You mentioned a watch.
You're going to repair it.
You have very deft fingers.
But it's working.
Yes, but backwards.
These hands, which are moving rapidly, are all right. But this little one, which is very slow, is going backwards.
You've given up wearing glasses and you can't see.
You'll repair it.
If I can...
You'll learn. I understand you're gifted.
Your shoulder measurements?
Measurements?
What do you mean?
The width of your shoulders in centimetres.
Why do you want to know?
I'm just asking.
We were to create a new human species, better and tougher.
Pernat comes close to the ideal.
Let him live normally.
Let's not treat him as an experimental rat.
Why the slogans?
Pernat is a trial run, a pilot model.
- We can regard him as a test sample.
- Tests, as with rats?
Mazes, sweets... He's a human being.
What makes you so sure?
Don't be alarmed. I'm from the corporation.
I've come to test the flues.
Is that stove here?
What stove?
This one?
Skip the jokes. I mean a big stove.
This is my only room.
I don't have any other stove.
Well then where's the smoke coming from?
You're the only occupant of the attic!
There wouldn't be space for a second room.
Up here there's got to be a big stove, like a baking oven.
There isn't one. You can see for yourself.
Maybe I can and then again, maybe I can't.
And what are you supposed to be?
An artist?
And on the side you make artistic knick-knacks out of clay?
I told you I've nothing like that.
Holtrum may have.
He bought a large stove recently.
He's the superintendent.
I told you clearly enough. It's coming from this level.
It's not my business, but you'll burn the place down.
Mr Pernat, you've registered your brother.
Why weren't you good enough to inform me?
You must be joking. What brother?
I've received a new register.
There are two Pernats there in black and white.
It must be some mistake.
Sign this summon for a dental check-up.
There's nothing wrong with my teeth.
Maybe, but according to the records you have a denture. Sign.
Here too.
What do you mean?
You don't expect me to go chasing the other Pernat?
And whether I have a stove or not is none of your bloody business!
Come on, Rozyna.
She simply lends a hand.
I've come here, to you...
To get a doll repaired?
I want to take you away from here for a while.
- I can't right now. I have to...
- Just for a moment!
You write the owners' names here?
No one looks under the wigs.
Come on.
I can't right now.
You see, I have to...
You have to what?
Father wants to get a book back.
I must raise the cash.
That book is all that keeps him alive.
I'll lend it to you.
It was you who put the money in the other day?
No, it must have been sewn up inside.
- You're lying. - No.
I can land it to you, honestly.
I can't accept money from you.
I'll lend it to you, but I have to go home for it.
How much do you need?
Two hundred florins.
I'll fetch it.
- Come on in.
- Here is the money.
Don't tell my father I borrowed it from you.
- Who's that?
- I don't even know your name.
Pernat.
Where did you get all that money?
Mr Pernat lent it to us.
You can buy your book back now.
Come here a moment.
You're selling yourself for me, for your father? No.
Nothing like that. Mr Pernat offered the money himself.
She's selling herself?
You've got it all wrong.
- I'm lending the money.
- Who lends money nowadays?
Your daughter said it meant a lot to you.
So you are so kind at heart?
I thought you didn't exist, that you're a dummy.
- So you're different, kind-hearted!
- Stop it!
I'll bring you my book. It will help you.
I know that you need it. We must get it back.
It is my view that observation is not enough.
Full stop.
Especially as one of the Pernat surveillance team suffered an accident in mysterious circumstances.
Not too fast?
To hasten the project's progress we should widen the program of physiological-medical and psychological-social tests.
Please underline the next sentence.
The first step should consist of an interim examination in laboratory conditions.
Who's here for the check-up?
- Name?
- Pernat.
I was summoned to report for a dental check-up.
Show me your teeth.
- Suffering from toothaches?
- No, they seem all right.
I'm inclined to agree.
Please open your left eye.
But I'm here for a dental check-up.
You opened your right eye. Now open the left.
Wider.
This was to be a dental check-up?
Your teeth are okay, so why complain?
That's better.
Do you have a sense of light?
I came for a dental check-up!
You were right to.
One must keep a check on one's health.
I see the beginnings of a cataract.
It's lucky you came to see me.
Early diagnosis, easier treatment.
Now the right eye.
There's a cataract for you! Like a scale.
By rights you should be blind!
Sister, hold his head.
Just a minor operation to make sure.
It will hurt a bit, but I'll give you a sick leave.
You may have some trouble seeing afterwards.
Oh, you gargoyle you!
Stay seated, son, you must eat a lot...
Why won't you let me out of here?
You can't see yourself, so you don't know who you are.
You need to eat a lot.
Why won't you escort me home?
You can't see, so you don't know where you live.
Eat.
- Please let me out.
- Go on, eat.
What's this?
- I know...
- So what?
You were to spread pigeon poison on the roof.
- They shit on my backyard.
- Mr Holtrum...
I gave you that poison to use.
You live in the attic, I have to climb all these stairs.
I'll do it.
But be careful. Wear gloves. In case you get poisoned yourself.
Excuse me.
Mended my watch?
I can see you haven't even opened it...
- What are you doing?
- Can't you see?
Measuring.
Why?
A questionnaire.
Typical measurements.
Raise your arms.
Show me your identity card.
- Why?
- I need the number.
You can copy it out of the register.
So you don't have one?
I'll look for it and bring it downstairs.
You have a day for the search.
I want it found by tomorrow.
By tomorrow. Is that clear, Mr Pernat?
- I didn't collect it.
- You got a pass.
I claimed only my clothes.
Lost identity cards are not our department.
I collected my clothes. I must have left the card behind.
Your name?
- Ashamed of it? - You know my name.
You're not feeling well.
I'm sorry.
- So what is your name?
- Pernat.
- Have you changed your name?
- No.
When you were last here, you had a different name.
You're mistaken.
And you now want a card in the name of Pernat?
Why are you asking for a card in a name that is not your own?
But you questioned me and let me go. I'd like that identity card back.
We talked for several hours, your identity being one of the subjects, but we arrived at no constructive conclusions.
I'm afraid your name is absent from the register of the living and the dead.
Anything else?
I must have an identity card, without one I don't exist.
That's not my business.
My business is criminals.
In any case, I'm through for the day.
May I leave?
As easily as you came in.
You are a free man.
Out you go.
There you are.
I was looking for you! I told you that doctors were murderers.
You didn't believe me and you still don't!
It's my regular prayer:
Doctors kill people.
Some dummy or other... has only to bemoan his fate on the stage and everyone starts weeping.
Because sob stuff plays on the riff-raff's feelings.
You see that guy?
Guess what he'd like to do most? Shove a stick up my ass like a puppet and shake me from side to side, left, right!
Why do people flock to the theatre so eagerly?
For the hearts and flowers, for proof that they are more sincere and human than the characters on stage!
Give this to my father.
- What is it? - Our blood.
- That should do the trick.
- "Our"?
His blood, but flowing in my veins.
I don't want it and I'm giving it back to him.
You need a bandage on that.
I've worked it out, to the tiniest inflection.
He must take all this blood and be buried with it.
Only schmaltz can still get through to stiffs like him!
See he gets this, I beg you!
- Very well.
- Thank you.
- You promise?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Stiffs...
Never leave the key in the lock or they may trap you, my son.
I've come as I promised.
Is it this book?
You read it thousand times. You should know.
- I should?
- Yes.
It contains everything. Every moment, every occurrence.
It's nice of you. Very nice of you to be making the cover for my book.
But it's a book you need more than I do.
It contains answers which you alone need.
What does this book reveal?
- The purpose.
- I don't understand.
Many books have described how man was created but there are none which have said why, for what purpose.
- And the answer's here?
- Yes, but only for you.
Can there be a book which has answers only for me?
They're here to be found by anyone using the right vowels.
If one can't understand that, one is a fool.
Right?
Look!
I kneel before you. So in the end you're the angel and I'm the devil.
Why pick on him?
- Because he has a self of his own?
- A society of individualists like him is doomed! It can only disintegrate!
- Individuality threatens society?
- What are we talking about?
- About us!
- Don't exaggerate.
Pernat has hardly suffered. His activeness is rising.
Any further increase in awareness will make him rebel.
Rebel.
Is there anything you need?
Leave me alone.
It's you?
- Help me. - How?
What can I do for you?
Take me.
Let's go to the movies. Where's the nearest cinema?
- Cinema?
- Do you feel like going?
Okay. I'll show you the way.
- I'm sorry you found me crying.
- It's so human.
Well now, shall we go to the movies?
Yes, that will be best.
Your father hates you and your brother. Why?
- Simply because we're both humans.
- But his children.
I'm defective.
Or do you find me attractive?
He requires perfection. He thinks we're too unlike him.
Can anyone set himself up as a model?
I know that he would like to look like you.
I'm his ideal type?
No, he despises you for your goodness.
It's only your body he envies. He says you have the look of a cultured man.
He's like to create an improved version of himself.
But he spawns the likes of me, instead of, the masterpieces he craves.
He's mad. He wants to create life.
That oven is everything to him, can't you see?
What are you trying to say?
Never mind.
Do you find me attractive?
Yes indeed!
- No one's ever stood me a movie!
- We don't have to go back.
- Stay in a cinema forever?
- This is no cinema.
It is!
It's a movie!
Look around you!
People!
- People!
- You believe they really exist?
Can't you see?
Can't you hear?
Let's go over there and join them.
Cut!
It's all make - believe!
Rozyna!
Where are you?
- Quiet!
- Quiet!
- This is the wrong crowd.
- The other one got lost.
What do you mean, "the other crowd got lost"?
Find it.
This one really is all wrong.
I can try.
- I'm looking for a girl, red-haired.
- We haven't any.
We were here, the crowd was cheering.
You mean, you come with that crowd on the screen?
It's only a film clip!
- So it is a movie?
- Hell no! This is television.
This girl had red hair...
Movies, girls... Trying to convert me? No.
I'm looking for a girl. Rozyna...
- Just a second!
- That second clip's vanished.
You haven't seen her?
Look, I've lost a crowd, got it?
Which bit of footage did you escape from?
Get out of here. I'm working.
So, what do we do?
Has a girl with red hair passed this way?
Is something the matter with you?
You want to help me?
I could fetch a doctor.
That's not what I mean.
If you want to help me, hand me my hat.
It's too far away for me to reach.
That's the only thing I can do for you?
The only thing?
It's what I need most.
This hat?
Where would I would be without it?
Do I get it back?
You see. I feel better already.
You don't wear a hat. That frontal sinuses, baldness...
Who are you?
Background's important, but must we always go back to square one?
I'm the foreman. A foreman of slumber land.
This girl had red hair. Have you seen her?
You're delirious.
Red hair indeed!
When you're bald!
Look after your head.
My father might need me.
Right now he's finishing his book.
So he says. That book's empty, Miriam. You know it's a pipe-dream.
You fret over me so...
What did your father do when he was younger?
Before my mother died?
He was a clerk in a record office.
He recorded deaths and births.
- You can't live only for your father.
- He's unimportant.
What matters to me are unexpected gifts.
- I take after my mother.
- When did she die?
Long ago.
She was engaged to Holtrum. Your Mother?
!
Nothing came of it, luckily.
He's a sad case.
He wasn't always.
I used to go and play with him when I was little.
He gave me a ring.
Don't worry about me. I'm happy here.
I want to leave this place. With you.
Later my mother came to hate him.
He despised her for falling in love with him.
But now, when his son has lost his wits...
Let's leave.
Let's get away as far as we can!
Do you believe that one's destiny can be changed?
But you believe in pipe-dreams!
That book, those gifts - that's all they are!
- Give me your hand.
- Why?
I want to see your lifeline, your future.
I can read palms.
That's another of your illusions.
- You're afraid?
- Nonsense!
In that case give me your hand!
Let's go.
Why?
I really am very happy here.
This is for me?
Specially for me?
It was yours and it still is yours.
You can take it.
- You mean it?
- It's your turn today.
You're not alone. You can choose.
So I have freedom of choice?
You can think you have.
Like a rat in a maze.
Like an ant that belongs to the ant-hill.
Your results have been a let-down.
This Pernat has proved a mistake, your mistake.
- How can you tell?
- The progress reports.
- They were my reports.
- Your materials are to be turned in to these gentlemen.
The consequences of discontinuing this program...
Allow me to judge the consequences of my decisions.
Do you think you're the only team working on this program?
- Why can't I work with them then?
A human being can still be made of Pernat.
We have a new project for you: Breeding carps.
What will become of Pernat?
Who is Pernat?
Don't you worry about that.
The authorized persons will find the right solution.
Mr Pernat! Come downstairs quickly!
I had a message for you, but I've clean forgotten it.
Mr Holtrum will be angry.
Did you mend the watch properly?
He'll be angry with me.
Mr Holtrum!
I've brought... Where are you?
Mr Holtrum, your son asked me...
"... he was sitting on the floor, holding a bottle with a dark liquid. Next to him laid the deceased".
Does that tally with the statement? Yes.
"It has been established that the liquid is blood of the same group as the blood of the deceased".
- It was not his blood.
- Look, I have the lab report here.
You murdered a man for a mere drop of blood?
I've seen some perverts in my time...
Or are you perhaps a blood donor?
It was his son's blood.
Don't act the religious maniac.
Save it for the trial.
I'm sure that you are probably insane.
Holtrum had no son.
Do you refuse to testify?
Here's how it was.
You went in armed with your chisel and stuck it in his throat.
A big man like him must have been a long time dying.
You then filled the bottle and stole his watch. Why the hell did you stole the watch? That will I never understand.
- I did none of that.
- Ok, so this is your story:
You went in with his watch and blood in the bottle and found him dead?
- Yes.
- And sat down beside him?
- First I closed his eyes.
- Literally? - Yes.
- Why?
- It's what you do to the dead.
So when you see a murdered man you first move is to close his eyes?
He seemed to be staring at me. I couldn't bear it.
But you could bear to murder him and watch his blood flowing into your bottle?
Don't worry. I shan't be in the way. I'm leaving soon.
- Did they torture you?
- No.
I confessed and signed a statement.
- You confessed?
- Why be awkward?
You'll probably be released after 48 hours.
That depends.
What are you supposed to have done?
A sex killing.
You're kidding.
You'll be released tomorrow for sure.
I haven't told you the whole truth. You're the last person I'll ever talk to.
Tomorrow I'm going for the chop.
- Want some?
- Thanks, but I'm dieting.
In any case I have to be on an empty stomach.
There's no justice. You've been victimized.
It's a disease, you mean?
You're lying to me.
Nevertheless it's true.
My only next stop is the grave.
So this is a death row?
Don't let it worry you. The danger lies elsewhere.
But this is a hospital.
You still have a lot to look forward to.
- Who are you?
- Does it matter?
A saint perhaps, a criminal...
Tomorrow I'll be a new and better man.
Right now I'm a prisoner.
Can't you be clearer than that?
You interest me.
At present they're better at it, more precise...
I knew at once that of the two of us I'm a goner.
Been inside long?
Several years.
Do you want to know how it was?
- How what was?
- With that girl.
She had a lot of dolls and very fair hair. And a doll is what she served me as.
I did exactly what children do with dolls.
Such children may be suspected of having vicious instincts, but show me the child who never ripped a doll open.
- What was her name?
- Miriam...
Yes, I think it was Miriam.
I realize how awful it must be to sleep with a man like me.
REPOSITORY
- Depositing or claiming?
- I'm leaving.
Let's have the tag.
Wait there.
Without tags there would be chaos and we can't have that.
Without tags anyone could come here and help himself.
Here you are.
You were right. They were not your things.
Someone goofed.
You still remember that?
Different numbers, but the same names.
That's very rare.
So now I check only the numbers.
It was you who issued my things?
Did the switch make all that difference?
Close the door.
Do you still have my old things?
What things?
You deposited this coat and it's the one I'm returning!
The number tallies and the name tallies.
If you don't like it, take it off, go back, where you came from and lodge your complaint there.
I'm sorry.
They're the right things after all.
I'll braid your hair with a rosy-red ribbon.
Won't that be nice? You'll have ribbons, you'll be fed...
You're a good man. You won't hurt my children?
You're leaving, aren't you?
No!
They're my children!
Be assured! Don't be fooled by slanderous whispers, by lies and old wives' tales!
Be assured! Don't believe any of these fraudulent stories!
Any hocus-pocus information!
The idea that biological experiments on people have been used in a post-nuclear humanity reconstruction program is absolute rubbish, a lie,
...a mumbo-jumbo, affront to common sense.
Take my word for it.
What's wrong?
I'm worried about you.
I've been trapped here for more than ten years.
You've only just arrived and may be stuck even longer.
Maybe my luck will be better than yours.
I was optimistic once, too, but I'm still here now.
I don't want you to end up like me.
Uncle, you're so nice.
People up above are really hypocritical.
If everyone was like you, I wouldn't be stuck here now.
Yeah, you're right! I've been here a long time, but you're new.
I hope you can free yourself eventually.
Uncle, are you all right?
I'm fine. This hole's getting bigger and the draught is giving me a cold.
After I've left, you can have my place.
Someone's coming.
- It's a fat guy.
- He's mine.
- Uncle, you can't take him.
- Why not? - He'll get me out of here.
- You're just like all the rest.
No, I'm not. I'm just being realistic.
- You old git!
- Young man, calm down.
Calm down? ! I don't want to be like you and waste more time here.
Even here there is order. Don't start an internal conflict.
- May the best man win.
- Fine!
Leave me some, you old git!
That was really scary!
- You scared me!
- You scared me!
- A nightmare?
- How did you know? Why else would you be screaming like that?
I dreamt about two ghosts who must have been mad.
They wouldn't stop chasing me.
It was just a dream. You're always boasting about how brave you are.
Of course!
My bravery is known far and wide.
- The spirits will haunt you. - Why?
The poorer you are, the more likely you are to be haunted.
You'll be the one that's haunted.
Being chased by ghosts is still better than sleeping with you.
- This cloth...
- It looks good on me, doesn't it?
- Where did you get it from?
- I bought it myself.
It must have cost a fortune.
I didn't buy it with your money!
You didn't? ! Whose money was it then?
- My...my money.
You haven't got much money!
I save up a little every day, and it gradually mounts up!
Save up a little every day? !
It's time you went to work.
The Ghost Festival is on today, Mr Tam gave me a day off.
- Are you coming out for breakfast?
It's up to you. See you later.
Ah Dooh?
Here so early! Eat whatever you want.
Bold Cheung, you're bold by name and bold by nature.
That's very true! Everyone here knows I'm no coward!
I don't think you're that wonderful.
You're just a show-off!
I know this Western game which foreigners are scared of.
It even scares foreigners?
Tell me how to play it.
It's called Peel-Apple. You only need...
I thought it was something new.
- He's not done yet, let him finish.
- OK, carry on.
At midnight, you get an apple, then you light a candle and look in the mirror.
You have to peel the apple in one go, without breaking the skin.
- Once you have finished...
- What happens?
- ..you'll get whatever you want.
- Are you serious?
What happens if it breaks?
Ifthat happens, you'll experience something really terrifying.
- Bullshit! I don't believe it.
Are you brave enough to have a go?
Sure, as long as one ofyou buys my breakfast.
OK, I'll pay for your breakfast tomorrow.
Come to my place tonight.
OK, help yourself.
Someone else is paying.
Waitress, one more setting here.
There's a free breakfast tomorrow.
Don't forget to come.
Now!
I broke the skin.
Something really bad is going to happen to me.
Come here, come here.
Why is she wearing men's shoes?
That mole looks very familiar.
It must be Ah Dooh.
I'll teach him a lesson.
Come out, come out! Hurry up!
I'm coming!
How dare you make fun of me!
I'll beat you up right now.
- It was a joke.
- You scared the shit out of me.
That's impossible! You're fearless!
Stop it!
He knows!
He knows it's a joke.
Stop that.
- How does he know?
- So you teamed up against me? That's enough.
You light the candles.
We didn't mean to embarrass you.
You're very bold, no question.
You lit the candles.
Let's get out of here!
- How did you come out ofthe mirror?
- That's easy. Come with me.
The mirror is movable, you can see me if I slide it down.
You can't see me when I push it up again.
I might be afraid of real ghosts, but notjoke ones like this.
Ifyou ever try that again, I'll...
Please...
I'm really sorry.
You really live up to your reputation.
- You really... - I've accepted your apologies.
I'd better go now.
Hey, no more jokes.
Are you trying to scare me again? You're making me angry!
Where is he?
He's winding me up!
Where are they?
Ah Mo!
Ah Pang!
What's this?
Cheung!
Yes, Mr Tam?
Remember, don't tell anyone where I'm going.
Don't worry, Mr Tam.
I'm not stupid.
You've already told me. I wouldn't forget your orders.
I'm rich and well respected.
I'm even running for mayor.
If people knew what I was doing, my reputation would be ruined.
Yeah, it would ruin your reputation.
- Be smart.
I won't forget you. - OK.
I really don't get it, Mr Tam. You're so wealthy.
You can have any girl you want. Is it worth all this trouble?
But I'm a squire, and in my position I have to be discreet.
And besides, I love the danger of it.
I know what you mean.
Here we are.
Careful, Mr Tam.
I'll be back to get you once the incense is finished.
Mr Tam, this way.
This sweet tofu is so good.
A bowl oftofu, please! - No problem.
You're late today.
- I was with Mr Tam.
Hurry up! The boss is waiting for you.
Thanks, Uncle Fok.
- Thanks.
- Hurry up.
I'm surprised so many ofyou young people are doing thatjob.
- What's wrong with it?
- It's easy and we get lots oftips.
- You get lots oftips.
- Let me tell you a story.
- Hey, woman!
- What do you want?
Go and buy me some sugar.
- And what if I eat it coming home?
- I don't care.
Years ago there was this guy who had a similarjob to yours.
He had a cart with him, and went to work every day. He had a very good life.
While you guys would be here having lunch, he would be off flirting with the ladies.
But one day, he left work early. He got back home and noticed...
- Guess what his wife was doing?
- What was she doing?
- Making love.
So he quit his job, and together with his wife he started selling sweet tofu.
That's a true story!
You bastard! You're telling them our story.
I cheated on you. You should be ashamed ofyourself!
I didn't say you cheated on me, I said you were making love.
Making love with someone else is the same as accusing me of cheating.
- I wouldn't dare say that! - Here's the money!
- Just wait till I get you home! - Stop this messing.
Leave me alone.
- Good stuff! - Yeah, yeah.
- Well?
- You Peeping Toms. Get lost!
Open the door!
Be careful.
- Where is he?
- Who?
The bastard who was in bed with you! The bastard who was in bed with me?
You're saying I was cheating on you!
- Look at the bed yourself! Go on!
- I did see someone here.
Oh, I see... you're not happy with me, and you're looking for excuses to divorce me.
Go on, then, divorce me!
- Write up the divorce papers, then!
You think you're so wonderful, that you are a great catch!
I've been working hard, and I was just taking a nap.
You even wanted to kill me with that knife.
Kill me! Kill me!
You bastard! Go on, kill me!
- Whose shoe is this?
- It's yours.
It's too big for me.
Where's the other one?
Well, precisely, it's too big, so I've taken it back.
- It's an old shoe.
- You always buy old shoes.
Look at them! You just disgraced me in front of all these people!
I don't want to live any longer!
- Kill me! Kill me!
- Honey, please stop it!
I'm late!
Honey, it's all my fault.
I have to get back to work now.
You can'tjust leave like this.
Mind your own business.
Go away!
This must belong to her lover.
You and your wife shouldn't argue like that.
Are you looking for me, my lord?
You've had enough of Cheung's wife, haven't you?
No, but he nearly caught me red-handed today.
Didn't you send someone to keep an eye on him?
I don't know what got into him today.
He suddenly came back home and checked on his wife.
- Did he see you?
- No!
Otherwise I'd be dead now.
But he found the shoe I left behind.
That's not a problem, it doesn't prove anything.
If he threatens his wife, she could still tell him everything.
If it was anybody else, it would be hard to say, but I'm sure Cheung's wife won't breathe a word.
I hope not.
- I'm still worried.
- My lord, you mean...?
Get rid of Cheung!
But it has to be a clean job, otherwise we might end up in big trouble.
Don't forget Cheung's kung fu is very good.
That's right.
A friend of mine knows witchcraft.
- Witchcraft?
- Yes, that's it.
Does it work?
If it didn't, it wouldn't be so popular here.
- What's his name?
- Chin Hoi.
He'll do anything for money.
Master Chin, the deal...
- I've thought it over.
- So? I'll do it.
- But... - But what?
I'll need to set up an altar at your place.
- It's for your own safety.
I'll leave everything to you.
"Master Chin's Residence"
Hi, brother.
This is Mr Lau - my colleague.
- I'd better be going now.
- This way.
What can I do for you?
There's this rich man who feels threatened by someone.
And he wants to be rid ofthis person.
Kill him?
No need to get our hands dirty, all we need is an altar.
But our skills are for saving lives.
We've saved so many lives, it's no harm to take just one.
Remember the rules of our sect. One, you must not be greedy.
Two, you must not kill. Three, you must not insult our god.
- You must not behave badly.
But there's nothing better than money.
And our teacher died a long time ago.
- Are you going to help me or not?
I'm afraid not.
Fair enough.
But promise not to tell anyone.
Otherwise I will punish you severely.
- Coward! - Master, he...
There's Bold Cheung.
You can go now.
Change your clothes first.
Hurry up!
- I'm sorry.
- You're Bold Cheung, aren't you? - You are...
- I'm Fa Kau.
- Fa Kau? ! That's me.
- We used to drink together.
Are you still as bold as you used to be?
If I claim I'm the boldest man here, no one would dare challenge me.
- I don't think so.
- That's up to you.
- Let's wager ten taels of silver.
- Ten taels? - Correct!
- Tell me more!
It's yours ifyou stay one night at the Temple.
- Stay one night at the Temple?
- Yes, that's all you have to do.
It's a deal.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- My friend...
- Did we also use to drink together?
- No!
- That's OK, then.
Do you know where the Temple is?
Turn left once you're out ofthe forest.
Why is he going there, too?
What are you going to do there?
- To collect a corpse.
- What corpse?
A fat guy's going to spend the night there.
He's going to die and I must collect his corpse. I'm going to check the place out first.
- Am I fat?
- You're enormous!
I'm the fat guy.
You're doomed!
Doomed? Did Fa Kau send you?
I don't know him.
- My colleague said you'd die.
- Who's your colleague?
- He's a master ofwitchcraft.
- Witchcraft is magic, isn't it?
I don't believe it... Unless you could produce money out ofthin air?
You're asking too much.
I can produce phony money, though.
- Show me, then.
- Hold this.
Watch this!
One, two, three, four, five!
Change!
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!
That's great!
But can you save my life?
- Do you believe me now?
- Of course, I believe you!
OK, I'll tell you what to do.
Once you arrive at the Temple, wait until it gets dark.
Nothing will happen before 1 :00am. At 2:00am, you must climb onto the roof.
And you must keep quiet, no matter what!
It'll be quiet at 3:00am.
But at 4:00am...
- What'll happen?
- You must lie underneath a coffin.
What about at 5:00am?
The sun comes out at 5:00am, and then you'll be fine.
Right. Let's go.
- I'm not going now.
- Why?
You're not going to die, so there's no need for me to be there.
- I forgot to ask your name.
- My name's Tsui, I live in Kau Li.
Remember what I just said.
I'll remember, don't worry about that.
You'd better get it right.
Bold Cheung, what's the matter with you?
- Quick, let's go. It's getting dark. - All right, all right.
You can go in now.
Go on!
It doesn't get dark for a while.
I'll find a place to sleep.
Master, this is ready.
- Get the light. - Yes, sir.
Time to get moving.
I can't find him.
It's fine.
Water... Water...
- All gone. - Gone.
Master Chin, are you OK?
Shit! The sun's up.
Go back!
Bold Cheung.
'He must be dead!
'
Bold Cheung. Let's have one more wager.
What about 50 taels for spending another night there?
- 50 taels? - That's right. 50 taels!
Great, it's a deal.
You said it.
I'm doomed.
I'm going to die tonight.
That's it.
It depends on your wit and luck.
- What do you mean?
- When are you going to meet them?
- At 6:00pm.
- What time is it now? - 4:00pm.
- There's still time.
Go and get fifty eggs, four dog's legs and some dog's blood.
- They must be chicken eggs.
Hello... Fifty eggs, please. I'll be right back.
- Chicken eggs. - OK.
You can pick them up later.
Ten.
Twenty.
Thirty.
Forty.
Oh, no. I haven't got fifty.
"Duck Eggs"
Now, I have fifty.
"Abattoir"
- Are they ready?
- They're ready.
Take all the stuffto the Temple.
Everything's ready! - OK.
- What's next?
Where should I sleep tonight?
On top ofthe coffin.
Are you scared?
- No...just a little.
- You'll be fine.
When you're lying on the coffin, you must have the eggs with you.
At 2:00am you'll hear noises from the coffin.
Throw an egg into the coffin when it opens.
Then the coffin will close.
If it opens again, throw another egg in.
By the time you've used up all 50 eggs, the sun will be up.
Ifthe eggs fail to keep the coffin closed, throw the dog's blood and legs onto the corpse.
That's better. Then the corpse won't be able to hurt you.
That's horrible!
I'm leaving tonight.
- You should quit gambling.
- Where are you going?
You'll find me at the Man Fok Cemetery.
Horrible! Horrible!
I'm going to bed.
You stay here.
OK.
Sleep well.
What happened?
I don't get it.
Master, are you all right?
Piss off!
Water.
- Water...
- That's all.
What's going on here?
What should we do, then?
- Will it work?
- It's never failed!
- That was quick, Mr Tam.
- I'm a bit under the weather.
You need to take care.
You can go after you've taken me home.
Thanks, Mr Tam.
'l've got you this time.'
What happened to my house?
Sweetheart! Sweetheart...!
Make way!
Inspector, I was just coming for you.
No, you were trying to escape.
I think my wife may have been murdered.
She has been murdered!
Where's her body?
- I don't know. - So you've destroyed the evidence?
- No!
- Can you prove it?
- Have you got an alibi?
- I was...
Carry on!
I was eating tofu at Uncle Fok's. - Bring Uncle Fok.
- Yes, sir.
Come here.
- Put it there.
- Are they the same? - Exactly the same!
- These must be yours as well.
- I suppose so.
You killed your wife and took the body into the kitchen.
But you couldn't hide it under the stove.
So you carried the body out through the window.
- Why did you kill your wife?
Love, hate or money?
Which one?
- No, I didn't do it.
- We've got a witness.
- You first.
- You first. Speak up.
Inspector, this couple were always fighting.
He even threatened his wife with a knife.
And...
That's enough. You can go now.
- Did you hear what they said?
- I...
Uncle Fok's here.
- But he just had a stroke.
- That's your last hope.
Can you tell the lnspector I ate your tofu today?
How could you have a stroke at a time like this?
Tell him! Or I'll be doomed!
Uncle Fok!
- Stop interfering with the witness!
- I didn't.
Ifyou can't talk, then write.
Bring some paper!
Just write yes or no on the paper.
Yes. Yes...
He wrote "no".
What you have got to say?
Take him away!
I'm innocent!
Mr Tam.
- Mr Lau.
- Why did you murder your wife?
I'm innocent, Mr Tam.
I was waiting for you when she died.
I haven't told anybody.
Please get me out of here, Mr Tam.
We don't think you killed her.
Mr Tam is doing his best to help you.
I've spent a lot of money on you because ofthis case.
- Just be patient and wait...
- ..to go to hell.
- Thank you very much, Mr Tam.
- We'd better be going now.
- Let me see you out.
- No need for that.
Then I'll say goodbye. See you, Mr Tam.
What a big meal!
Mr Tam must have spent a lot on this.
You'd better enjoy that.
You won't get any tomorrow.
- Are you going to free me tomorrow?
- Free you! ln a way, yes.
What do you mean?
Your head will be freed from your body. You'll be beheaded tomorrow.
Do you understand?
Eat your meal!
It must be a mistake.
Did you send the food to the wrong cell?
It's not the wrong cell. Eat your food.
But Mr Tam has spent lots of money on me.
It must be a mistake.
I'll eat your food!
That's more like it!
- Can we have some, please?
It hurts!
It hurts!
It's killing me!
He's got an upset stomach.
Let him die here.
It'll save us from having to go and collect his body tomorrow.
- He's still hungry!
- Let's give him something else.
You're breaking the plates.
Please, don't hit me!
They are all like that.
He needs a good beating.
Please don't hit me!
Please! Stop it!
He was asking for that. Damn it.
We'll leave them to it.
We finish early tonight.
- Are we going out? - We'll talk about it later.
I didn't mean to break your coffin.
Both of us are having bad luck! This is a cheap coffin.
If I had money, I'd get you a better one.
I'm so sorry!
Where can I sleep?
Can you lend me some ofyour wood?
I'll leave as soon as the sun comes up.
I'm so sorry!
- How did he escape?
- How do I know?
- Sorry to have bothered you.
- Let's get him!
Where is he?
I can't see him.
'He must be under my influence.
He copies whatever I do.'
You're too smart, I can't handle you!
'Just wait until the sun's up!
'l'm between the devil and the deep blue sea.'
It's Bold Cheung!
- He's coming this way.
- Now I'll get him.
- He's coming! - He's coming!
Give me the knives!
Help!
Hurry up. Hurry up!
- Get him off!
Burn him!
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Get him!
Not again!
Bold Cheung!
What are you doing here?
The law is after me!
Can you hide me?
They'll be here soon!
Follow me!
- What are you doing?
In the coffin?
! There's...
Nothing. Hurry up!
Get in.
Hurry up!
This way!
Anyone in?
Can't you see me sitting here?
- Have you seen anyone come in here?
- Where is he?
- Right beside me!
- I mean before we arrived.
- Then, no.
- Spread out. - Yes, sir!
- Hello?
We can't find him.
Open the third coffin.
- I think you'd better go yourself.
He died a long time ago. That corpse is rotting away.
It really stinks.
Think about it.
It really stinks!
Are you sure? !
- That's enough.
- Ifyou see this man, let me know.
Let's go.
You can come out now.
- They've gone? - Yes.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
What about staying here as my assistant?
That would be great!
Thanks a lot.
Here you are.
See you.
- Did you kill your wife?
- No, I didn't!
- Do you know who did?
- Yes, I do.
- The owner ofthis shoe!
- Who is that? !
Who?
- I don't know.
- Nonsense!
- Let's find a place to eat.
- OK, I'm starving!
- What kind oftea would you like?
This restaurant does good tea and good food as well.
This place is famous for its ribs and rice.
- Want some? - Yeah! - Waiter!
- Two bowls of ribs and rice. - OK!
"Bold Cheung, Born May, 1876"
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.
My food!
What are you doing?
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.
What's going on?
What's going on? Maybe he's...
It's nothing to do with me!
Stop!
I'm fine now!
You'd better not...
- You're no colleague of mine.
- You said it.
Don't get in my way!
But there's no need to kill him.
I've been paid to do it.
- Bugger off!
You'd better let him off, or...
I'll let him off. I will!
I'm leaving. You...
You'd better watch out.
Date of birth.
- Sorry. - Sorry.
- He messed up the whole place. - Get lost!
Bold Cheung, you can't get away this time.
- I told you I didn't kill my wife.
- Get him. Kill him ifyou have to.
It doesn't matter how!
Kill him!
Useless! Step aside!
What are you doing?
- What's going on?
- What are you waiting for? Let's go!
What has got into you?
- Who knows your date of birth?
- Only my wife and Mr Tam.
- Mr Tam? - Yeah.
- Has he got an adviser called Lau?
- Yes, how did you know?
It must be your boss who's been trying to kill you.
Mr Tam. It can't be.
He's treated me so well, why would he kill me?
You can'tjudge a book by its cover.
If it wasn't him, how has my colleague got your date of birth?
- What should we do?
- Get changed and then find Mr Tam.
We should get the answer from him. Let's go.
What are we doing here?
- You're going to have a wash.
- Have a wash here? !
You're going to take a good long bath.
I want my student to have a clean body.
- Your student? !
- That's right. My colleague is more skilled than me and I can't always protect you.
I don't want you to get killed.
You should have taught me before, then!
But you may not be able to have children.
Hold it.
We're running out oftime.
Hurry up. Hurry up!
Is it going to work, Master Chin?
Don't worry, Mr Tam. I will kill him.
Honey...
Why did you come out ofyour room?
I want to see how Bold Cheung's going to die.
He won't survive. Go back to your room.
- Go back to your room.
- It's none ofyour business!
I'll shut up...
Master, it's about time.
Light the candles!
Heaven and Earth be my guide...
Let the sacred light be my protector...
I see and hear nothing...
Paper is your face, paper is your body.
The sacred light will breathe life into your body.
You can hear sounds from both Heaven and Hell.
Your scream will scare the devil off.
I command the gods to appear.
Please don't move!
You've painted his body, haven't you?
Master, we're on the same side now.
Now we're on the same side.
- What was that for?
- A wizard can't wear good clothes.
And he must know how to stamp on the ground.
Stamp on the ground?
To get power from the gods and the demons.
- What are you doing?
- I can't do it.
It takes at least 49 days. 49 days?
I haven't got that much time.
Put it on.
Is it knife-proof? No.
But it may help you survive.
Master, here comes more trouble.
From one o'clock to twelve o'clock, be gone!
The wooden sword!
All the demons are under my control.
I command the gods to appear!
- Where are you setting up the altar?
- Longevity Inn.
Longevity Inn.
- You've succeeded, right?
- I was foiled by my colleague.
- They're coming here.
- Here?
What are we going to do?
Tell your men to raise the altar!
- Did you hear that?
Raise the altar. - Yes, sir.
Let's get out of here.
Go inside and you'll be paid.
- Master Chin?
- They are helpless now. Don't worry.
Show me your face!
Mr Tam!
It really was you!
- Bold Cheung.
- Stay cool!
- That altar is very high.
- You think so?
Do you remember what our teacher used to say? When two opponents are matched in strength, the one with the higher altar will win.
How could I forget our teacher's words?
- You're dead. - We'll see.
Bold Cheung.
Raise the altar. - Raise the altar!
My altar's not so low now, is it?
- Light the candles!
The Five Thunders Palm?
Bold Cheung.
Bold Cheung.
He's invoking the spirits!
Spirits, I invoke you in the name ofthe gods!
The Dragon Slayer on my left! The Tiger Fighter on my right!
Answer my prayer! Grant my wish!
Spirits, I invoke you in the name ofthe gods!
The Monkey God be on my side!
Answer my prayer! Grant my wish!
The red slip!
The sound ofthe drum will shake the world!
Give me the strength of all wizards!
Help me to destroy all demons!
Grant my wishes!
The smell of incense will reach the sky!
He who wears a red slip, he who carries a spear, is the reincarnation ofthe War God!
Grant my wishes!
Are you all right, Mr Tam?
I'll...
'Does that shoe really belong to Mr Tam? ' Bold Cheung, throw the shoe!
Not this one, the one on your back!
What's happening to my foot?
Please....
Master! Master!
Are you all right?
That was a very nasty fall.
Honey...
- Are you all right?
- Sweetheart? !
- I'm really scared!
- Your boss was trying to rape me.
- I know...
I know you're lying!
Bitch!
- What's that?
- What's what?
I heard something.
I don't hear anything.
Maybe it's my boyfriend.
Hey, come on.
That did it.
What you going to do?
You just wait here.
And if it's him, I'm going to break his neck.
Don't hurt him, Don.
Please?
Don?
Don, is that you?
Please, answer me, Don.
I'm not letting you back in.
Come on, Don. Don't play games with me.
Don?
Donnie?
Donnie?
I can't take this anymore.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Is that you, Ruthie?
Is somebody there?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Where have you been?
This is great.
Somebody's following me.
Will you watch the movie?
But when I was down in the bathroom...
- Come on.
- No.
I really don't like this. Can we go home?
She's going to get it.
OK, you can look now.
You OK, Marie?
You still want to go home?
Marie?
Marie?
Oh, God.
Weapon went right through the vertebrae... severed the spinal cord, and pierced the heart.
The guy's an animal.
The knife went right through the chair.
Well, that shouldn't be too hard to do.
Gamble's here, Frank.
Are you kidding?
Back of those chairs are metal.
Len, how are you?
This better be good, Frank.
Well, I just thought you might like to see this one.
Couldn't it wait till morning? Yeah.
Yeah, it could've.
But I don't think you could've.
Come on.
Come on.
She just told me the whole story.
All right. Can we hear it again, sweetheart?
She came back from the bathroom... and she said something about someone following her.
But I thought she was imagining it... that the movie, you know, it got to her.
Maybe if we'd have left... she'd still be alive.
Frank, come here.
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Frank, why'd you get me out of bed for this one?
She was getting married, Len.
Next week.
I bet it's him.
Now, wait, wait.
Don't jump to any conclusions.
I mean, it might be a coincidence.
- Coincidence?
- Yeah.
No, Frank.
He's back.
He's giving me a second chance.
He's giving me a second chance.
What do you call that?
Hey, this is "Doll of Manhattan."
Yeah? I'm putting all my trust in you.
You like it?
You look like the Statue of Liberty.
What's your favorite song?
Come on and tell me.
I'll play it.
Well, it's a big day. Big day for you, Len.
What are you doing here?
Look, I think you should leave.
Ray, listen, I'm sorry things worked out the way they did.
I didn't plan any of this.
It just happened, OK?
Now, come on. Would you leave, please?
Ray?
Ray, come on. Get...
Ray...
- Hey, Amy.
- Yeah?
You going to miss me?
Oh, probably not.
Hey, I was only kidding.
Of course I'm going to miss you.
I love you.
You're always so serious.
Are you going to miss me?
- Sure.
- Yeah?
Hey, while I'm away, do you think you could... pick up that couch I wanted for the living room?
Oh, it's so exciting.
Gosh, you go away for a bachelor's weekend... and I get to pick out furniture.
Come on, watch your step, you guys.
Just what are you going to do this weekend?
Well, I don't know.
I mean, Joyce and Nancy are sleeping over.
OK, you ready to sing that song I taught you?
Yeah.
Don't let me catch that Marvin hanging around...
- or I'll...
- What?
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Stepped on a turtle and down came her girdle
Here comes the bride, all dressed in white
Stepped on a turtle and down came her girdle
What's wrong with you guys?
I can't count on you for anything.
Hey, Bernie!
- How are you?
- Hi. How was it?
OK.
We had a good time.
How's everything?
- OK.
- Fine.
What'd you think of my present?
Don't we get money?
A stack of ones at the wedding.
Hey, private!
Come on.
- Hi there.
- All right.
Hottest pornos in town.
And we pick up the women on the way.
- Mary?
- And Evelyn and Ginny.
- All right!
- It's gonna be good.
Hey, you guys. What's going on down there?
Come on, let's get going.
I want to get there before dark.
All right.
Come here.
Have a good time up there, OK?
- I'll try. - Yeah?
Don't drink too much beer.
You know what it does to you.
Bye.
Watch out for lions and tigers and bears.
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Be good.
Bernie, there really aren't any bears up there, are there?
Sometimes.
How can they have a good time without us up there?
Let me count the ways.
If there's a woman up there, Tommy will find her.
He's got a sixth sense about that.
All men have that sense.
It's the only sense they got.
All right, let's go through it one more time.
It's like I've been telling you. We were sitting there watching the movie... and this chick, she just started screaming.
Everybody was screaming.
You didn't see anybody leave the theater?
No.
Uh-uh.
You're sure?
I was watching the movie, man.
How about you?
I... I had my eyes closed.
All right, you can go.
Look, I'm sorry we couldn't be any help.
I hope you catch him.
Yeah.
Was that the last of them?
One, two, three, four.
Up, two, three, four.
Stretch, two, three, four.
Up, two, three, four.
Over, two, three, four.
Up, two, three, four.
Down, two, three, four.
What time is it?
Quarter to 1:00.
Oh, thank God.
Only fifteen more minutes.
Quit dogging it, Joyce.
Sometimes I think I'm a masochist.
It's good for you.
It relieves frustrations.
I prefer sex.
Come on, girls. No talking.
OK, legs off the bar.
Fifth position. Ready, and...
Kick, plié, kick, plié.
Kick, plié, kick, plié.
Higher, plié, higher, plié.
Up, plié, up, plié.
OK, girls, take five.
Two more weeks, Amy.
Yeah, I know.
You sound thrilled.
It's just happening so fast, you know?
And I'm not sure I want to get married.
I mean, not just to Phil...
to anybody.
Personally, I always liked Marvin.
One of your few failures.
I tried hard.
The guy's got willpower.
Phil doesn't even want me to have a career.
He's hinting I should quit school.
Not exactly your liberated male.
Mm-mmm.
Now, you take Bernie...
I'll take Bernie.
She will take Bernie.
Don't you dare.
Bernie has lots of money, and he'll do anything I say.
What about that professor?
Yeah. Hmm?
Darling, that's lust.
Pure lust!
Give me a break.
Well, it's a chance to ace philosophy this weekend.
It's too bad they don't give anything higher... than an "A," like a double "A." Or a triple "A." My average could sure use it.
- That's for sure.
- Who asked you?
Everybody up!
Oh, shit.
Come on.
Hey, Amy, you don't have to get married, you know.
Ready, and...
You going to stay the night?
Your parents are away for a week, right?
- Right.
- I'm staying a week.
- Good!
- Look who's coming.
Hey, he's really cute when he's not teaching.
- Is that his wife?
- Doesn't she know about you?
No, no.
Oh, right.
The party.
- I have to go back on Tuesday.
- That's right.
I'd like to go on Wednesday, too.
What's the matter?
Hello, Professor.
Hi.
Do I know you?
We're in your class.
Oh!
That's right. My class.
Right.
They're in my class, honey.
Yeah.
The introductory class, right?
- Right!
- That's the one.
That's right. Beginners.
That's nice.
We thought so.
Oh, this is my wife, and this is...
I'm sorry.
I seem to have forgotten your names.
I'm Joyce.
How do you do, Joyce?
This is Nancy.
- Hello. - Hi, Nancy.
- And that's Amy.
- Hi.
I think you girls should hurry home... and study for Monday's final.
You wouldn't give me an "F," now, would you, Professor?
I think that's the right idea, Professor.
Bye.
Nice to meet you. Good-bye!
See you Monday!
Study hard.
What was that all about?
These kids...
Sometimes they really seem a little foolish.
I'm gonna bust his balls tonight.
- Joyce.
- Well, I am!
Come on, you guys. I'll be late for my fitting.
- Yeah, right.
- OK! I'll see you tonight.
- All right.
- Bye!
God damn it.
Watch where you're going!
Can I help you?
Yeah. An ice cream cone, please.
What flavor?
That one.
- Sugar cone?
- Sure.
One or two scoops?
Well, just one.
Raspberry!
You're really enjoying that, aren't you?
Delicious.
Sprinkles?
- Huh?
- Sprinkles?
Oh, no, thanks.
That's all right.
That's fifty cents.
Oh, I'm sorry.
There.
Thank you very much.
Hey!
Will you watch it?
- Marvin!
- This is my favorite shirt.
What are you doing here?
This was my favorite shirt.
I'll probably have to give it to one of the stiffs at work.
I thought somebody was following me.
Probably one of Phil's watchdogs.
Will you look at my shirt?
It'll come out, Marvin.
It won't.
This stuff stains. It's like blood.
Come on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Could we have some water, please?
- I spilled some...
- How'd you know where I'd be?
You have a fitting at Renaissance... followed by a rendezvous with Father McKenna.
You've been cross-examining my little sister again, huh?
Me?
Never.
Thank you.
She told me that turkey left town for his bachelor party.
Phil's not a turkey. OK.
He's an asshole.
Don't say that, Marvin.
How about the time he beat me up and stole my yo-yo?
Marvin, that was in the sixth grade!
I don't forget things like that.
At least this time he didn't beat me up.
And I wasn't stolen, Marvin.
You just lost me.
I left town for one lousy summer... and Phil sweeps you off your feet?
Well, you shouldn't have gone.
You shouldn't marry somebody on the rebound.
Rebound? !
This is such a pleasant place.
Why are you looking like that?
I'm the one that ended our relationship.
That's all right.
I forgive you.
Did you just come from the morgue?
Yeah.
They got me on days now. The regular guy died.
I gave him our best freezer.
Why are you still working there?
I like it.
It's fun, cool in the summer.
Very educational.
Are you still going into...
What's that called?
Forensic medicine.
You know, like Jack Klugman.
- Amy...
- Boy...
Don't marry Phil.
Two weeks from Sunday.
You coming?
Well, I thought it was very mature of you... to invite your old boyfriend to your wedding... and to show you how mature I can be... I ain't gonna be there.
Suit yourself.
You're too good for Phil, Amy.
Look, marry me!
Phil's weird.
He's got insanity in his family.
He's a closet...
Ralph, where's Roz?
Her sister got sick.
She's a beauty, isn't she?
Come on, let's put it on.
Try not breathing.
That's what Roz does.
Ralph?
Yeah.
Is it worth it?
Huh?
Well... getting married, I mean.
Get dressed, kid.
I'll tell you the truth, though.
Sometimes I wish I never got married... but other times, I wouldn't trade Roz for anybody.
Marriage is like that.
you learn to live with it... but it's better than being alone.
- Ralph?
- Yeah.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Come here.
Hey.
- Good.
- Yeah?
OK, there you are.
Now turn around.
- Yeah.
What? - I'm sorry.
It's all right. I'll get rid of it.
Yeah.
Good.
There.
Just one more.
It's all right. Just think of me as your father.
Yes, now...
You put it on.
Turn.
That's beautiful.
Finished.
OK, take it off.
Is anybody there?
Ralph?
Run away with me.
We'll move to New York... and exist on our intense love for each other.
What do you say?
How about it?
Get out of here, Marvin.
I want to talk to you.
Well, not now.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- What time tomorrow?
- 7:00.
Good.
Bye.
You didn't say good-bye.
- Good-bye, hard head.
- That's better.
Thanks, Ralph.
So long.
So long, kid.
Oh, Ralph, here.
And tell Rozalind I hope her sister feels better soon.
She better feel better soon.
I haven't had a good meal in three days. Anyway, I'm not so hot on customer relations.
You're not so bad.
Tell Rozalind I'll see her next week.
Bye-bye.
- Amy. - Oh!
Hello, Father.
Is this what's bothering you, Amy?
Yes.
You see, this is rusty water from a very leaky pipe.
If I ever remember, I'm going to have... to call a plumber and get it fixed.
Gosh.
Oh, but the organ.
Oh, yes, the organ.
Well, that's Mr. Smith, my cat.
You see, he's very fond of playing the organ... and very good, too.
Anything else?
No, I think that's quite enough.
Amy, are you still having second thoughts?
More than ever.
Well...
You know, that's not so very strange.
I know a lot of people who have been married for years... and they're still having second thoughts.
That's encouraging.
But they should've never been married to begin with.
They just made bad decisions and picked incompatible mates.
Are you trying to tell me something, Father?
Me? No. I don't meddle.
I just want you to be sure.
So, tell me... when are your parents coming home?
- Next week.
- That's nice.
I'll be glad to see your father.
Surprise!
All right.
Hey. Smile.
Wait, wait. One second.
OK.
What's in here?
It's probably very expensive.
I bet I know who that's from.
My God. Phil won't be able to keep his hands off me.
You need it.
I got to go.
You're seeing the professor.
Have a good time.
I'm so nervous.
I need that "A."
Leaving so soon?
Right. Look, cover for me if my folks call.
I told them I was going to stay over.
Sure, absolutely.
Don't be surprised if you don't hear from me until Sunday.
Oh, my God. I won't be.
- Bye-bye.
- Have a good time.
- I will. - And thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Good-bye, Joyce.
Oh, God, he's going to love this.
What do you got? You got something?
Yeah.
Middle-aged man... Killed and robbed over in Westfield.
So?
I'm not interested in middle-aged men, Frank.
This guy kills brides...
young brides.
All right, Frank, give me the rest of it.
It was at a bridal shop.
That's him.
I'm on my way.
I'm going to call them and tell them you're coming.
You tell them I'm coming. Don't tell them anything else.
Len, I got to tell them something.
Frank, give me some time.
Now, wait a minute. I'm looking at trouble here, Len.
You know what I'm saying?
And you know how badly I want him.
What happens if you don't get him?
- I'll get him.
- What happens if you don't?
I'll get him!
Thirty-six hours.
Thanks, Frank.
Tell 'em not to touch anything. Not a damn thing.
What's going on here?
Sit down.
You remember the Carlton case?
Joann Carlton?
No, you wouldn't remember.
You weren't even here.
A bride was killed... an hour before her wedding.
Len was going to marry her.
Now, he goes nuts for quite a while.
He spends three years tracking this psycho.
The guy's leaving a trail of bodies behind him.
Sure you made it?
You seen Marvin around lately?
Seen him around?
I can't get rid of the guy.
You know, the closer it gets to my wedding... the bigger pain he gets to be.
Tell him to get lost.
I can't.
I like him.
Maybe you should marry him instead of Phil.
And spend the rest of my life joking about dead bodies?
No, thank you.
There's this real cute guy I see jogging every morning. Yeah?
He stares at me all the time.
So why don't you let him pick you up?
No, I couldn't do that.
Why not?
You think I should?
Definitely.
I don't know.
OK, I will.
Good.
So, here's to you and the jogger.
No!
Stay away from me.
I won't do it in the kitchen.
Come back in here.
You shouldn't have done that this afternoon.
Done what?
Don't you play Miss Innocent with me.
You could've gotten my wife suspicious.
You know, I was thinking about... what you were telling us in class last week.
You mean you actually learned something?
I sure did.
I think we ought to have a Platonic relationship.
You're kidding.
No.
Don't believe that bullshit.
- But you said that Plato...
- It's all bullshit.
- Plato was bullshit?
- Philosophy is bullshit.
- Oh. - Now, this... is what it's all about.
Joyce.
Joyce!
Where are you?
I don't like the dark, Joyce.
You come any closer, and I'll jump.
We've been playing around for an hour.
Aw, poor Carl.
Damn right!
Poor Carl will start playing with himself in a minute... if you don't stop fooling around.
I thought you wanted me to start fooling around.
You know what I mean.
Come on, let's do it on the table.
I told you, the table's too hard.
No, it's not.
That's easy for you to say.
I'm the one on the bottom.
- I got you now.
- Carl...
What are you going to do?
Huh? What are you going to do?
Come on, it's spooky out here!
Oh, yeah?
I'm going to leave you out there a little longer.
What are you going to do now?
You going to cut it out?
- Yes!
- Yeah? You promise?
Promise?
- Yes!
- Promise?
Gonna do it on the table?
I'll do it on the table, you son of a bitch!
You sure?
Oh, I'll kill you.
I'm going to give you an "F"!
Bitch.
Oh, that hurt.
Now...
All right.
Hold it.
What now?
Now, you wouldn't give me an "F"... would you, Professor?
Well?
An "A" plus.
Come on up here. Come on.
Did you hear something?
- No.
- Maybe it's your wife.
She won't be back until Monday.
You sure?
What was that?
The darkness.
- Stop it, Carl.
- Oh, brother.
What happened to the lights?
It was probably just a fuse.
Come on.
- Go see what it is.
- I don't want to!
- Go check it out.
- It's dark out there!
Listen, brave one, you ain't getting nothing... until the lights get back on.
Nothing?
Zilch.
Oh, shit!
You better be here when I get back.
What happened?
I fell.
Don't hurt yourself!
Thanks.
That's it.
Forget it.
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.
It's too damned dark down there.
No lights.
Weird sounds.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
I've come to suck your blood.
Hey...
What the heck?
Who is it?
The bogeyman.
Marvin.
Marvin.
Joe sent me.
What are you doing here?
Well, you said come by at 7:00.
Not 7:00 in the morning.
There you go, Syd.
It's your new home.
Give him room, you guys.
I just got off work. They got me on night shift again.
Why are you still bringing me fish?
Remember what I told you when I gave you this tank?
Mm-hmm.
Every time you visit me... you're going to bring me a fish.
Well, I'm visiting you... and that's a fish.
That's dumb, Marvin.
That's really dumb.
Besides, I'm sick of goldfish.
Marry me, and I'll bring you a piranha.
That's a tempting offer, but I'll pass.
How about if I cried?
Oh, Marvin.
You know, there are plenty of other girls... that would love to go out with you. Lorna, for one.
She only wants me for my body.
How about if I begged?
Please?
Just give it a rest, Marvin.
So, tell me... is it true what I've been hearing on campus?
What have you been hearing on campus?
That you dumped Phil.
You don't give up, do you?
I did once. January 5, 1973. You remember Mary O'Connor?
The Virgin Mary.
That's the one.
I took her to the drive-in movie.
She said no, and I stopped.
I believed her.
But you've always been a gentlemen, Marvin.
It was the biggest mistake I ever made.
Later I found out she was saying no to everybody... a couple of times before giving in.
But I've said no more than a couple of times.
Well, maybe I haven't asked the question enough.
Would you like some coffee?
No, not for me.
It's no good for you.
You ought to see what it does to the liver.
It makes me sick just to think about it.
You know El Exigente... the guy that drinks all the coffee?
He has no liver.
It's a liver destroyer.
We had this one stiff we opened about a week ago...
Marvin?
His liver looked like it'd been punched...
- Marvin!
- What?
- Don't you want to hear...
- Marvin?
Look outside.
OK, I looked.
He's gone.
Who's gone?
That man.
What man?
That man who's following me.
He's gone.
Amy, why would anybody want to follow you?
I don't know.
But now he knows where I live.
Wait just a second.
Oh, Marvin.
I didn't see anybody.
I'm scared, Marvin.
Hey, if I'd have known it was this easy... I would've scared you a long time ago.
You don't believe me.
You think I imagined the whole thing.
Amy, there wasn't anybody out there.
Yes, there was.
No.
Can't a girl get any sleep around here?
- Hello, Marvin.
- Hi. Did somebody die?
How you doing, Nance?
I've got an awful hangover.
Are you making coffee?
- Yeah.
- Good.
I need it.
We're not going to run today, are we?
Yeah, of course we are.
We've got to meet that friend of yours.
Oh, yeah.
I'll probably throw up all over him.
What's wrong with you?
Hey, Marvin.
I think I ate too much cake last night.
This is some lively group.
I think I got to go.
We're going to the amusement park later.
Would you like to come?
Oh, I wish I could... but I'm dissecting a cat in biology later this week.
I need to pick up a few strays so I can practice.
That's what everybody says.
Amy, if you need me, you know where to reach me.
Thanks, Marv.
You haven't called me that since...
Take care.
I'm Gamble. "Daily Globe."
Oh, yes. They're in the back. They're waiting for you.
Are you Gamble?
Took you long enough.
I'd like to know what the hell's going on around here.
I got the guys from the lab hanging around doing nothing... the reporters crawling all over my back... and I gotta wait for you.
Look, we didn't touch nothing.
The guy cleaned out the cash register.
I don't understand why the hell... you're so damn interested in an open and shut case.
It's a simple robbery and murder.
Look, pal, you wouldn't be holding back on me, would you?
Detective Thompson, you got a mess of people outside.
They want to know what's going on.
Take care of them.
Let's go out there.
"Amy Jensen."
Those guys are always down my throat.
- Listen...
- The name's Thompson.
Thompson.
Anybody else work here?
Yeah, the dead guy's wife.
Find her.
She might be able to help.
And what are you going to be doing?
Sleeping.
I had a long drive.
He's a big help.
You know I don't have the time now.
There he is!
See him?
That's your victim?
- Yeah.
Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go get him?
- Go on!
- OK.
I'll see you later.
I'm too tired to scream from the pain you just caused me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
I stretched out an extra foot to make sure I'd trip you.
Why'd you do that?
Well, it seemed the best way to meet you. - Oh.
- My name's Elliot. Hi.
How do you do?
I'm Nancy.
I hate jogging.
So do I.
I know who the next girl is, Frank.
Never mind how.
I just know who it is.
All I have to do is wait for her to lead me to him.
Frank, it's my case.
Leave them out of it.
Too bad they don't have a roller coaster.
Thank God for small things.
Don't you like to be scared, Am?
No. Most people do, actually. I mean, like to be scared.
It's something primal, something basic.
Horror movies and the roller coasters... and the House of Horror rides.
I want to go on that next!
And you can face death without any real fear of dying.
It's safe.
You can leave the movie... or get off the ride with a vicarious thrill... and the feeling that you just conquered death. One hell of a first class rush.
Don't tell me. You're a psych major.
Good deductive guess.
I'm most interested in fear, the emotion of fear.
For example, why, after seeing "Psycho"... were so many people afraid to take showers?
Not me.
I never saw the movie.
You were afraid, right?
You bet.
Fear fascinates me.
People pay to be scared.
And when you think about it... it's really ridiculous.
Give me some.
Ridiculous.
That's the word I was looking for.
Amy's been a little edgy lately.
She's getting married in two weeks.
And she thinks some maniac's following her around.
Oh.
Guilt.
Freud would have a field day with that.
You see?
Now you have a professional opinion.
- Thank you.
- Is he a big man?
Let's just forget about it, OK?
No, no. Answer my question.
Is he a big man?
Yes.
Definitely sexual.
Let's just change the subject, all right?
Have you seen this man while you were with us?
- No.
- And you won't.
The hallucination will only manifest itself... when you're alone.
How far are you in psych?
Psych One. Introduction to Psychology.
An expert.
Want a Goober?
No, thanks.
Come on.
Come on, Am.
- What do you want?
- I want cotton candy.
Cotton candy.
OK, one cotton candy.
- Hey, you got any change?
- Are you serious?
Here you go.
You like that?
No, all I have is a five.
- How much is this?
- $4.00.
We'll take it. I want you to have this.
Thank you.
And I want you to have this, too.
- Now I owe you four. - You sure?
Come on, let's go
No, thank you.
Hey, Amy?
I think we'll skip this one.
What, do you want to leave?
Yeah.
I'll meet you back home, OK?
Sure.
Have a real good time.
- OK.
Bye.
- Bye.
Say, have you got a dime?
What for?
Well, I want to call my roommate... and have him vacate the premises.
Why?
Well, I thought we'd play a game of backgammon.
I don't like to play games.
Oh, god.
That was scary.
Come on, Am!
I have two more tickets!
No, really. This is silly.
Come on, let's go. Please? Come on.
- It's just a ride.
- All right, come on.
If you're scared, Amy, you can hold onto me.
Oh, my God!
No!
Oh, my God!
No!
Oh, my God!
Boy, that was great.
Let's do it again.
No, let's...
Come on.
Amy, come on!
Now, come on.
Hey, Phil, come on!
We're waiting for you!
Let's go!
Hey, Phil, get me a beer.
Hey, did you get that thing?
Come on!
Hey, put it back!
Come on, put it back.
Hey, Phil, come on!
Come on, Amy.
Answer the phone.
Yeah, he's on the phone.
Hey, Phil, come on!
Hey, Phil, I'm waiting for you!
Are you really going to marry that turkey?
I don't like Phil.
Marry Marvin.
I like him.
He makes me laugh and helps me with my homework.
Sometimes Phil helps me with my homework... and he gives me the answers all wrong.
Besides, Phil's younger brother... is even a bigger asshole than he is.
Hi, Nance.
How's Elliot?
He's fine.
- We saved you a burger.
- No, thanks.
Elliot's taking me out to dinner tonight.
Why don't you run upstairs and get your knapsack?
It's almost time for me to take you to that party.
Oh, OK.
I saw him again, Nancy.
- What, that man?
- Yeah.
When?
Today at the amusement park.
He must've followed me there.
I saw him after you and Elliot left.
Amy, are you sure this is the same man?
Of course I'm sure.
Look, I'm gonna cancel my plans with Elliot tonight.
Oh, no, that's silly. You don't have to do that.
I know I don't have to, but I want to.
Amy, I'm worried about you.
I'm ready!
You'll be here when I get back?
Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere.
- Just hurry back, OK?
- I will.
Amy?
Diane?
You two forget something?
See you tomorrow.
You goddamn idiot!
Can't you see the one-way sign, for crying out loud? !
You come down the street any way you like?
You're a dope!
I'm a cop, for Christ's sakes!
Here, here!
Come on, you idiot!
Ah, jerk bastard!
Shit!
Amy?
Oh!
Oh, no!
Oh, God.
No!
No!
The keys... Where are the keys?
Oh, no!
No!
Oh, my God!
No!
Keys!
Get the fucking keys!
No!
The keys, the keys.
God damn it!
He scores!
Yeah, it's a tie ball game once more.
And now looking for the 2-3 zone.
- Oh!
Marvin!
- Amy!
Amy, what is it?
What's the matter?
He's after me, Marvin.
He's trying to kill me.
He killed Nancy.
Wait, wait. What are you talking about?
The man that I saw through the window.
Do you remember?
He's after me.
He's trying to kill me.
Amy, we've been through all this before.
Nobody's after you. Nobody's trying to kill you.
There's nobody...
Oh, shit.
You mean this whole thing's been on the level?
Yes.
What are we going to do?
Do?
You call the police, and I'll go check it out.
- I'll be right back.
- Marvin, please be careful.
You don't have to tell me that.
I'll be right back.
Call the cops.
Marvin?
This is Gamble.
Get me Thompson.
I'm at the residence of an Amy Jensen.
That's at 242 Warden.
There's been a homicide.
- Did you say Jensen?
- That's right.
An Amy Jensen just called from the morgue... and said that someone was trying to kill her.
Where the hell is the goddamn morgue?
It's on Walnut and South Street.
All you have to do...
Marvin?
Marvin?
No!
No!
No!
Get out of here.
Go on, get out of here!
Come on. Come on, you're all right.
Get out of here. Come on!
Go, go, go.
Get out.
Get out of here!
Go on! Go on!
He's in there!
He's downstairs!
It's OK.
It's all right.
It's over now.
She's so cute.
All right. Now just...
Hi.
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold it.
OK.
Nervous?
Nah.
Don't worry.
Hey, I'm ready.
Phil... what are you doing here?
James!
She let you go then?
I wish you could see into my heart, James, and know that, this very night... I am going to repent of all my sins.
James!
James! Where are we supposed to be?
My friends... if it be not a mere farce -
If it be not a mere farce you are enacting... in these sacred valedictory rites... if you mean them, feel them - as I know you do... they have for you a mandate of imperative duty.
Hallelujah!
It is not great wealth alone... that builds the library... founds the college... that is to diffuse a high learning and culture among a people.
It is the contact... of the cultivated mind with the uncultivated.
If it be true... that the constitution of American society... is peculiarly hostile now... to all habits of thought and meditation... it doubly behooves us -
It doubly behooves us... to look well to the influence we may exert.
A high ideal - the education of a nation.
class of '70... friends, parents... relations of the class of '70... I now introduce your class orator -
Mr. William C. Irvine.
William.
Give us a good one, Bill!
class of '70... ladies and gentlemen... friends of the class of '70...
That's your friend.
There is a story told by an ancient author... of a young man who being noticed by his friend to look dejected... was questioned by him... concerning the cause of his troubled appearance.
The youth used no concealment... but told him that, for three days... he had been vainly endeavoring with his utmost efforts... to find an exordium for a subject on which he had to write.
Whereupon, his friend replied with a smile...
"Do you wish to write better than you can?"
"And such," says the old author, "is the whole truth of the matter.
We must endeavor to speak to the best of our ability... but we must speak according to our ability."
And similar to the distress of this youth was my own trouble... when upon examining the old skeleton upon which most college orations are hung - I considered how I might incarnate that familiar framework.
Of course, I at once decided not to attempt any profound... or difficult matter... lest having given the dry bones at best but a long tongue - puny strength.
And after much careful and calm meditation... the class has refused to advise alteration... on the usual law that is called gravitation.
Though we had thought at one time of having it stopped... in order that some of us might not be dropped.
But the mind of mankind perhaps will be gratified to learn... that, at last, the law has been ratified... and the common result can be counted on still.
All rivers, as usual, flowing downhill.
The seasons, in turn, will continue to roll.
We shall ask for no change in the north or south pole.
The sun will continue to set in the west.
The majority of us considered it best.
We disclaim all intention of making a change... in what... we esteem... on the whole...
I don't know where to look.
Well arranged.
Excuse me.
- God, you're beautiful.
- So are you.
Are you alone?
Oh, yes.
Come on.
Where is it?
Fuck you, bastards!
Let him through!
Let him through! Fuck you bastards!
Come on!
Get him up!
Come on.
Come on, you bastards!
You did it, James!
You got it, James!

Goddamn ignorant bastards.
Go back to where you came from!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Pardon me.
If I could get by, please.
Thank you very much.
Try to keep moving, folks.
Thank you.
Casper.
Move along, please.
That you, Cully? Yes.
Yes.
Howdy, Jim.
Howdy.
Well, I will be damned.
What in the hell are you doing here in that rig?
There's hard times, Jim.
A citizen's got to make a dollar any way he can these days.
I thought you was still up in Johnson County.
I am.
Well, what are you doing down here, then, in this part of the world?
I brought an immigrant woman in for hanging. Federal penitentiary, St. Louis.
Is the law hanging women now, are they?
She shot her husband six times in the head and then the kids.
God of shit.
Maybe I'm overdue for a new life myself, Cully.
- So how is things in St. Louis anyways?
The bank just crashed.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What's next?
Time to get out, Cully. Head west.
I already been there.
Well, you got yourself a-a fit driving' carriage here.
Taking it back up to Johnson County, are you?
Tonight, if it doesn't snow.
Say, another citizen was killed up there day before yesterday.
Caught speed butchering a steer with a hatchet. Michael
- Michael Kovach, I believe it was.
Mike Kovach, you say?
I tell you, every new citizen takes up land here... the big fellas blackball him.
A citizen steals to keep his family from starving - and they-they threaten them off or kill them.
- Goddamn. - I'll tell you something, Jim. I'll tell you something.
If the rich could hire others to do their dying for them... the poor could make a wonderful living.
- The Arab horse is yours, too, I see.
- Well, that's a fine-looking animal.
Take him on down to the stable.
It's getting more crowded every day, isn't it?
Those poor sons of bitches sit around weeks waiting for claims verifications.
Do they know what's waiting for them out here?
No, they don't.
They do not.
They just sit here in the asshole of creation... some of them starving right in front of my eyes.
Babies too.
Every damn day, I swear I'm not gonna give 'em another penny.
I'm a poor citizen myself.
What can you do?
I'm as human as the next citizen.
I'm a human being, ain't I?
I'm not ashamed of it.
I tell - I tell you, Jim. I got so I can't stand this job already.
- There you go, Cully.
It's on me this time.
- You don't have to do that, Jim.
What do you want to go and do a thing like that for?
Harness up the Studebaker for me, will you?
I'll be back for it presently.
Well, I - I'll put your grip in there for you.
Set this up there in that carriage.
I don't want to see a scratch on it.
Say, Jim!
Jim!
Watch yourself.
I mean take care of yourself.
Aw, I don't - I don't know what I mean.
Thanks, Cully.
Don't let these citizens get to you.
Yeah. You know that.
Dudley, I do believe I am finally working' for a rich firm.
How many gun hands you - - Association?
- Name's Morrison.
Sign here.
I want a new suit of clothes and a Witte's Special 12-gauge shotgun.
Suits are over there at the self-service rack.
I'll get the other.
Association?
Where's Zindel?
Died.
Apoplexy.
Well, you struck it rich here, friend.
Mister, I ain't got spit enough to pass the time of day.
- What can I do for you?
- Winchester '66. Brandy - BB.
I feel like these immigrants comin' in here these days are -
I think that's enough, friend.
I said you already won.
Says who, old man?
I can't believe you fixed your mouth to say that, boy.
You people go back where you came from.
Go back where you came from!
What's going on here, Cully?
Well, you hear a lot of things around a rail depot, Jim.
Rumors mostly.
Listen, I-I - I can't aff - I can't afford to get involved.
Damn it, I just got this job.
Whoa, boy.
Aw, hell.
I was over last night to the Sage Hotel having meself some Baltimore oysters... when I met up with a couple of citizens there.
A Mr. Morrison and Mr. Budley.
No, that ain't right.
Dudley. That's what it was. Dudley.
One of the biggest damn citizens I ever seen... with two eyes in his head like a dead fish.
Well, I
- I had a long drink with this Morrison and Dudley... and-and they said to me - they said to me that they was - they was currently in the employ of the Stock Growers Association... and that the Association was hiring up a big mob from all over the northwest.
Well, every citizen's business is his own affair, not mine, damn it.
I believe I'll pay the Association a little call while I'm here.
- Watch my goods, Cully.
- Right, Jim. Right.
Displace us and our capital... and 50 years must pass before the earth can be made... to produce the same wealth in any other form.
This is no longer a poor man's country.
These emigrants only pretend to be farmers.
But we know many of them personally to be thieves and anarchists... openly preying on our ranges.
No jury in Johnson County will indict them... even in the face of evidence as conclusive as any ever offered in a court of justice. Right.
Yeah, they're an ignorant, degraded gang of paupers.
Their only stock-in-trade consists of having large numbers of ragged kids.
Out of 180 indictments, we have had one conviction in four years.
That man was caught with the hide and the bones of the stolen animal.
He was found guilty of stealing the hide and the bones only... which were valued at $18... making his crime petty larceny.
The jury evidently took it for granted... that the rest of the animal was still out roaming the range.
Unenforced law is an invitation to anarchy.
Consequently, the Stock Growers Association... will now and publicly wipe out these thieves and anarchists.
We are employing 50 men on the basis of five dollars a day... and $50 for every cattle thief shot or hung.
We will go to Johnson County... we will depose the incompetent civil authority there... and we will keep possession of the town until we can take charge of the courts.
We have placed 125 names on a death list.
I know that it is popular at present to hamper justice for us.
But, gentlemen... to kill... 125 people... all at one time?
Huh? Well, that will only further prejudice public opinion against ourselves.
So I'm going to move that we stop... right here.
I had a very satisfactory talk with the governor yesterday.
He asserted in the most positive terms his wholehearted support... as well as that of the Senate and the House of Representatives... and the president of these United States.
If we fail, the flag of the United States fails.
That's all I'm going to say before we ask every one of you... to express your approval of the general plan of campaign.
We'll call the roll and take a voice vote. Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
- Stratton.
- Yes.
- Vaughn.
- Yes.
- Hall. - Yes.
- Ward. - Yes.
- Cummings.
- Most definitely.
- Steel.
- Hardly.
- Weatherford.
Miller.
- Tower. - Yes.
- King. - Yes.
- Thompson.
Holy God of the Prophets.
James.
Hello, Billy.
We've just been debating... one of your county's more infamous legal decisions.
Incidentally, does anybody else know that you're here?
Just you.
Why the hell did you come here?
Well, why do we do anything, Billy?
"As we ask but time to drift... drift and note the devious ways of man.
To drift... and to scan the truths... that underlie the surface faiths whereby men live and die."
W.C. Irvine, Hasty Pudding.
1869.
Billy, you're the only son of a bitch I ever knew worth getting seriously drunk with.
It's true.
Yes, that's true, you know.
James, you snookered yourself again.
Do you know, James... one half of my drunkenness can be accounted for... by the fact that this building is so poorly ventilated.
Two rails, side pocket.
What's going on here, Billy?
Ugly rumors, James.
That's a gob of spit, Billy.
A hundred names... or thereabouts. On a list.
Just some of these emigrants that they're going to kill off.
Even they can't get away with a thing like that.
Well... in principle... everything can be done.
In principle.
What'll you do, Billy?
I'm a victim of our class, James.
- Good-bye, Billy.
Do you remember the... good, gone days?
Clearer and better every day I get older.
You were blackballed out of this club long ago, Averill.
You're trespassing.
We could have you shot here - legally.
Legally, you bastards have a right to protect your own property.
But unless you got a signed legal warrant... for every name on that death list... stay out of my county.
You offset every effort we make to protect our property... and that of members of your own class.
You're not in my class, Canton.
You never will be.
You'd have to die first and be born again.
Frank! - Watch yourself. - You all right, Frank?
- Frank. Frank, are you all right?
- Let's help him up. Get him up first, all right?
- All right!
I'm all right!
Let's go.
What happened?
They came this way and killed him.
Well, what'II you do out here now?
Work our land.
Without a man?
He paid, uh, $150 for it.
We own it now.
I'll take you back.
I'll settle this. I promise you that.
We'll work our land.
Thank you.
Well, good-bye then. And good luck.
Thank you.
Whole damn country will be nothing but widows and orphans soon.
The Stock Growers Association is the largest association of its kind in the world.
We plan to publicly wipe out... 125 thieves, anarchists and outlaws.
I still need 25 more experienced men... who want to make a lot of money.
What's it pay?
We are employing on the basis of five dollars a day plus expenses... and $50 for every thief and anarchist shot or hung.
Who's paying, mister?
You don't worry about that.
Who's paying?
I'm paying.
Stand aside here.
Son of a bitch.
Even the goddamn kids now.
I ain't kid.
I'm married man.
Get out of here before I blow your brains out, married man.
Don't do it, married man.
You're very lucky you're not dead already.
Just... take it easy now, mister, huh?
My family starving.
You know that.
That don't give you room to steal.
You look like one of us.
You work for them?
I'll decide what I am.
I'm not going to kill a kid still pisses in his pants.
Now get on out of here.
Goddamn traitor!
- ...einem Dollar?
- Ein Dollar. Ein Dollar?
Put it down.
- Pay attention, will you?
- Ja, ja. - If you wanna do this job, do it right.
- Ja, ja.
I'll give a dollar to twenty-five cents.
You got it.
Get them back, Willy!
Top him!
Top him!
Keep back, Schultz!
Keep back, Schultz!
Keep him back, Willy!
All right.
Is he hurt?
- Speak English.
I can see that.
All right.
That's it, baby.
Now, keep his head wet.
Get ready.
Stop pushing!
Morning, Jim.
So how's St. Louis?
Thank you.
That's a fine piece.
- How's business? - Business? Good.
Ah, these people.
You know them. Don't have but a pot to piss in.
But people always get thirsty after a funeral.
And I'm not about to sit and watch the grass grow... when there's money to be made.
Yeah, well, most of them can't even afford a funeral... let alone their wives and kids.
Get them all the hell out of here before church opens.
Association's declared war, J.B.
They want to get rid of all this.
Fifty dollars for every citizen on the list shot or hung.
Tell me when you want to get serious.
I am serious.
There's 125 names on a death list.
My God.
That's almost everybody in the county.
How can people declare war on a whole county?
I guess, on principle, everything can be done.
Goddamn.
It's getting dangerous to be poor in this country.
It always was.
Have you told anybody else yet?
No, not yet.
No, let them have their Sunday.
Tomorrow morning will be time enough.
I told that black-bearded -
He put feet on my land one more time, I kill him!
- What happened to your head?
- Why don't you ask him something?
All right, goddamn it, shut up!
All right, one of you tell me what's happening, and the rest of you shut up.
Please. Uh, please. It's not me who is making complaint.
- He come to me and wife -
- I kill you!
I kill you!
He come to me and my wife, and he using - Very bad word before wife!
And he never, uh, stop, listen what I have to say.
What did you have to say?
I say - I say, "I am truly sorry, but, uh, my property line crosses here."
I want that son of a bitch -
Albert, you put off yelling in here!
Okay, then what happened?
What the hell difference makes what happened?
He already admitting he's crossing my lines.
He, uh, knock me down... and, uh, I
- I take him by foot... and, uh, my wife hit him on head with rock.
That's lie!
That's lie!
I - I held him and, uh... my wife tie him up good... so that he was there last time when I see him until now.
That's another lie!
Remember! Out before church opens!
Good morning, Mr. Averill.
Good morning, George, Mrs. Eggleston.
I missed you.
What the hell is that?
I didn't have any breakfast yet.
Is that all that's stopping you?
Come on.
Pie?
I think it's the best one I ever did.
It's beautiful.
It belongs in a museum.
It's great.
- Mmm! - It's delicious. Mmm!
You eat the pie first.
It took me a whole day to make it for you, so you eat all of it.
Tell me something.
How do you manage to take care of business... and make pies at the same time?
Help me.
I brought your birthday present.
Yes?
Really?
It's very expensive, no?
What else have I got to spend my money on?
Where is it?
Is it here?
Where is it?
Tell me, please.
- Tell me. I can't stand it.
- Here.
I want to see.
Bye-bye.
I'm afraid to look.
Silly, isn't it? No.
I'll bring it out to you.
How do you like 'im?
It's so beautiful.
I can't stop crying.
I don't know what the hell is the matter with me.
I feel I finally got somewhere.
- I'm so happy I could bust.
- What's stopping you?
What the fuck is going on?
We just got to sleep around here.
Howdy, Nell! Ladies.
You just drag your tired old asses down here... and come see for yourself!
Boy, you got everything under control here?
Well, it ain't easy, Mr. Averill.
Come on!
Do you have any idea what one of these costs?
Come on, Bessie!
Watch out.
If you can - If you can see daylight between the trees, it's okay.
slow down, ella.
- Turn off before you get to town.
I don't want anybody to see me. - Whoo!
I want them to see me.
What good is it if nobody sees me?
Hello!
I'll be damned.
We're just in time.
Look!
Even the mayor is here.
Hello!
One more time!
Ride that son of a bitch, ella!
Scheisse.
Come on! Come on!
The water was real good.
Driving like that sure heats me up.
He's a man's horse.
He is not timid.
James, am I really pretty?
You never answer anything personal.
How anyone can think so much is beyond me.
- Now I'm doing it.
- Thinking.
- How do you like it? I don't.
You once said you liked me because I didn't. Didn't what?
Think so much.
Jesus.
When did I say that?
I don't remember the time of day.
But you said it all right.
- Well, what do you think?
- About what?
Leaving.
- Here?
- Wyoming.
- Wyoming?
- Yeah.
You son of a bitch.
Is that what the present was for?
I think you ought to stop fucking me around and tell me directly what's on your mind.
The state's gonna declare war.
Would you go?
alone?
No, of course I won't.
What the hell would you think I would say?
Goddamn it, it's different this time.
Maybe it ain't things are different.
Maybe it's you.
I'm getting old.
You think everything stops because you're getting old?
Maybe it does.
Two, three, four!
Barbed wire and women are the two greatest civilizing agents in the world!
- Whew! I can cut a steer... I can put my red-hot monogram on a maverick... in the darkest night that ever blew, ella... but I am poorly put up to paralyze a beautiful young thing like you... with matchless eloquence -
Oh, Jesus.
I don't understand you.
I never did.
I'm asking you to leave, ella.
Late for local business, isn't it?
Looks like Ella's been real busy.
Hello.
Come in.
You pay in advance here.
Cash or cattle?
Dozen head of long twos enough?
You can stay a whole damn year on that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Is that you, George?
Yeah.
Howdy, Nate.
You boys pay your tally here in cash money?
- For sure, Nate.
- Sure.
It's getting cold in here.
Good-bye.
Who's the photographer?
Just an ordinary photographer.
Passing through from St. Louis.
It's always the little skinny guys that surprise you.
I might do a little surprising around here myself tonight.
Oh, yes?
Situation out back's looking very prosperous.
You're getting too greedy, ella.
You never waste time, do you?
I'd awfully appreciate it if you'd stop taking steers for pay from these people.
Just like that?
Yes, ma'am.
- I saw that new rig out in the barn.
- Mmm. Nice, isn't it?
Jim back, is he?
This morning.
I'll take you for a ride tomorrow if you want to.
He's here now, is he?
Upstairs.
I knew.
I felt it.
Please, Nate.
You want to stay here tonight?
So you have to take him back.
He has the claims court tomorrow.
Goddamn.
Thank you, Nate.
You got style, Jim.
I'll give you that.
He ain't young anymore.
I'll take care of him, Mr. Champion.
Thank you.
Mr. Averill is lucky to have a friend like you.
Where you going in such a rush, Nell?
Aw, shit!
I'm gonna have me picture taken.
These goddamn son of a bitchin' cows.
Jesus Christ!
You can't even take a shit around here without stepping in it.
Look at this!
I'm up to me ass in shit.
- Goddamn it!
- Don't get nervous, Nate.
I'm going right back to watch the place now.
Entre.
I like to watch you write figures.
Why?
I don't know.
It just pleases me.
I thought you were getting to like me.
I do.
But I like money.
Why don't you quit this business?
I have enough money for both of us now.
That sounded close to a proposal.
Jim asked me to go away with him.
What?
I said Jim asked me to go away with him.
What did you say?
I said I would think about it.
Goddamn.
There's another man been shot by the Association's foreman - Nate Champion.
It was him shot Mike Kovach.
I know that, George.
I don't think you want to finish that, George.
And I haven't had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
Thank you, boys.
It's a long day.
You sure look like hell.
I really live it up when you're away.
You're a friend, Nate, so I'll come straight to it.
It's getting dangerous here, and I want ella to leave.
Good morning to you, too.
What makes you think she wants to go?
Let me put it this way. I'm not asking her.
- What about me?
- What about you?
What do you want, Nate?
Want?
How the hell do I know?
Get rich. Like you.
What am I supposed to want?
That's not a bad answer.
I don't understand you. I do not understand you.
There's a lot of things you don't understand.
You're beginning to sound like a man with a paper asshole, Jim.
I guess you've stretched your legs under my table long enough, Nate.
Man don't take on what he can't finish.
Son of a bitch.
- Where are the others?
- Nick's got them watched.
I had a year of this.
Dusk till dawn, dusk till dawn.
There's getting to be too many of them.
Too many people and not enough cattle.
We break our backs out here... and ella breaks her back on these Hunky mudfuckers.
What the hell was that for?
You just shut your big mouth, shitpoke.
Well, kiss my ass.
Son of a bitch.
You get on out of here.
Right now.
ella ain't your friend.
She ain't nobody's friend!
I got it! I got it! I got it!
Goddamn, you dumb-ass son of a bitch!
What the hell's the matter with you?
- Is Captain Minardi here, boy?
- Goddamn ball went right in the swamp.
You see that disaster out there?
Private told me to tell you it was the swamp, Frank.
"Swamp." You dumb son of a bitch!
All he can do is shoot. - Captain -
- Southerners. Shit. An army of mercenaries is about to invade Johnson County.
As president of the chamber of commerce, I demand that you put Company "C" -
Mr. Eggleston. Of the National Guard on alert in Johnson County.
I have a standing order to resist all commands... other than those directly from the governor himself.
- How long you had that, Frank?
- A week's time now.
- A week?
- I been expecting you.
You know, Frank, those men are gobbling up the whole state.
I still can't help you, Jim.
It's not me.
You understand?
It's the rules.
Do you have the death list?
Seems balls are getting scarce as hen's teeth in the army.
You know what I really dislike about you, Jim?
You're a rich man with a good name.
You only pretend to be poor.
This is damn near everyone in the county.
"ella Watson."
What the hell's she doing on this thing?
It, uh... says she takes stolen cattle in payment for carnal pleasures.
I guess some of these new citizens would rather get laid than feed their families.
It's all going to be legalized, Jim.
What'll you do?
My job.
You knew what you were getting yourself into.
You can't... force salvation on people, Jim.
It doesn't work.
I don't appreciate your job anymore, kid.
All right.
All right. All right!
- Stop it!
He doesn't give a damn about you.
He didn't see fit to even tell you himself.
Tell me what?
The Association's got a death list... and your name's on it.
My father was killed that way.
Get up, Nate.
I'm gonna whip your ass.
- Stop, please.
Now. Please, James, stop it.
- I ain't through with you yet.
Nate, is it true?
I swear to Christ, ella... I don't even know what he's talking about.
What's going to happen to me, Nate?
I asked you to be my wife, ella.
Where are you going?
You - You know I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I never have before.
You buy me things, and he asked me to marry him.
Maybe it was always in my mind to.
Well, that's not good enough.
Hurting now?
He's just lucky we stopped before he got into real trouble.
Yes.
When will you decide?
I don't know.
I suppose if - if I were you, I'd say no.
You know?
You would?
No question in my mind.
- Why?
- I don't know. There just isn't any.
You could be very wrong, you know.
Jim ain't your friend, ella.
He ain't nobody's friend.
He'll quit anybody if it suits him.
Whoa. Tie him.
Hey, Nate.
Hello, ella.
This sure is a fine-looking rig you got here, ain't it?
An old boy hunting wolves come by... and I told him that he could spend the night here.
Why don't you come in for a while?
You haven't been here for a long time.
I've fixed the place up inside.
What have you done to it?
- Wallpaper.
- Wallpaper?
Where did you find wallpaper?
Uh, everybody, that's Fred.
Say howdy, Fred.
Uh, that's ella Watson... and, uh, that's John DeCory hanging in the back there.
- You ready? - Mm-hmm.
Wallpaper?
Yeah, well, it, uh... civilizes the wilderness... if you know what I mean.
It's beautiful.
That don't appear to be right at all.
Hey, where are ya goin' now?
Where ya goin'?
Jesus!
Damn it.
Stopped.
It can't have stopped.
It can't have gone that far yet.
I never could stand this job anyways.
Come on!
Let's go!
Stick that right there.
You're late.
The governor came to see us off, Frank.
How much time do you estimate here, Canton?
Forty minutes.
Telegraph's cut.
Have the proper warrants been issued?
The president himself asked for these men to go, Billy.
Escort dismissed! - Columns of two.
Ho! - Come on, John.
Let's move it out!
Let's go!
Get the rest of that out of there.
Come on, unload those.
Let's go!
Armor made the knight.
The crown a king.
What are we?
Good morning to ya.
You have a nice sleep out here?
Say, who's minding the train station?
Another citizen.
Heading over to Johnson County, are ya?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm heading over there myself.
You mind if I ride along?
Well... you can - you can suit yourself... citizen.
What do you think of my new suit here?
I paid $50 on credit for it.
More than likely pay it off real soon though.
Fuck!
Oh, Christ!
Oh, Jesus! God!
Jesus.
They're coming!
And ever since then... I have never been hit by a bullet.
I been shot at many times... but I never been hit.
On the other hand now - catching wolves is baby's work.
I can - I can catch a wolf with my bare hands.
That's impossible.
It is?
How do you do that?
Well... first of all... you let the critter attack you.
You let him attack?
That's right.
You don't do a damn thing.
You just stand there real calm. Yeah?
Well, then what?
What do you mean then what?
Then... when that son of a bitch opens his - opens his jaws to bite your fool head off... you reach your hand down in there like lightning and
You grab hold his tongue.
What the hell good's that gonna do you?
He can't bite you if you got ahold of his tongue.
I don't see that at all.
Well, try it.
Try it.
Stick out your tongue.
Come on, Nick. Show us what you got in there.
Yeah.
Come on. Stick out your tongue.
Go on.
- Aw, hell. Here. - Come on.
- See that? Now bite me.
- Bite him, Nick.
- See that? - Bite him!
He can't do a damn thing.
Look at this, miss.
I got ahold of him. He can't bite.
Bite him. Bite him, Nick.
Come on, bite him.
Bite that thing! Here.
Maybe I ought to just cut it off. Shall I cut it off?
- Cut it off.
Son of a bitch.
He was right.
But now what happens when you let go?
He kills you.
You got to hang on till help comes.
Well, why don't - why don't you stay for supper?
I have things to settle with Jim.
That feel better?
Bye-bye, Nick.
Keep your tongue in your head.
You know I will.
- Bye-bye.
- Miss.
Will I be seeing you anymore then?
Maybe.
I'm glad I made up my mind, Nate.
Don't scratch that fancy paint none, ella.
The captain told me the National Guard can't do anything... but I'm sure you already know that.
Ruhe! Ruhe!
Goddamn it, quiet!
There's an armed mob of paid men... about to... invade your county. - With the open threat... to destroy... - Shh.
The Stock Growers Association... has the names of some of you people on a list.
A hundred and twenty-five names.
What are the names on the list?
Kormanik, V.
Kormanik, I.
Shh! Shh!
Kopestonsky, G.
Schultz, D.B.
Kaiser, A.
Albert.
Glover, Jr., B.
Shermerhorn, W.R. Guthrie, W.
Watson, E.
What are you going to do, huh?
Hastings, B.!
Kurz, D.
Szarabajka, C.
Widman, T.!
Fraleigh, T.!
Koppelman, H.!
Fritz, D.!
Swann, S.! Gorb, P.!
Everyone!
And you say everyone!
Whoa!
Now, John, you go and get Mr. Averill and tell him to come here as fast as he can.
All right?
Whoa, Taffy!
Whose horses are those?
Those are the Association's horses. Hurry up.
Hurry up!
Hello.
Help yourself.
There is enough whiskey for all of you.
There's enough here to take - take a bath.
Enjoy yourselves.
I'll go and get the girls.
If you don't stop... I'll bend that iron around your head.
It's all right, ain't it, Morrison?
I believe it's you the boys want.
All of them.
Okay, you pay in advance here.
Cash.
Or cattle.
I believe you have enough of the Association's cattle out back... to pay for all of us... without coming up for air... the whole month of July.
Stay with me.
It's all right.
Maybe you'll understand better the kind of people you're working for now.
The tragedy, Nate... is you people were in the right... legally.
But they just threw that away.
Oh, my God.
- What's going on here?
- Firing squad.
- Who gave that order? - Canton.
Before I could get to my feet... hit on me with a log... biting and stomping.
Grabbed the little bitch around the neck.
This time, I had my knife.
I didn't stop cutting until I felt the blood running.
Not in here!
I have nothing to say to you.
You better have a guaranteed warrant for every name on that list.
Show me one for the man outside right now.
Major?
When the fix is equal... then justice must prevail.
Shut up, Billy.
You people make me sick.
Let's not have any last-minute sentimentalism... about the killing of a few thieves and anarchists.
Did you ever kill a man yourself, Canton?
Mr. Champion... my grandfather was the secretary of war to Harrison.
His brother was a governor of the state of New York.
My brother-in-law is the secretary of state... and, to you, I represent the full authority... of the government of the United States and the president.
Fuck him too.
Bravo, sir.
I've had about enough of your shit too, Billy!
You silly son of a bitch!
You were hired to enforce the law.
We are the law.
Is that supposed to mean you're going to Nate?
Do you think a woman can't love two men?
Sure, you can.
Why not?
Or three.
But it sure as hell isn't convenient.
I can manage it.
Even after today?
Today was just the beginning.
Do you think they'd have tried what they did if it wasn't - if something bigger wasn't coming?
Everything I have in the world is here.
I can't just walk out and leave it.
This?
This junk?
Jesus Christ, ella, these are just things.
Spare me that, will you?
What does "piety" mean?
A dumb whore.
Those are my books.
I can see what they are.
- Balanced to the penny.
- I don't care about that now.
I do.
I never cheated on you.
I always made Nate pay.
That was all a nice game, ella... and it's over.
He asked me to marry him.
ella, I'm asking you again to leave.
I'm begging you.
I do care for you.
I'm grateful to you, Jim, for everything.
And I love you... for it.
Try to believe my feeling for you. And my debt to you for the... protection in the beginning and now remains unchanged.
What else can I tell you?
It is Nate, isn't it?
You're a hard man to compliment.
Well, you take it all.
Both of you.
It's more your country than mine anyway.
Good-bye, ella.
I'll miss you.
Have a last drink with me.
I hate getting old.
You boys make yourself at home.
Is everybody here?
Yeah, all except for the idiots who want to fight.
We're not all, uh, anarchists... a-and, uh, criminals here, Averill.
We're storekeepers and merchants.
Why'd you come here?
Uh, we want you to talk to them, um... to offer to help turn in the people on the list.
They have the law on their side.
The National Guard can't help us.
The law is the law.
See, whatever it is, it is.
It's your job.
You look like a man about to shit a pumpkin, Charlie.
I don't have to take that, Averill.
I'm the mayor here.
You are out now.
You're fired.
They have 50 men, Charlie.
Together you're 200. Your
- Your hopes are exaggerated.
In the end they will - they will get it all anyway.
And if it takes a hundred years - But
- But they will get it.
Well, what about right now, Charlie?
Right here.
I'm sorry. I'm -
I'm afraid you have misjudged us.
You can't fire me, Charlie.
But I just quit.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Well, I was just going to take a bath.
You taking a bath too?
Oh, shit.
- You know him?
- Never seen him before.
How many are in there?
Nate Champion?
We're wasting time here, Canton.
These two don't matter anymore.
Well, they're resting the horses anyway.
It'll be good for discipline.
You ought to understand that better than anyone else.
You're the professional army man.
I'm the amateur.
You go in there... and tell them they're completely surrounded... and they must surrender immediately.
If you come back out, we'll hold our fire till you're clear.
You have one minute.
It's comin' in like hail!
Jesus Christ!
ella!
Jesus Christ!
Damn it!
Nate.
I got that loud... son of a bitch!
I reckon that man has killed himself.
Goddamn you!
Christ!
Should've gone right into town.
Shh! We all want to hold together... to push ourselves ahead, to protect what we have.
And make more of it.
There's no use in lying down or giving up.
He says that... he quits this morning... his employment of Averill.
Jim Averill came here to protect people's rights.
Ja. Averill is still his friend.
There is only one crime in this country... and that is to get caught!
They are opposed... to - to anything that would settle... and improve things in this country. Or try to make it something more than...
Cow pasture. for - for...
They... advanced the idea... that poor people have nothing to say in the affairs of this country!
They're here.
They're here.
They're already here.
We're going to shoot all the sons of bitches!
And even the army won't save them!
He's dead.
Well, say something, goddamn it.
What?
I told you so?
Well, I told you so.
He loved you.
He thought you were his friend.
I'm not responsible.
He knew what was coming. He made his own decision.
And so did you.
They just voted against you, Charlie!
Your fears are unfounded!
Somebody, please!
We need a physician!
You're going the wrong way!
This way!
ella, go home!
Mount up.
Boys.
They're coming!
Whole damn town's coming!
What the hell's going on?
Stay together!
Keep on!
Over in there!
Move it around those trees!
Get that wagon over here!
Everybody get in position over here!
Get yourself around these trees!
Dismount!
Get your horses in here and dismount!
You son of a bitch!
- Get that wagon over here!
- Stay in position!
Get the hell out of here!
Get down by these trees!
Did you hear the command? Get in position!
Fire!
Stay down, goddamn it!
Get the hell out of here!
Get down!
Get down, Billy!
I sometimes wonder why the hell you're here at all!
For America!
Too many of them, Wolcott.
It's not like the Indians.
You can't just kill them all.
Finally hit us some pay dirt here.
Get down!
This time last year I was in Paris.
I love Paris.
Get off the wagons!
David!
Oh, God, do I love Paris.
Get down!
All flesh is grass.
Sad -
Sad thing.
Come with me.
Wolcott!
I'm going for help.
I'll be back!
Get out of range!
Take cover!
Pull back across the river!
Take cover!
I... just want to live.
"It don't look as if there's much chance of my getting away.
I hope they did not hurt ella.
The house is all fired.
Good-bye, ella and Jim... if I never see you again.
Nathan D. Champion."
Are you all right, ella?
Wait for me at your place.
Is really good work.
Where did you get idea for this?
Romans used them, something like 2,000 years ago... on terrain just about like this.
Go!
Those goddamn Romans.
Go!
Averill, you son of a bitch, we're going to hang you.
Keep going!
- Everyone together! - Come on!
I think my legs are broken!
Get back!
These men are under arrest by military authority!
You can all go home now!
You know these men are under the jurisdiction of civil authorities.
Well... I have here a telegram from the governor... stating in the most positive terms... that only immediate and drastic action... on the part of authorities outside and above county officials... can reduce the current state of almost anarchy... in Johnson County.
"Almost anarchy."
Jim, you can let me take them out of here peacefully... or you can get shot for insurrection.
Rescue 'em is what you're doing.
I told you, Jim, it's not me that's doing it to you.
It's the rules.
Company, move out! Follow about!
Damn you!
Oh, ella, don't die.
Oh, please.
Oh, my God.
I'd like a cigarette.
Hey, Pete, are you sure this is the place?
You saw the letter.
This is the place.
Listen, pal. Don't you think it's funny, your uncle just giving you this race car?
Sentimental reasons.
Would a cracked block be a sentimental reason?
All we got to lay out is the storage fee.
You've got the money.
I've got the money.
All finished.
- Shine?
- No, thanks.
You want a personally conducted tour of Puerto Vallarta?
I'll show you plenty good time.
- What do you think, Pete?
- It's not in the budget. - No, thanks, son.
- Okay, where do you want to go?
Paco show you, free on the house.
Taller Mecánico, Avenida...
"Cárdenas." No problem.
I'll show you exactly.
I like Americans.
Americans very smart people.
Someday, I go to America.
When you do, you look up Pete Stanchek.
He'll put you up, show you all the best ice cream parlours in town.
That sounds good.
You see down there? That's "Avenue Cárdenas."
Turn left, that way.
Go two blocks, you'll find "mecánico."
Thanks.
"De nada," anytime.
Welcome to Puerto Vallarta.
See you later, alligator.
Cute kid, know what I mean?
Well mannered.
Polite.
Didn't have his hand out.
An endangered species.
That light area, around four o'clock.
I can see it.
And you say this is Inca?
You're the expert.
You tell me.
Did anyone else spot this?
They were looking for oil.
And where is this?
In the jungles.
South America.
Mr Shepard, there's nothing to be gained by our playing games.
This could very well be an undiscovered Inca city.
And you know what that means.
Pre-Columbian artefacts.
And gold, Mr Prindle.
And what do you want?
Cash, and plenty of it.
'Cause they're gonna throw the key away if they find us stealing that stuff.
Yeah, it's a national treasure or something.
Is there another print of this?
That's it.
Gentlemen... we're in business.
There's gotta be some mistake.
No, "señores." No, "señores." This is not a mistake.
This is "Señor" Douglas' car.
And you're telling me that this thing won the Monte Carlo Grand Prix?
That is what "Señor" Douglas told me.
He say he would have won the Baja race too.
But his girlfriend... did not make the curve.
Herbie, he see it.
He stop.
He no finish the race.
"Señor" Douglas say, "It's here."
Let's turn it over.
Okay, so it runs.
Let's take it.
If nothing else, it's transportation home.
Mind if we take it around the block first?
Cute kid, huh?
Doesn't have his hand out.
He doesn't have it out because it's in your pocket.
You check that side.
See if you can find us a taxi.
- I'll get you a taxi, "señor."
- Get lost, kid.
Taxi!
All right. 12 o'clock, the National Hotel bar.
I'll be there.
- Carry your bag, "señor?"
- Move along, sonny.
No trouble, I carry your bags very cheap.
Put the bags...
I said put the bags down!
Hey, kid, come on!
Get away from me, will you?
Taxi.
Very sorry, "señores." Please, you forgive me.
He said he liked Americans, - then put his arms around us...
- And took us to the cleaner's.
Never mind re-enacting the crime.
Just look for the little...
There!
See that grubby little foot out behind that box?
A cold beer says it's attached to Paco the Dip.
Come back here, you little bandit!
- We need that worse than you do.
- Don't scare him.
Talk nicely.
I'm sorry, lady.
We're looking for a little kid.
Did you see a little kid?
I'm sorry.
Me too, lady.
You look that way.
- What took you so long?
- It's not easy in this town.
Mr Prindle, if you want to get in touch with me before, you can use this number.
- My wallet's gone.
- Have you left it up in the room?
It was that kid.
That crummy little kid!
I don't know.
He must have skipped town.
Oh, no, he didn't.
This time, we sack him.
You take him low, I'll take him high.
- Oh no, you don't.
- Is that yours?
No. Is it ours?
Sí. Grab loose of that.
Looks like that's all he got.
I'll take over, dipstick.
I ought to tan your bottom.
Oh, I got money.
Look.
