... where the final lumbering remnants of the ice Age the massive and awe-inspiring glaciers calve cathedral-sized icebergs into the sea where nature's bounty unfolds in a panoply of flora and fauna the like of which is seen nowhere else on the planet.
From the ocean depths, plumbed by ageless cetaceans to azure skies, where the mighty eagle soars. This land abounds with creatures great and small, strange and majestic.
It is a land steeped in tradition its mists redolent of the hearty souls of men who have gone to sea.:
Tlingit and Haida Inuit and Aleut Russian and Norwegian.
Their languages and deeds Iingering on in the names of our countless islands and passageways.
A land that has lifted its siren call to the bold and adventurous to those willing to risk their lives for the promise of untold fortune be it from fur, fin, from the heaven- pointing spires of old-growth spruce or from the buried treasures of gold or black energy-rich petroleum.
A land visited each year by the relentless and mysterious salmon.
Each river and stream welcoming home the king and sockeye.... --the coho and dog, pink or humpback which is smashed into cans and quick-cooked to give the colourful local folks something to do other than play cards and scratch their nuts all day.
A land where that nice old lady from Fort Lauderdale who had the stroke three cabins down was probably parked next to the thawed-out halibut you'll eat tonight while your floating hotel chugs through the Hecate Strait to deliver its precious load of geriatrics to the hungry Visa-card-accepting denizens of our northernmost and most mosquito-infested state!
So?
What's " redolent"?
Having or emitting an odour.
You mean people wanna come here because of the smell?
Pleasantly fragrant!
-Not talking about this place.
-Damn right!
Soon as they close this down, they'll turn it into a tourist attraction!
They'll disinfect the joint, and you can get a job in one of those cases.
Like in a museum.
One of those displays.
Dioramas!
Dioramas.
In that diorama they'll hang fake fish guts all over you, put a label underneath:
"Typical Filipino Cannery Worker" !
Probably pay better than this.
I'll be out on the water in my boat and every time I make a set there'll be a floating nursing home with 500 sons of bitches and their cameras capturing the moment.
And what boat is this?
My boat.
You don't have a boat, honey.
Remember?
Oh, yes, I do.
I'm getting it back today.
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?
Nice uniform.
The bride's parents wanted uniforms.
I look stupid.
You look like an angel.
I look like a little white maggot.
-Would you like one?
-Thank you.
How come you don't have to wear one?
This is the unemployed pulp mill worker's uniform.
Right.
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?
-No, thanks.
-I'll have one.
You gotta look at the big picture.
You clear-cut the trees, what do you have?
Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of timber.
Yeah, but it's ugly.
The point is to try to get the trees down without spending a fortune.
You're thinking short-term.
My mother told me, "You don't shit in your front yard."
-Your mother said that?
-Constantly.
Look, our people cruise by an island.
They got their binoculars out, the ones that can still see.
What do we show them?
We show them a little lndian fish camp, some totem poles maybe.
A black bear foraging for breakfast in the early morning mist.
We do not show them deforested hillsides and logging equipment, Phil.
Heavy machinery they see in New Jersey.
The timber industry has a right to make a living.
We all have to make our living. I'm not arguing that.
Cut the trees in the lnterior.
Turn it into a parking lot.
Just quit with the chain saws when you get to where people can see.
We're trying to develop themes for each area up here:
"The Whales' Causeway."
" Island of the Raven People."
" Kingdom of the Salmon." " Lumberland."
That's us.
That's a turn-of-the-century sawmill and a gift shop.
That's history, not industry.
History is our future here, not our past.
She looks like a million bucks, doesn't she?
Beautiful.
Would you like some more?
No, thanks.
Could you find the girl with the shrimp and send her this way?
It's like these kayak outfitters.
I know the jellybean colours are easy to spot if there's trouble but it spoils the ambience.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Today is a special day for me. I know it's a special one for all of you too.
This is my last appearance with Randy Mason and the Pipeline.
I'll be continuing my run as a solo performer at the Golden Nugget.
Randy will be rapidly sinking back into the relative obscurity he so richly deserves.
The time we've spent together has seemed much longer than it probably was.
And with that in mind, I'd like to dedicate this next song to him.
Fellas.
Room 16
The Palms Motel
I can rest behind that door
My life with you's become a living hell
Don't wanna live like that no more
And whatever it will take
I will do to make this
Final break
Better off without you
Better off without you
In my life
I'll show up with a lawyer.
You threatening us with a lawyer?
In schools now, when they teach contracts, you know who they use?
Francine here, that's who.
She wrote the fucking book!
It's not exactly a textbook, Louise.
I, on the other hand, am a criminal attorney.
Some of the business practices you engaged in--
That's bullshit!
You see two dykes wander up here from Seattle, you figure:
" Here's easy pickings" !
When we bought these properties, which you'd run into the ground--
That's not true!
When we bought them from you promises were made about plumbing, about dry rot.
I had a cash-flow situation.
Promises which you didn't keep!
I gave you my boat!
Yes, as collateral.
It's worth more than those repairs.
It's worth relatively little. We've had it appraised.
I gave you my license.
But, Harmon, the problem is, we are not fishermen.
Exactly.
So I take my boat, I go out, I make my limit.
I give you the money.
I get my boat back.
Wait a minute. We paid the docking fees all winter.
We had the engine overhauled.
And now that there's fish again you think you can waltz in here take our boat, Harmon, our boat, as if you still owned it?
As if you never defaulted on any of this?
You're worse than a fucking bank.
If we let you treat us like this, what does that say to everybody?
-" Don't take these women seriously." -You come here.
You bust people's balls--
Your balls are busted because you put them in a vise and yanked the handle.
-The screw.
-What?
The jaws of a vise are moved by a screw or a lever.
You don't call it a handle.
Thank you, Louise.
The point being, Mr. King if you are feeling pressure on your testicles, you have yourself to blame.
You're just gonna take the hit?
You're gonna let my boat rot in the harbour?
You misrepresented the properties to us.
You tried to swindle us into keeping your boat from being repossessed by assigning the title to us.
You gals already said you're not fishermen.
But there's no shortage of guys who are willing to work for a piece.
A share.
What?
On a boat, you know, in nautical terms, it's called working for a "share."
Thank you.
If we're gonna do this, we have to get our terminology right.
You think you'll get anybody in town to take my boat out and fish on my license?
You're both fucking crazy.
Better off without you
In my life
Is this your truck?
You working here?
I gotta load this wine off. Gotta help tear things down after.
Could you give me a ride?
Yeah, I guess.
After I....
-How far is it?
-Just into town.
Whenever you're ready.
I'm ready now.
-Aren't you the singer?
-Well, I was.
You're really good.
Thanks.
I just broke up with a guy, and he's here.
And if I'm gonna keep my shit together, I need to go now.
I'll wait here.
Yeah, I'll just....
I meant what I said before.
You're really good, singing.
Thanks.
Especially since I've never heard of you or anything.
Do you watch sports?
Yeah, basketball.
There must be players who are really good that you've never heard of.
Nope.
No, if they're professionals and they're really good, everybody's heard of them.
Well, singing is different.
It's a matter of taste luck, whatever.
You okay?
Couldn't be better.
Your boyfriend was the guy in the band, Randy....
Mason.
Well, I never heard of him either.
Good.
Take a left here.
When we came up to this country 1 5 years ago Margie was 8 years old and convinced we would all be eaten by grizzlies.
So far none of us has lost anything but the occasional backpack to the bears.
And this has been for us, like for so many people before a land of opportunity, a land--
There's just a couple more things.
I thought this was your house.
See if he can survive without the fucking microwave.
You taking his stuff?
My stuff. My daughter's stuff.
You sure?
Look around you.
You see everything that looks like shit?
That looks like somebody with no taste and bad personal hygiene would have?
That's his stuff.
Would you grab the other end of that?
How long did you live here?
Three weeks.
I used to gig with him in Spokane.
He had this anorexic girl singer who'd get too shaky to go on, so I'd fill in.
My booker talks me into doing a year up here.
You know, "The money's real good."
I bump into Randy in Sitka, and we hit it off.
So you move in.
No, I told him, " Keep your distance.
I got a kid.
I'm older than you are.
I don't smoke as much dope as you do.
So don't think I'm moving in or anything."
So how does your stuff end up in his place?
Unforeseen circumstances.
You married?
Live with somebody?
Nope.
Sorry.
You work for those two?
Franny and Zooey?
Frankie and Lou?
Yeah.
What'd you do before this?
Pulp mill, till it closed.
And before that?
This and that, like everybody.
Fisherman.
Yeah, I was.
Did you like it?
While it lasted.
You don't go out anymore?
Why not?
Unforeseen circumstances.
I should get back.
Let's move it off the truck.
The guys inside will help me.
You're gonna stay here?
We were before.
This is my regular gig for the next month or so.
Well, I'll come see you, then.
Sing.
Great.
My kid is gonna kill me.
It went fine.
The father was gonna cater it on the ship till the bride put her foot down.
You out of here?
Time off for good behaviour.
Saw all the groom's buddies checking you out.
Right.
I'm serious.
Bunch of preppy thugs.
You're a hard woman to please.
Catch you tomorrow.
You need a ride?
You know what they wanna bring? Frankie and Lou?
-What?
-Alpacas.
For sweaters?
For hiking trips.
They wanna take people out for a week or so and have the alpacas carry the gear.
They do it on the Amazon.
The Andes.
The Amazon's a jungle river. It'd be too hot.
It's probably the mountain range, the Andes.
Whatever.
They get them up here, no way I'm cleaning their cages.
These are some strange people we work with.
I don't know....
We got the lesbo trail guides, the human pincushion in the kitchen.
Rusty.
He looks like he took a staple gun to his eyebrows.
We got Eunice, the cashier:
26 years old and still lives with her mother.
We got the handyman there, killed two people.
He what?
Joe Gastineau?
Mr. Dark and Moody.
He killed people?
Got them killed.
Same thing.
Took them out on his boat, and they both drowned.
How'd you like to carry that around with you?
I'm sorry you got stuck at work. I just had to get out of there.
I'm used to getting home on my own. I just like to know where it is.
Half my clothes are missing.
Well, I grabbed everything I could see.
-I had a load in the dryer.
-We'll get it back.
I didn't wanna move over there in the first place.
It was a dumb idea, and I'm sorry.
He wasn't that bad.
Compared to what?
-Compared to Lyle. -He Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken.
Now look, I made a mistake with Randy, and I'm sorry.
I'll help you get your stuff.
You're the mistake.
Your ladies did a really nice job with that reception.
I didn't eat, but it looked really good.
Is the boy that likes you the one with the shrimp and the hair in his eyes?
I didn't say he likes me.
I said I thought he was good-looking.
And no, that's not him.
That's Perry.
Perry wants to be a break dancer when he grows up.
I thought that was over.
Disco hasn't made it up here yet.
Come on.
How could you think I think Perry is cute?
You're a high school kid.
What do I know what you like?
Right.
You don't.
Are you mad at me about Randy?
Did you like him?
It's hard enough to keep their names straight!
Don't be that way!
I feel like shit!
I could use a little support.
That's what therapy's for.
We're gonna have to rent the VCR again.
He's back.
There's nothing we can do about it.
He'll make a feud out of this thing with his boat.
Our boat.
Doesn't he have a job?
If the temperature in the water changes a couple of degrees it becomes slightly more or less acid.
Any little change, it can mean the salmon won't return there.
And where do they go?
They probably just keep looking along the coast until....
So the whole run disappears?
It's been known to happen.
Pretty hard-wired, fish.
Not many options.
People, though, got bigger brains.
They can guess at the future, make decisions.
They just do a real lousy job of it.
I hate it when they're stranded out in the air.
Their gills are working, they have that desperate look on their face.
Well, they're drowning.
In air.
What do you think it feels like to drown?
I don't know.
Never had the experience.
Blow it out!
Five more!
Four three two one. Both hands!
Here we go!
Keep those knees going!
Now reach and pull it down!
Strong arms!
Well that's all she wrote.
They say the Chinese might buy it.
Pack it all up, ship it over.
They can have it.
Who wants a drink?
This is the Golden Nugget Saloon, founded back in 1 881 when Port Henry was the gold-mining centre of the Northern Territory.
They say nobody eats canned salmon anymore.
Do you eat it?
Why would I want canned when I can get fresh?
People in Peoria are saying the exact same thing.
The only recorded bout between a domesticated wolf....
He's in that little DeHaviland of his doing his usual rap about the wilderness and the glaciers....
Think you're the only person up here out of a job?
Trying to impress these two girls.
He's still got his wheels down.
I drop these people off the boat.
He's a bigtime corporate executive.
He's with his second wife and two kids from the first marriage.
Those wheels dig in.
He flips tail over head.
They got heated tents, freeze-dried gourmet dinners.
They're wearing about $4000 worth of Gore-Tex.
The Beaver's lying belly up in the channel.
The two girls are unconscious.
He's hanging upside-down, hooked in by his belt, water coming from all sides.
Two hours they lasted.
And the exec gets me on the radio, saying....
Head-on into some other bozo in a Piper Cub whose eyes are also down on water.
It's so cold, your spit's frozen solid before it even hits the ground.
And the metal has that tinny sound when you slam the door like the thing's gonna shatter.
There haven't been shootings.
Can't see the front of my plane, this fog's so thick.
Harvest the resources, my ass.
A man goes out, he makes a set and he catches fish, goddamn it!
He's not a goddamn farmer!
There's mountain peaks all around me.
The Russians, the Japanese scooping up our crab.
But it's been the setting for many a confrontation.
Long time no see.
Smilin' Jack.
What brings you down this altitude?
Flew some medical supply salesmen in from Cordova.
There's a thousand of them at the Convention Centre.
Where are you living these days?
Two steps ahead of the finance company.
I'll see you later.
-Jumpin' Joe Gastineau.
-Friend of yours?
Not exactly.
You gassed her up
You're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one ln your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
Got paid on Friday
Your pockets are jinglin'
And then you see the lights You get all a-tinglin'
'Cause you're cruisin' with a six
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
Mind if I sit?
No, please.
Thanks.
So....
You're terrific.
Who do I remind you of?
Remind me of?
Singers.
Most people go, "You remind me of Judy Collins, but your voice is deeper Emmylou Harris, but your hair is curlier."
Screamin' Jay Hawkins.
Really?
No, I think he usually wore a bone in his nose.
So can you make a living doing this?
Sort of.
You make a living working for the lodge ladies?
Sort of.
It can be nice.
One summer, I did a cruise ship in the Caribbean.
I got to take my daughter.
You take her with you?
Pretty much, yeah.
Her father is...?
Out of the picture.
It was his choice.
So you've sung in a lot of places?
Thirty-six states and the territory of Puerto Rico.
How about you?
I've been to Seattle a couple of times and Canada, along the coast.
But you must like it?
I don't think I'd do so well down south. You know, cities.
How come you're not married?
-Sorry.
-You know....
If you don't wanna say....
Probably the same reason you're not married.
Because such a high percentage of men are jerks?
Because women are scarce and winters are long?
That's true, but....
You're looking for someone who understands your bullshit but is still crazy about you anyway?
That's a bit much to ask for.
No, it's not.
So have you, like, recorded songs?
I've made demos.
And I'm not exactly up here to be discovered, or anything.
You know, at my age it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, my so-called career.
So why do you still do it?
Almost every night it doesn't matter where I am or what song I'm singing all of a sudden, I'll hook into it.
I'll be feeling whatever it is the song is about.
And I can hear it.
I can feel it in my voice.
And I know that I'm putting it across.
Moments of grace.
Do you know what I'm saying?
I do.
I put my kid through a lot, though.
Moving all the time.
But when I take a straight job, bank teller, waitressing, whatever I feel so defeated, I don't even want her to look at me.
Would you like to do something?
"Something"?
It's real pretty country here. I could take you....
I gotta warn you.
What's the thing with the long skinny boats?
Kayaking.
I don't do that one.
Or anything where if the spike comes out of the cliff, you plunge to your death.
Climbing.
In general, things where you wear gear instead of clothing, I don't do.
It's good to know.
What do you...?
When you're not working...?
I read a lot.
A lot, yeah.
I go to the gym, punish myself on the treadmill.
If I'm with a guy, I make pathetic attempts at ingratiating myself often involving cooking and cleaning activities.
When my daughter was little, I would do stuff with her.
You don't anymore?
No.
So if you're willing let's work on this "doing stuff" idea.
You think of stuff, and I'll think of something.
But keep trying, really. Okay?
I will.
You know where to find me.
Two shows nightly. Bye.
It was called "Gold Fever."
In 1 897, the first wave of fortune seekers swept through Port Henry on their way to Skagway, the Chilkoot Pass and the Yukon gold fields.
They were desperate men willing to perish in search of one big strike every prospector dreamed of.
It could be the entire cruise, or you may work just one leg lay over at a stop and switch to a different ship.
How much time would I spend at home?
We like to think of our vessels as a kind of home.
Not much, huh?
We have this job for you.
It's different.
-We have this ship--
-Boat.
We have this boat.
The Raven.
We had the engine overhauled, put a new gill net drum on it.
Harmon King's boat.
It's our boat now.
-He gave us his license.
-His entry permit.
Just to make up for some of the money he still owes us.
We want you to go out.
To go out?
Go out and fish.
I'm not a fisherman.
Well, you used to be, right?
I mean, you know what you're doing on a boat.
I suppose.
So you could, if you wanted to.
Yeah, if I wanted to.
We could figure out some kind of percentage deal.
We don't know if we wanna keep it.
With the season almost over, and the license so expensive--
You're not tight with Harmon, are you?
Not especially, no.
If you could just go down to the marina, look it over.
Tell us if you need anything to make it operational.
I haven't been commercial fishing for 25 years.
Has it changed that much?
Well, more technology, but I just....
You're bailing us out.
It's a matter of credibility.
If we let people walk all over us--
I'll have to think about it.
Think about it.
Go down, look at the ship-- the boat figure out who you'd like to have for your crew.
You think people'd do that, knowing that it's Harmon's boat?
You can always get somebody.
If there are any calls for me, anybody comes by asking if I'm here just say I'm not registered, okay?
I'm trying to surprise somebody. I don't want word to get around.
You get points for originality.
You're the first guy that's ever asked me to watch fish thrash around and die.
-Well, it's--
-No, I'm not complaining.
I think it's cool.
I've seen it on TV, but in person like this, it's....
They're so beat-up looking.
Well, they stop eating when they head in.
My daughter did that for a while.
Almost had to put an IV in her.
Jesus, it's relentless, isn't it?
They don't stop.
Well, some of them do.
They just wear out and give up.
I'd make it.
Yeah, no sweat.
I do this much at the gym every day.
I'm gonna be gone for a couple of days.
It's sort of a job, you know, a favour.
When I get back, it'd be great to see you again.
That's all?
Your boat, Mr. Gastineau, is a very unusual property.
Look, I don't wanna sell it. I just want a mortgage.
But in view of your past financial difficulties....
That was San Diego.
A poor credit rating is a poor credit rating. It's going to follow you wherever you go.
It's just out there waiting. Waiting for the chance to fuck you over.
-You personally?
-Whoever.
One second, you're skimming along the surface, not a care in the world then one thing goes wrong.
Yeah, like Rudy Bannister.
Rudy Bannister?
He's up in the fjord longlining when the front of the glacier breaks off.
It makes this wave four or five stories high by the time it hits his boat.
It's gone.
And Sonny McCarthy.
Gets caught in the riptides, trying to short cut through Rimski Channel.
They hit the rocks.
Two guys stay onboard, two guys jump.
Sonny and the other guy stayed onboard, bought it.
-Luck.
-Luck, nothing.
The ocean wanted them.
Hell, I'm glad I'm not going out there no more.
It could be quick, like that deadhead that Tommy Grogan hit.
It punched through his bow and sunk him in five minutes.
Or it can sneak up on you when you're not even looking.
Like Joe Gastineau.
Fuck.
Ever a guy had the world by the balls, it's Joey.
The basketball player?
He was headed for a full scholarship, some university in California.
Senior year, he blows out his knee.
Kiss that goodbye.
Had a jump shot that'd make you weep.
So he gets on one of Torgeson's crab boats up north back when that was a fucking gold mine.
Makes enough to put a down payment on this little gillnetter the Arctic Dawn.
Gets some friends, Lester Pope, who used to work with his father and this kid, Oley.
Jack Johannson's brother.
He'd never been out fishing.
He's like a high-school buddy.
Played hoop with Joe.
They were gonna go out with Joe and make a big score.
I was crewing on the Cape Fox then.
We hooked into this run.
We were barely moving.
It was flat calm, no tide.
We were picking fish as fast as we could to keep the net wet.
By nightfall, we were all plugged, waiting in line at the tender.
About six boats ahead of us, maybe eight behind, Joey's on the end.
It was party time.
Everybody that wasn't unloading drops anchor, and they start boat-hopping.
So about 1 , 2 in the morning, Joe gets back on his outfit.
Him and the Johannson kid, they go below to sleep it off.
And Lester racks out on deck.
It would be morning before the tender could get to them anyway.
Maybe the boat was out of the water too long. You get cracks, things dry up.
Or they were so plugged, the water line rose up to where it'd never been before.
Whatever.
Without a sound, the boat fills like a sponge and sinks in 30 seconds.
So Joey wakes up, it's pitch-black.
He's underwater, right?
He's upside-down, completely disoriented.
Swims out through the galley, yells loud enough to wake me up on the Cape Fox.
We fished him out okay, but the other two, not a trace.
Lost.
Yeah, he lost his friends he lost the catch, there's no insurance on the boat.
And Joe....
Joe's not the same guy.
I already got you one.
How'd you guess?
I've been keeping my eye on you.
I like your singing.
Thanks.
You really class up this joint.
I've played worse.
Jack Johannson.
I've been warned.
A lot of formerly married women took flying lessons from you.
A lot of formerly married women are suing me for alimony.
I'm thinking of getting out of the bush pilot game.
Find something more lucrative.
Let's see.... Fast-food service?
Camp counsellor?
You live around here?
No.
One-year tour of the frozen north.
Out on your own?
No, I'm hooked up with a guy.
Musician?
He's a fisherman.
Oh, my God!
He shot a fish.
Shot it?
A halibut. It was like a gangland execution.
We could use some halibut.
When's Joe getting in?
Joe, are you home?
But he still works here?
On and off.
He's out on a fishing boat now.
Fishing? Joe?
Can I tell you about our specials?
What are you buying when you get on a roller coaster?
Not risk, because only fringe consumers want that, but the illusion of risk.
Being hurled to the edge of danger, but knowing that you never have to cross it.
Mr. Disney's innovation was to put these rides and attractions into a story context. You imagine yourself a character in his cartoon as you floated through a plaster of Paris jungle.
The obvious next step, and this is at the core of our proposal is not bigger and better facsimiles of nature but nature itself.
Think of Alaska as one big theme park.
How'd we do?
Got a couple boatloads.
In three days?
They were running pretty good.
I kept a few out for the restaurant.
Oh, my God!
That's gorgeous!
That's great!
-Bobby!
-Jesus look at this.
You're all where I left you six years ago.
Same barstools and everything.
Hey, Harm.
Aud, you're looking good.
Somebody come in and dust you off once a week?
How's the charter business?
I can't complain.
I'm thinking of bringing my Glacier Bay clients here.
"See Port Henry's wax museum.
Incredibly lifelike figures posed in various stages of drunken stupor."
Set up a round for these characters, Vic.
Just come up from Baja chitchat the clients, lay on the cerveza, harass the whales.
You like that?
I like not freezing my nuggets off here all winter waiting to see who blows their brains out first.
You know Roscoe Karnes?
Roscoe with the voice box?
Blew his brains out February.
I rest my case.
Vic, I heard my brother's been coming in here.
Fucking sellout!
He's over in the corner here, Bobby.
Jumpin' Joe, the man himself.
Hey, bro.
Heard they shut the pulp mill down.
Town smells better.
They said you were working for a couple of button nibblers at Harm's old lodge.
How you been?
Terrific.
Just terrific.
I just took a National Geographic crew out to do a piece on the sea lion rookery before I come up.
I get a lot of repeat customers, and computerized my navigation....
Teresa?
Teresa and the kids are cool.
Joaquin starts kindergarten this year.
Great.
Listen, someone said that you were out fishing.
Frankie and Lou, they got a boat, they got a license.
They asked me to go out, so....
Back in the saddle.
So to speak.
Sorry I couldn't make it for the old man.
No problem.
I had clients.
Hollywood real-estate honchos.
Yeah, well, you couldn't make it.
I didn't have a ceremony.
I did some paperwork and put up a headstone.
You got my check?
Yeah, thanks.
I called my mom to tell her about it.
How'd she take it?
Changed the subject.
Well, he was who he was.
Died in bed, man.
I always figured he'd freeze to death in the parking lot outside of some joint.
You know the laundromat at Wrangell?
Where there's a shower?
The guys coming off the boats?
About three years ago, I was in there. Got my soap, got my towel and back in the steam, I see this old guy.
I say, "That is one beat-to-hell human being."
The guy looks up and it's the old man.
That's the last time I saw him.
The Old Salt.
The Old Prospector.
I tell my clients stories about the old man.
Colourful shit. The tour guide part of the job.
How he lost those fingers, and how he, you know, survived the earthquake and all those tidal waves on that tender.
You heard them all.
The guy I was scared of when I was little-- Nobody wants to hear about him.
Nope.
I gotta ask you a favour.
Me?
-Have I ever asked you for anything?
-What is it?
Well, I got a situation.
It's a finesse thing with a client. I gotta pick him up at Skagway.
I need somebody to crew for me.
You always run your operation on your own.
It's just for appearances.
It's a business deal, see?
I gotta impress the guy, so I gotta look less like a captain and more....
Like an admiral.
Exactly.
It's a milk run, and since you're on the water again....
I've only gone out once.
Well, I can trust you.
I mean, this deal, this business deal, it's sensitive.
Word can't get out.
When would we go?
Day after tomorrow.
I just gotta put a couple things in motion.
I'll see if I can get off work.
You saved my ass, bro.
I appreciate it.
You and me, we're--
Practically strangers.
No, we're the Gastineau brothers, man.
Half brothers.
Right.
Listen, I gotta run, bro.
I'm on a schedule here.
I'm at the south marina.
The Orca Princess.
Sunday morning, 7 sharp, we catch the tide.
It'll be a blast.
Good evening.
I'm Donna De Angelo, and this is the Golden Nugget.
Well, I see some familiar faces out there.
Welcome back.
There's the tide.
Is it with you? Are you plowing into it?
ls it slack?
Where's the moon in its cycle?
There's wind.
It can jump on you when you're ducking in and out of the islands.
There's the size of the channel the configuration of the bottom....
You still know all this stuff?
Yeah, as much as you can know it.
This isn't what I expected.
What did you expect?
I don't know.
Some guys, they live alone, it can get....
I had the Health Department over this morning.
They sprayed the walls down.
You listen to a lot of different stuff.
That's good.
See a whole wall of the, you know, Butthole Surfers, it....
You read books.
So you're either a nice, quiet guy who lives alone, or you're a serial killer.
I mean, my track record for consciously choosing men is so horrendous that I.... If I ever hooked up with somebody good, it would be pure luck.
I'm being careful, okay?
Me too.
"'The Water Baby.'
The midwife knew at first look it wasn't a normal delivery.
The newborn was cold as it struggled and gasped--"
A little louder.
"The midwife knew at first look it wasn't a normal delivery.
The newborn was cold as it struggled and gasped in her arms wet and cold with a bluish pallor that didn't change once she cleared its throat with her finger.
It fought for air but didn't open its mouth.
The mother, sweat-soaked in her bed sheets the father, video camera dropping away from his apprehensive face her assistant, on the phone to the life-support unit all seemed to move in a heavy slow motion, as if underwater.
The midwife was halfway down the hall with the baby before she noticed them.
A tiny, half-moon slit below each ear lined with a deep crimson membrane.
Gills."
I never slept with a drummer.
Is that good?
Probably.
It probably indicates some level of self-respect I've never fallen below.
So ex-fishermen rate higher than drummers.
Certain types of fungus rate higher than drummers.
And what brings this up?
I don't know if my daughter's a virgin or not.
Is she going out with a drummer?
No, I was just....
I don't know.
Just thinking.
Well, have you asked her?
I don't wanna know that badly.
If I ask her if she needs underwear, she considers it invasive.
She's been a major baby-sitter since she was 1 3.
She wants her own money, her own room.
Independent.
You don't have any children, do you?
No.
But you were married.
I knew that.
It's a good thing you didn't have kids to fight over.
So?
When's the last time you were involved with someone?
About a year ago.
Someone from the pulp mill?
An aerobics instructor.
Not Corky.
You know her?
Yeah, she works at my gym.
So?
Who dumped who?
She thought I was too downbeat.
-She used that word?
-Among others.
Well, she's a real spark plug, that Corky.
I have to tell you something.
I'm allergic to wool.
Like in a carpet, even a blend.
So in blankets and clothing--
I can get rid of whatever.
No, you don't have to.
If you see me itching....
Well, no, it's no big deal.
I bought new sheets.
In case you came over.
Really?
So maybe this is a terrible idea.
Veto it if you want.
Some guy?
He's really nice.
They're all nice till you say they're scum and shouldn't be allowed walking the streets.
This'll be fun.
It's like a nature thing.
Oh, please.
You don't like him, you don't have to deal with him again.
It's my business.
Then why do I have to go?
Consider it a favour to me.
It's important he know you're more than a rumour.
I'd rather stay a rumour.
Anyhow, you already know him.
You work with him.
Joe Gastineau.
Is there some problem with him?
He seems really nice.
Is there something I should know about?
He's fine.
He's not the guy you like out there?
Honey.
Honey, he's my age. He's older.
What did you think could happen?
Nothing did happen, did it?
Give me a break!
Maybe this is good. Maybe it's a sign.
We don't usually like the same type guys.
If I knew you were interested in him....
But I didn't, did I?
You can be mad at me, but not that mad. Okay?
This isn't a willful boyfriend-swiping type of thing.
It's something different.
If you do this for me, I'll love you forever.
She's a good kid.
She's funny.
Really?
In a morbid kind of way.
So do you find her attractive?
I never thought about it much.
Well, she's a kid.
Will I sleep with you or with her?
It's up to you.
You two know each other.
I'm gonna go down below and get things squared away.
Some coincidence, huh?
So you like boats?
I don't know. Never been on them much.
Well, we're gonna cruise up north a ways and maybe see some whales, seals sea lions.
My mother hates boats.
Anything you do outdoors that's fun, she hates it.
And she's allergic to wool.
She told me.
You allergic to anything?
My mother's boyfriends.
It's terrific down there.
Yeah, Bobby's got a real nice operation going.
I love boats.
Hey, Joey.
Terrific. You made it.
Bobby, this is Donna De Angelo and her daughter, Noelle.
They're coming along for the first leg of the trip.
Great.
We'll take the scenic route.
Well, the first night, maybe you slap some water on your face...
Well, the first night, maybe you slap some water on your face take your clothes off, crawl under the sheets.
Seems like minutes before they yank you out of bed.
You pick the money fish out of the web, ice them down, make another set.
The next night, you maybe take your jacket off and sleep with your boots on, on top of the rack.
Third night, you might not make it below.
By the end of the week, you look for someplace safe to lean on and close your eyes for a few minutes.
I've slept on fish.
Sounds like hell.
Well, people get hooked on it.
God knows why.
It's the thing itself, you know?
You go out, you find the fish.
You pull them out of the ocean.
You're right there with it.
Everything else is secondhand.
People work in canneries.
People sell real estate, T-shirts.
What if you couldn't sing anymore?
What if you had to work, like, you know, in a record store?
So you liked it.
And it was dangerous.
And you got off on it.
Yeah, I guess I did.
Noelle is studying to be a nuclear physicist.
Very funny.
You could.
You're smart enough.
She's been in a new school every year.
But she's a good writer.
How would you know?
I've read your stories.
When I was 1 2.
You still write, don't you?
The weather service says we got a gale coming.
We're not gonna make it to the narrows.
Is that bad?
If we put in back here, the mountains will knock down a lot of the wind.
It's not a good anchorage.
-You've been in there?
-No.
Well, if we stay out here, we're gonna get hammered.
How's the kid?
Do you want some water? Rinse out your mouth?
We could try another one of those pills.
No, I'll be all right.
What are these cuts?
-These--
-They're just cuts!
"Just cuts"? How did they get there?
Maybe I got them at work.
People don't get cuts--
We'll pull into this inlet and drop anchor.
When it calms down, I'll throw on a couple of steaks.
Are you all right?
" Frosh Phenom Cans 30 in Overtime Upset."
"Soph Sensation Leads the Saint K-Cagers to the State Finals."
He's got those scars on his knees.
Jumpin' Joe Gastineau.
The " Houdini of the Hardwood," the " Beethoven of the Bank Shot."
So he was good?
John Wooden sent one of his scouts to look at him.
Is that someone I should know?
In basketball, it's like God sending the angel Gabriel to check out your moves.
Joey graduated, they retired his number, retired his locker bronzed all his old jockstraps stuck them in the trophy case.
High school.
The game's changed.
Now I'd just be another guy.
Right.
This tofu burger, how does she like it?
Mealy, medium-mealy or black and crispy?
I don't think she's very hungry.
When this was a territory, it would've been a hanging offense to eat bean curd.
She is picky about food.
If I scramble her an egg, she makes me feel like a criminal.
If your own kid can't make you feel like shit, what's the point?
No meat?
No meat, no fish, no dairy.
Food Nazi.
I could scrape the green stuff off the anchor chain, heat that up for her.
Listen.
You hear anything?
No.
Nobody comes back here.
I thought I heard a motor.
Listen, Joe, we got a problem.
I should've asked.
They're terrific.
But this guy I'm meeting....
Guys, actually.
What's going on?
It's complicated.
Tell me.
I was in a situation.
I invested in some real estate.
It didn't turn out well.
There was a cash-flow squeeze.
I had these clients. They owned an organic food business.
I took them from Baja to Glacier Bay.
They're high the whole time, but nice.
And at the end, we got along pretty good, and they gave me a bonus.
It's a pound of hash, right?
It's primo stuff.
They said if I wanted, if I was that kind of guy, how easy it would be to....
-Christ.
-They connected me with someone.
I brought up a couple of loads over the last few years.
It's a piece of cake.
The money gets me out of a jam.
It's just hash.
It's not crack or heroin.
You carrying drugs onboard?
No, Joe.
I'm not.
That's the problem.
The last time I'm up, off of Cape Caution a Canadian patrol boat comes racing after me.
I dump the whole batch.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
I get nervous, and it's fish food.
They had me confused with some other boat. Somebody reported them running too close to a pod of humpbacks.
These guys, Joey, I don't know that much about them, but they don't fuck around.
They think I sold it on the side, that I'm holding out.
We arrange a meet in Baja.
I get nervous again.
I smell a setup, I don't show.
I come up here, my home turf.
I contact them, arrange another meeting, tell them we'll work it out.
That's where we're headed?
I got it all worked out.
A payment schedule.
A mortgage on the boat, the house.
They'd rather get their money back, right?
These are businessmen.
What am I supposed to do?
I told Teresa, Joey.
She left me.
She took the kids, went across to Tijuana to her sister's.
You gotta help me out of this.
You don't tell me shit.
I gotta have somebody backing me up!
Just for them to see I got somebody behind me, I got family!
I mean, who else can I trust?
But the women....
We go by Tenakee Springs tomorrow.
We drop them off there.
They were gonna fly back anyway.
Have a plane pick them up there.
Stay up here. I'll figure out something to tell them.
You're saving my ass on this.
You don't deserve it.
I don't know. I just feel funny.
Not as funny as I'll feel sleeping in the same bed with you.
Come on. You used to all the time.
It wasn't that long ago.
It was that long ago.
It was in another lifetime.
It could be kind of fun.
If we weren't trying to impress some guy, we wouldn't even be here.
What do you mean, "we"?
You know what I mean.
There's no room, but come on in.
How you feeling?
A little better.
Good.
The wind's gone down, so it should be pretty calm.
Tomorrow, we're gonna swing over to Tenakee and drop you off there.
-What's that?
-A little town--
No, that upstairs.
Somebody come onboard?
What's happening?
All right, follow me.
Whatever happens, follow me.
Swim for shore!
They're up here, getting off the front!
Keep swimming.
Keep going. Keep going!
We've gotta get to the woods.
Come on.
Go up.
Up.
Up here.
What the fuck is going on? !
Somebody shot Bobby.
What?
Who shot him?
What?
Who shot him?
I don't know.
He told me he was in trouble just now.
What'll we do?
Take your clothes off.
What?
Get them off or you'll freeze.
-Hurry up!
-We have to get help!
There's nobody here!
Now help Noelle!
I'm cold.
If they come after us we're gonna have to move, so put your shoes back on.
I don't have any.
I don't believe this is fucking happening!
The night's short now.
We'll be all right.
Turn around.
Get your shirt off.
Scrunch down, scrunch down.
Rub her, rub her!
I can't breathe.
I can't move.
It's okay.
They're coming in.
Here. Get on my back.
Come on.
Get the clothes.
Hurry up!
The boats are gone.
Both of them.
Think they'll come back?
There's no way to know.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't have any idea till last night that something was wrong.
You think they killed him?
Where are we?
It's a little inlet on the back side of Kuleshov Island.
What's that? Like up Shit Creek without a paddle?
Yeah, pretty much.
Now, I think we should head towards the channel while it's still light, and hope we run into a stream.
We'll be okay for a few days without food, but water's....
Here, try this.
-What are you gonna use?
-Don't worry.
I'll just be careful where I step.
This is not happening to us.
It could be worse.
It's not that cold yet.
And I've got my knife.
Christ, wait a minute.
We can have a fire.
I'm not sure.
Smoke--
I'm not gonna let her freeze like that. Not again.
For white folks to leave the mainland, they usually had some kind of scheme.
People used to raise foxes for the pelts, you know.
It was a big deal for a while.
Watch yourself.
Why come out here?
Well, land was available, I guess.
They would hunt and fish and try to grow some things.
Over here!
Somebody lived here.
Tomorrow, they'll miss us.
Noelle won't be in class.
Nobody will miss me in school.
They'll miss you at your job. And Joe.
And I'm supposed to sing at the Nugget.
It'll be a few days before people start calling around for us.
Bobby wasn't keeping radio contact, so nobody knows he cut in over here.
How long does it take to starve?
I don't know.
Depends on, you know, what shape you're in, and what else you're doing.
You remember that fast that I did in Idaho?
How long was that?
You cheated.
I did not.
I had some tomato juice.
Then it isn't a fast.
Well, I'm starving now.
How long will it take us to get to the channel?
A couple days.
Maybe more.
Days?
I think we should hang here where we've got shelter for a while make sure those guys don't come back.
Then we can start a signal fire on the shore.
Do people come here to fish?
Nobody does anything on Kuleshov.
What about this stuff?
No, I don't think so.
That batch there, what you've got, that's good.
And you can look under the rocks for crabs.
When are we gonna light the signal fire?
I think we could risk it tomorrow.
Then we find a place that doesn't go under when the tide comes in.
"'My Diary."'
So are we gonna eat that thing too?
Sea cucumber.
Lots of protein.
Can you hand me some of that algae?
Sea lettuce.
Thank you.
These limpets taste like rubber.
Frankie steams them in white wine and ginger, on a bed of saffron couscous.
It's one of the appetizers.
I memorized them.
If we're here for a while, I'll rig something for cooking.
Sorry.
Here.
Chew this real slow.
" My name is Anne Marie Hoak, and this is my diary.
Papa and Mother and I have come here to make a go at the fox farming trade.
If this pans out, says Papa, next year I can go back to finish with school.
I offered to get on at the cannery to help out when we were in town but Papa says there's too much trash working there.
He was a logger, but fell while he was topping, and now has headaches and dizziness that prevent him from many of the trades other men pursue.
This way, he says, we can live in the great outdoors and operate our own business which is every man's true desire.
Mother doesn't care for it.
We have transported a dozen breeding pairs of blue pelt foxes and put them in their pens.
They're lovely to look at, but nervous and I need to mind my fingers when I'm near them.
When the vixens are ready to bear, we'll separate them to be with their litter.
Papa is building a fish trap in the stream as he hopes to catch the returning chum for fox food.
I expect it will be a hard life, but work is scarce back in town and Papa's spirit was getting low.
Mother goes on about how she'll miss female company and that I will have to be her special friend.
Papa thinks he's been a disappointment to her.
And sometimes she doesn't do much to hide it.
I'll be lonely here, I can tell, but it should be a great adventure like Caddie in Caddie Woodlawn.
I'll try to be a faithful writer, dear diary and tell you my innermost thoughts."
Read some more.
Tomorrow night.
We may not be here tomorrow.
I found it. I'll read it when I want to.
We'll have something to look forward to.
Like a soap opera.
Sounds like we're moving in.
There's no telling how long it's gonna be.
We're gonna be all right, aren't we?
We're gonna be fine.
Lester!
Oley!
Help!
Help, somebody, please!
Somebody help me!
Who the fuck is that?
Lester and Oley.
They're on the boat.
What boat?
Are you okay?
What's the matter?
You can't always save people.
We need to feed this a couple of times a day.
When the sky's like this, it won't be easy to spot.
But on a clear day....
So what if it rains?
Well, if it rains or the tide comes in too high, we'll start from scratch.
Then we hope that somebody sees this.
Somebody who doesn't wanna kill us.
It's a possibility.
Jeez, you two are a perfect match.
Doom and Gloom.
-There's no use pretending. -Yes, there is!
We're on a camping trip.
We're on a survival school camping trip.
This is what they call "quality time," isn't it?
This is what they mean.
No distractions, no media stuff.
We just get to know each other.
We gnaw the bark off a few trees.
People pay money to come on trips like this.
If you assume that bad shit's gonna happen, bad shit happens.
I just don't see the point.
The fish go in through here then they can't turn around and get out.
Well, that's the idea, anyway.
This wire's kind of brittle, though.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
My old man taught me.
You did lots of stuff with him?
When he had something to do and needed somebody to swear at, he took me along.
My father's a composer. My real father.
Really?
How long did you live with him?
I didn't.
She split up with him, you know, before....
Bobby was your half brother?
Did you ever live together?
We'd see each other around.
He was a lot younger.
Different friends, a different life.
I've got two half sisters and a half brother.
What are they like?
I never met them.
They're pretty little still.
I saw them in a picture.
He was in People magazine, my father.
So you don't visit?
She doesn't want me to.
You just write letters and phone calls?
You don't think we're gonna get rescued, do you?
"The house is small but cozy now that we have cleaned it up and made it our own.
I have my own room, and at night I hear the owls calling back in the woods and our foxes yipping when something wild comes by.
There are blueberries everywhere.
My fingers are stained purple with them.
Mother insists I'll be attacked by bears if I stray too far from the house.
Papa's headaches are better, and I help him clear the fish trap and prepare the food for the animals.
It is unpleasant, sticky work, but must be done.
I've gotten stronger handling the skiff.
Mom chides Papa for making a boy of me.
But I don't mind.
The days it doesn't rain are God's glory.
Most of our vixens are close to giving birth.
Some days, I'll go for hours without speaking, and feel I'm changing perhaps possessed by the soul of some long-dead Indian girl or perhaps the spirit of a she-wolf.
This morning, I snuck up on Papa felling a spruce for the fireplace and watched him for a long time without him seeing me.
Perhaps I shall learn to become invisible.
I made blueberry pancakes.
Mother says if she eats any more fish, she'll grow fins and swim back to town.
At night, she has me kneel with her to pray."
You gonna read us some more?
"The terrible birthing has begun.
We think one of the vixens ate her litter.
The kits, the ones that survived are lovely once their eyes are open.
Papa told me not to handle them, but when he is gone, I do.
Their heads are squarish and fluffy."
Fox babies.
Isn't that enough?
Don't want the bears to dig him out.
Sorry you had to see this.
Killing somebody for money.
By the middle of winter up here, people kill each other because they're bored.
Bobby took a risk, didn't work out for him, and that's all.
"Winter has locked us in its icy embrace.
The pelts of the animals are thick and bluish, our home is blanketed with snow.
Papa calls it 'Limbo, ' because it isn't heaven and it's too cold to be hell.
Mother wondered about purgatory, but he said no.
Purgatory has an end to it.
'Don't torture me so, ' said Mother.
The salmon we dried up has run out.
The kits are eating solid food now, and it's hard to keep up with them.
Papa went to the other side of the island and shot two sea lions.
He could only bring one back without tipping over in the skiff.
I had to help him with the crosscut saw breaking it down to pieces that we keep in the shed.
Papa said it's just meat, but I tried not to look at what I was doing.
When Papa rowed back, the other sea lion had been gotten to by a bear.
We put a piece of the frozen meat in each of the pens and the foxes fight over it and gnaw at it and the outside melts from the heat of their little tongues.
Mother won't deal with them anymore.
She has grown silent with the shorter, darker days and only now and again will she break out into one of her Bible songs.
She asks me to join her, but we don't harmonize well. "
" I have a dream about Fox.
He is a young man who comes to me on snowshoes, dressed in the blue pelts.
His skin and hair are dark, but his eyes are ice blue.
All the others here are paired, he says:
Papa and Mother.
The sires and the vixens.
But I am alone and he can't let that continue.
Sometimes in the dream he stays with us, but usually he picks me up and carries me to his own island.
Papa says if we can get the animals through the winter, they're a gold mine.
He says fortunes have been started on less.
He says if he keeps having his dizziness I'll have to go hunting with him the next time.
The burns from where Mother hit him with the bacon grease are only pink now healing, though the hair doesn't grow on that part of his jaw.
I'm sewing a sampler."
Don't worry about it burning.
Just flip it over after a minute.
Did you put the trap back?
Good.
Good day for planes.
Nobody's coming.
Don't be negative.
In two weeks, how many planes have we seen?
Zero.
We heard that one.
There'd be more if they were looking here.
What's that supposed to mean?
Bobby probably told people at the dock that we were headed in a different direction.
He thought people were after him.
People were after him.
Stupid.
Trying to impress your boyfriend, drag us out on a boat--
I'm cold, I'm hungry, I'm dirty and I'm scared shitless, just like you are.
-I'm trying to help us get through this.
-I shouldn't be here!
I shouldn't be in this state!
Nobody is to blame for this!
Yeah, right.
When you are of age, you're free to fuck up your own life but until that time, I'm afraid it's my job to do it for you.
You could help me with this.
He's not my father!
-Thank God!
-What's that mean?
He would've gone off picking berries.
That's the last we would've seen of him.
That's not true!
How do you know?
You were in the same room with him twice!
You wouldn't let him!
If he thinks of you once a year, I'd be surprised.
Every Christmas. He sent me a bike--
He sent me a watch, a dollhouse--
I sent the bike!
I sent the watch!
All of it.
When you were little, I figured you have the Easter Bunny, you have Santa Claus.
You should have a father in California that sends you stuff.
I hated that dollhouse.
I know you did, sweetheart.
But you wouldn't let me exchange it because it was from him.
"I was the one who found them.
It was time to clean the scat from the pens so I had the buckets and the shovels.
And then there was blood everywhere in the snow.
All of them torn and smashed, even my little kits.
A bear, says Papa.
Though when has a bear gone into a half a dozen pens without breaking the gates?
Mother says nothing.
But she's only a black spot these days and refused to celebrate Christmas.
I dreamed that Fox came and was angry for what we let happen that he held me down on the snow, and I felt his hot breath on my face felt it bitter in my throat and felt his ice eyes cutting into me.
I wish I wish he would come soon.
Mother sleeps with me now, and it is cramped and tense.
You would think that another body under the covers would bring warmth but I awake feeling drained, like she's pulled all the heat from me.
I'm doing the cooking now, and my eyes are always red from the smoke.
The wood is too big for the cook stove but the ax has gone missing, and we can't break it down.
Mother says hell is a cold place.
Maybe I'm the soul not of a she-wolf but of a soaring bird that flies south every winter.
And my heart is so sick because I'm not supposed to be here in this cold this dark, this wet.
Maybe I'm like the air in this house the air that doesn't move when Papa and Mother pass in silence.
Dead smoky air that smells of wool and old bacon.
We threw the animals on the rocks for the tide to deal with.
Papa cried."
They're coming!
They're coming!
Careful!
You folks picked a hell of a place for a clambake.
We've been stranded.
Any more of you?
No, it's just us.
We were on Bobby's boat, and he was murdered.
I'm not sure who did it.
We jumped off at night.
A couple fellows came looking, then we hid.
Then they pulled anchor.
Damn.
How long you been here?
A week and a half.
We've been living in an old house, holing up there at night.
And I was hoping you people could help me.
My radio's shot.
I'm low on fuel and heading into bad weather.
Your radio's gone?
Crapped out on me a half-hour ago.
Not even static.
I'll have to turn this thing around, try to get out of here, send help.
Would you take my daughter? She's sick.
I'd love to, but I can't handle the weight.
She barely weighs a thing.
I've barely got a fighting chance as it is.
Sorry, ladies.
Here.
You wanna help me with this thing?
I got a first-aid kit in here.
No food, though.
I'm real sorry to hear about Bobby, man.
I used to party with him up in Haines.
What's the story, Jack?
What's what story?
Who sent you?
Just one more night out here, honey.
And then they'll come back and get us.
Couple of guys, Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown.
Never seen them before, but I don't think they're here to save the whales.
They laid some money on me to see if I could spot three people in the boonies.
And if you saw them?
Just go back and tell them where.
So why'd you land?
I'm on the level about the radio, Joe.
I hoped to find some fishermen with a shortwave and a cooler full of brew.
If I'd have known the deal about Bobby, I'd have turned them in.
You have to trust me on that one.
Hang in there, ladies.
I'll be back with the cavalry tomorrow.
We're gonna make it.
Last I heard, he was flying out of Anchorage kicking square halibut out of a cargo plane.
What's that?
Marijuana bales.
You fly over a spot on the water.
Somebody signals you with lights or a code over the radio.
You dump them, and people down below fish them out, take them to the next stage.
He's a drug dealer.
He's whatever pays best, or what he can get away with.
He hit on me a couple of times at the bar.
He seemed like a nice guy.
I'm not saying people don't like him.
I'm just saying I don't trust him.
You think he might tell those men?
I don't know.
I don't believe him about the radio.
And we've got some personal history.
Like what?
His brother drowned on a fishing boat, and it was my fault.
He wouldn't do that to us.
He's not a killer.
How do you know?
I've looked in his eyes.
I can tell some things about a person.
Look, we don't have any choice!
You're sick.
It's getting colder.
We can't stay here!
Nobody's gonna show up for a while if it keeps up like this.
Not in a plane, not in a boat.
It's got to stop sometime.
Sooner or later.
Humour me, okay?
All right, it was worse yesterday and the day before.
The signal fire's probably out.
As soon as it clears, we'll get it going.
It's blank.
What is?
It's blank.
Look, after the first few entries....
The foxes haven't even had their babies yet.
"We won't bury her on the island.
She made me promise.
She whispered it, and she hissed it in my ear one night when she laid hard beside me in bed.
'Promise me.'
She wouldn't listen to anything else.
We had come back from looking for deer, Papa and me.
Signs at the salt lick, but nothing to shoot at.
I was putting his rifle back where he hid it in the shed roof when I heard him cry out.
He wouldn't.... He wouldn't let me in at first though I hollered and struck at the door.
He opened up when he'd got her down on the table but I still saw the black mark around her neck where the cord was.
The fire had gone out so our breath was showing, Papa and me.
White long sighs of grief.
And her mouth open and hair crispy to the touch.
We wrapped her in her afghan and then I I got the fire going while Papa just sat.
Nothing to say.
Later, we found the note and she told how the animals were Satan's handmaidens and how their sharp little eyes would not give her peace.
So she killed them and then threw the ax in the woods.
'We have looked into ourselves,' she wrote 'and what is there condemns us.'
We'll take her off the island come first thaw.
If Fox comes padding through the trees he will find us gone."
That's it?
That's it.
The last entry.
Poor thing.
Who?
Little Anne Marie there.
Her mother didn't love her enough to stick around.
She was crazy.
But still....
She left her daughter.
I would never do that.
No matter what.
I kind of look forward to her being sick.
It's the only time she lets me hold her anymore.
It's some kind of fever.
It's in her lungs.
We have to get her out of here.
You really think he might bring people back to kill us?
I hope I'm wrong.
If....
When we get back, I still have some dates up north.
I'd only be gone for--
She could stay with me.
And so could you.
You're not sick of us?
You're not sick of me?
There's nobody I'd rather be stranded in desperate circumstances with.
We should take our time with the furniture moving part.
You know, she pretends not to but she gets her hopes up for me.
I'll take care of her.
There it is.
Looks bigger.
Room for all of us.
Or those men.
To hell with it.
I'm not staying here.
Jackson came over to play.
Superheroes.
I was Black Power Ranger.
He was Batman.
- Jake, you okay in there, buddy?
Can I ask you a question?
Okay, time to hit the sack.
- An important question.
- Here we go, big guy. Come on.
- Can I wear bugs?
- Bug pajamas are all the way downstairs.
But the fire trucks are here. They're okay for tonight, aren't they?
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.
Okay, bugs.
I'll be right back.
Does it hurt to be dead?
Animal.
What'd I do now?
- Can I tell him?
- If you wanna die.
- Well, your beer-added sperm still works. - Lisa!
- You impregnated my sister again.
- Bitch!
- I thought you wanted me to.
- Why, because I said, "Don't"?
Well, you're so afraid to say anything. The kid could've been born before he noticed.
You're not pregnant.
I feel "congratulations" is the more appropriate response.
You told her before you told me.
She's a witch! She took one look at me and guessed.
Say something.
Bummer.
Something else.
So, she's six weeks pregnant.
It means the baby's due in April, May, June...
Gemini, that's cool. Einstein was a Gemini.
So's that Scottish gal from Garbage.
Would you go upstairs and help Jake with his pajamas, please?
If she's late, you're into Cancer, which is...
Lisa, I swear to God, if you start with the Dionne Warwick stuff, I'm gonna throw you right out a fucking window, all right?
So, go upstairs please and help him with the pajamas.
Thank you. Love you, too, Tom.
Hey, this is great.
I mean it.
I think it's about time we had another kid.
You know, I was gonna bring it up myself one of these days.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
This time, you gotta take some time off, babe. - Please.
We can't afford that.
- Yes, we can, because I'm gonna hit the overtime again.
No, I do not want you to work those hours again.
You come home. You're, like, in a trance. You're completely useless to me.
I'm gonna be fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tell Teddy to get somebody else for the thing.
Tom. - What? I'm sorry, I completely forgot.
No wonder you're pissed off.
I'm not pissed off.
No, I'm not. I'm not.
I'm a grown man. I shouldn't be screwing around with some shitty band anyway.
Hey, look, I gotta go change.
You know, put on something cool.
I love you.
I'm a happy guy.
I'm not gonna be a lineman forever, I promise you that.
What do you mean?
I clip wire all day.
A monkey could do it.
Yeah, but they're gonna move you into the office soon, before the end of the year, at least.
No, I meant when we first got together I said a lot of stuff about where I was gonna go and what I was gonna be, and I just wanted you to know
that I wasn't giving you some kind of line, you know, that I meant it.
I didn't marry you because I thought you were gonna be famous.
I just liked the way your ass looked in jeans.
I never wanted be famous. I just...
- I didn't expect to be so...
- What?
I don't know. Ordinary.
You know, I hope it's a girl.
I'm kind of sick of all these balls around the house.
Except for yours, babe.
Hey, what are the odds of a reasonably educated single man being at this thing?
And I don't mean a GED.
Does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
Hey, I wouldn't look a gift boner in the mouth.
That's very nice, Lisa.
Hey, Tom-Tom-Tommy.
How you doing?
You would not believe the day I had.
You take this right here.
I'll get another one. Come on.
- Thanks. Harry. - Tom.
Taking care of the place for me?
No, actually we're drilling holes in all your floors.
Hope you don't mind.
You know my squaw, Sheila?
- Bobby, Vanessa...
Drink up. Drink up, take your medicine deep into your body. That's it.
Tom, how're you liking the neighborhood?
You know, I grew up just over in Bridgeport, back of the yard, so it's not like it's a foreign country.
Goddamn right, it's not a foreign country.
This is the best neighborhood in the city of Chicago.
That's 'cause we all look out for each other. And that is saying a lot as we approach the year of our Lord 2000.
You running for mayor?
Hey, hey, did any of you guys see them crank dealers hanging out by the park again?
What is Lenny doing at this party?
Bobby, did you tell him you had a party?
Vanessa made me, all right? We invited everybody.
I could see if he heard the noise and wandered in, but you actually invite this jack-off into your home.
Yeah, laugh it up. Laugh it up!
You know, when you wake up dead with your throat cut, don't come crying to me!
Not attracted to.
Not drunk enough for.
Frightened by!
Haven't you ever heard about people being operated on when they're under hypnosis?
Yeah, but I don't believe in any of that.
I mean, people who say that they were hypnotized weren't really. - They were just, you know, playing along. - Right.
- Really? - Yeah. Then how could they have a scalpel stuck into their throat without even bleeding or without even making a sound?
- Bullshit! - I never saw that happen.
- That is bullshit.
- Can you learn another word?
Yeah, what about "narrow-minded"?
You know, I saw a guy in my class get a 2-inch needle stuck into the thick of his arm by my instructor when he was under hypnosis.
- Horseshit. Is that better, honey?
It's disgusting.
I saw a picture of it the next day.
It left a mark. What I don't understand is how a person that spent most of her adult life in college can believe all that superstitious crap.
- It isn't superstition! - Come on. - I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
- "practically" licensed?
Isn't that like saying, "I don't have a license"?
This may come as a surprise to you, Tom, but just because you kicked around the same six blocks for your whole life doesn't mean that there isn't a whole larger world out there.
You know what I mean? Doorways you haven't even opened. Things you wouldn't have the faintest understanding of.
All right, Kreskin, prove it.
Why don't you hypnotize somebody.
- Yeah, do me.
- No.
- Why not?
- For one, you're hostile.
I'm not hostile.
Do I seem hostile to anybody?
Thanks for having us. It was a great party.
No, no. This is just getting good.
Come on, Lisa, hypnotize me.
- Come on.
- No, you're drunk.
I'm not drunk!
You're not supposed to mesmerize somebody who's been drinking.
Mesmerize. No, stop.
Please, come on, I'm begging you. Educate the savages.
Yeah, and it won't work with that kind of uncooperative attitude.
I swear to you, I'll follow every instruction to the letter. Still won't work.
What's the worst that can happen?
Somebody turn out the lights. Yeah.
All right, just relax.
Put your arm down. Just rest it comfortably. Just lean back.
Just be very comfortable and relaxed.
Trust me.
Close your eyes.
Certainly, Lisa.
Now, just listen for a moment.
Listen to the sounds of the room around you.
Now I want you to pretend you're in a theater, a movie theater.
You're the only one there.
It's one of those great old movie palaces.
And you look around.
It's a huge, empty theater.
You notice that the walls of the theater are painted in black.
The seats, covered in black.
And in the whole pitch-black theater there's only one thing you can see, and that's the white screen.
You'll notice there are letters on the screen.
Tall, thick, black letters, but they're out of focus, so you begin to drift closer to them in your chair trying to read them.
And you're very comfortable now.
It's your favorite chair.
You're drifting closer and closer staring at the letters.
Very relaxed now.
Your legs are relaxed.
Your arms are limp and heavy.
You're almost close enough to read the letters now.
They start to come into focus.
The letters spell "sleep."
Sleep.
What the hell was that?
- What? What? What?
- Are you okay?
You were faking it. You had to be.
That was the weirdly goddamn thing I've seen in my life!
He was faking it.
Congratulations, Tom, you're one of the lucky 8%.
- You still have tears on your cheeks.
- What the hell did she do to me?
Christ, I'm thirsty.
What do you mean?
What 8%?
Well, I mean, there's only 8% of the population that's, like, highly hypnotizable.
I mean, almost anybody can go under a little, but not way under. - No, slow down. - Not freaky under, like he did.
How's your hand?
- What do you mean?
- Dude, I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked you to bleed on one side but not the other.
Which I can't believe you did.
Yeah, you were very cooperative.
It was a side of you I hadn't seen before.
- That happened?
- You said it didn't hurt.
The hell with the pin. I wanna know more about.
- Joey Luca. - Yeah, right.
- Joey Luca is a kid who used to pound the shit out of you when you were 12.
You told us all about it. You were crying and moaning.
- It was hysterical. - Shut up.
It was very moving, Tom.
Joey Luca?
Jesus Christ, I haven't thought about him.
- Can we go home?
I feel kind of strange.
Close your eyes.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Don't stop.
- I don't know. I'm seeing things.
- What do you mean?
No, no, no. Wait, wait, no.
I can't right now.
Then you were faking it extremely well.
Wait, stop, stop, stop.
It's too weird.
Baby, that wasn't weird.
I could show you weird.
Like I was being attacked.
Thanks.
No, sorry, I didn't...
I'll be right back.
What the fuck?
You're awake now, Daddy.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
I just don't feel so good right now.
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.
Well, what was it, then?
An hallucination?
Yeah, yeah, a bunch of them.
It's hard to explain.
It's like all these thoughts just kept coming.
Can you believe this?
I got seven calls before lunch.
Well, if it never happened before, it had to be the hypnosis.
Your brain was agitated or something.
I had this headache like you wouldn't believe.
- I was thirsty as hell.
I know you're not watching that monster tape again.
- Who was the woman?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe somebody I met once, and I was just remembering her.
She didn't look familiar, though.
- Did you fuck her?
- You gotta be kidding.
Well, I mean, was she someone you used to go out with?
You're jealous of my hallucination?
You are pregnant.
You should call Lisa.
Lisa, please. She's the one who fucked up my brain in the first place.
Then she has to un-fuck it. - Fuck!
- Don't swear so much.
Hang on, hang on. Let me get my bearings, here.
I haven't... I have absolutely no caffeine in my system, you know.
You're asking me if I gave you a post...
Post-hypnotic suggestion. Yeah, I know what it's called.
Did you leave anything else behind when you were kicking your clumsy-ass feet around inside my brain?
Nothing.
- Tell the truth, Lisa.
- Tom, please, this is insulting.
You know, I have done this before.
Okay, good. I was just making sure.
And it was just a harmless one, anyway.
- What?
- Did it actually work?
What did you say?
I don't wanna tell you. You're grouchy.
Lisa, I swear to God!
Well, you know I've always said I think you need to be a little more open-minded, right? Yeah?
Right, so, I just said that after you wake up, your mind will be completely open, like an open door.
Open to receive everything around you, or words to that effect.
And what's that supposed to do?
Well, fuck if I know.
I never said it before. - Why, did something happen?
- Jesus Christ!
Relax, okay?
I opened a door that's all.
You know, therapists do it all the time.
It releases repressed memories and latent abilities, whatever you got back there.
In your case, it was probably old Mannix reruns.
I gotta get back to work.
No more calls for Lisa.
Hey, Lise, it's me.
Call me when you wake up. Is there any way you could babysit for us on Friday night?
I did. I told him.
What's your name? - Okay.
- ...and Tom and I wanna go to this game and I'd ask Grandma, but then I gotta hear about it for a month.
I called everyone who could possibly do it, and no one's free.
Call Vanessa.
I said call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.
Anyway, call me back. Bye.
Debbie?
- That's the girl who babysits for them?
Great idea.
Pray she's free.
- How'd you know about Debbie?
- Samantha told me.
Are you guys going out Friday night?
Hi, I'm Debbie.
Kozak?
Tom Witzky.
- Hi, Debbie, I'm Maggie.
Thanks for coming.
Jake's asleep already, and he hardly ever wakes up.
A band could play in his room and he wouldn't hear it, so you shouldn't have any trouble with him at all.
His room's upstairs at the end of the hall.
Kitchen's back there. Just help yourself if you want anything. Here, have a seat.
This is the baby monitor.
It's on B in his room, so you should hear everything.
- You wanna watch a movie?
- I got a book.
Well, it shouldn't be any later than midnight, if that's all right with you.
Perfect.
Great. I'll just grab my coat, and we're out of here.
- Ready?
- Yeah, just about. - Okay.
Where'd you find that girl Debbie?
Vanessa gave me her number.
Everybody uses her. It's cool.
Another headache?
Too much caffeine.
Okay, let's go.
Don't get me wrong,
I think that Damon kid is doing a great job and everything, and, you know, the other kid's got a decent arm, but high school football is about power. It's about running a goddamn football.
It always has been.
It was when I was in high school.
- What did you play in high school?
- Piano, mostly.
Jesus, sorry.
Here, you want some?
Anyway, Adam, and I admit that I'm biased, but my kid is having a hell of a season, and it's like nobody even notices.
If they just give him the ball, he could break 1,000 yards.
And that's in an eight-game season. Jesus Christ.
Why don't you just lick them when they walk by?
Frank says the average guy carries around a hard-on two-and-a-half hours out of every day.
Three-and-a-half for him.
I wish you hadn't told me that. See, now I gotta picture that.
One of these days, she's gonna find one of my .38s and pop a cap in my ass.
He'll stick it in a bowl of soup if it's still warm.
- You okay? - Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
If he goes over 1,000 yards, we're talking major college scholarship.
- No, thanks. The kid can write his own ticket, and that's good for everybody.
It's good for the whole goddamn neighborhood.
I mean, he's gonna go a hell of a lot further than I ever did.
Look at the quality of tail he's already getting.
I mean, he passed me in that department when he was 14.
Come on! While we're young?
You scared me.
She's downstairs, I think.
I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.
What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.
I have a secret to tell you.
Promise, promise, promise.
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.
- Who did you say?
- Samantha.
- You talk to Samantha?
- When?
- All the time.
- Where?
- Here in my house.
That's not true.
- That's cruel!
It isn't true.
- I don't tell lies.
Samantha was here?
She was here in your house?
- You're hurting my arm.
- Was she here?
Let go of me.
Come on, you're coming with me. Let's go.
She's taking him away.
Put me down!
- She took him! She took him!
What?
- The fucking babysitter, she took him. - My God!
He's not in there.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!
He's in there.
- Daddy!
- That's him!
Give me my kid. - Give me my kid.
- Tell me where she is!
You tell me where she is! You tell me where she is!
- Keep your hands off her!
Everybody shut up! - Are you okay?
- That girl kidnapped our son. - Did she hurt you?
- Is that your child?
You ask them about Samantha.
I'm asking about that boy, who sure as hell doesn't look like he belongs to you.
Wait, I can explain this, all right?
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her.
- Is that boy your child? - No.
She was babysitting for us.
We never used her before, but...
Do you know what you've done is a felony, young lady? You can go to jail for this!
- Where were you taking him?
- I wasn't taking him anywhere.
Then why the hell did you bring him to a train station?
Look, I want to press charges.
Look, she came here because of me, all right?
I work here.
I'm her mother.
Her mother? When are you gonna ask them some questions? When are you gonna ask them about Samantha?
- Who? - Samantha is my oldest daughter.
- She ran away about six months ago.
- No, she didn't run away.
She was kidnapped or something, and the little boy said he saw her!
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
We filed a police report.
There's this open investigation, but nobody wants to return any of our phone calls. He talked to her.
He said he saw her all the time in his house.
Is that her?
Stay away from him, you crazy little bitch.
- Look at the picture! - You let go of me!
Will you just look at the picture?
This is ridiculous! Do you actually think...
I have never seen her before in my life.
What about you?
No, sorry.
Never seen her.
- No, no, no, they're lying! They're lying! - Debbie.
You wanna file charges?
What?
Come on, let's just forget about it.
Let's go home.
Are you nuts?
What about the next people she babysits for?
- How could you do that? - It was her.
- Who?
- Samantha.
That girl in the picture. She's the same girl I saw on our couch.
Why did you ask that girl Debbie to babysit for us?
I couldn't find anybody else.
I was on the phone, and Jake said...
Jake? Do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen?
I was looking for a babysitter, remember?
And you said Samantha told you about Debbie.
Do you remember that?
Mommy's asking you a question, bud.
Is Samantha someone who talks to you sometimes, Jake?
Can you remember any of the things that...
Don't ask the boy any more questions.
Talk to me.
What did you say?
Jake, what did you say just now?
- Nothing. - That voice.
Let me hear that voice again.
Come on, come on, say it again.
Say it again. Do that again. - Tom.
Come on, Jake.
- Come on, come on, use the voice again. - Tom!
Come on, make the voice again, Jake.
I know you can do it, come on!
- I want to hear it again. - Tom, don't do that!
- How do you make it come back like that?
- Tom, please! Wait, it's all right.
Come on, Jake, I know you can do it. - Let's go see if Beetle Board is on now.
- Please? What are you doing?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
What do you think?
I'm just trying to have a conversation with my kid.
Yeah, a perfectly normal everyday conversation for a five-year-old.
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Why the hell shouldn't I?
I don't know. That's what he told me.
This is where it happened. This is where I saw her, you know.
- I was sitting, like, right here. - You're different. - I reached up for the remote.
- You feel different. You look different.
- Kind of 18, right? Longish kind of hair?
- I wish you could see yourself right now.
Or maybe you don't see her?
You just hear her? Is that what it is?
- You just hear her but you don't see her?
- Tom, stop it. You're freaking him out.
I've been sitting here trying to figure out a way that I could make her come back.
I'm just thinking maybe if I hang out here long enough... I'm talking to you!
...maybe she'll just come back, or maybe you could talk to her.
- It's like I'm not even sitting here!
- Help me out here, please? Hey, come on.
I don't wanna talk about this, because it scares Mommy.
- Turn it up, man. - What?
Turn it up. Louder.
Tom is looking especially together today.
Grunted a very pleasant greeting at me, actually.
Becoming sort of monosyllabic.
Nothing wrong with that guy. Nothing at all.
Nothing a little lithium couldn't cure.
I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
You live on the base. Room and board's covered. I mean, you got your service pay on top of that.
You still gotta get up real early.
By the time I retire, I got enough for a couple of down payments, some improvements.
When I take off the uniform, I'm a landlord already.
Five years later, I got three houses in this neighborhood. - Hey.
Hey, Harry.
- How you doing?
What do you know about that girl Samantha Kozak?
Samantha Kozak, that sounds familiar. Why do I know that name?
Brownish hair, 16 or 17 years old. Used to live around here.
I remember her, I think.
Hey, hey, Kurt?
Come here for a second.
Like he ever tells me anything, right?
- Say, you know that Kozak girl?
- Debbie.
No, no, no, the other one, Samantha.
You mean the retard.
Yeah, she ran away.
Yeah, that's right. I remember that.
So what about her?
I just been thinking about her a lot.
Why?
Her sister babysat for us.
This is the first time he's been out of the house in a week.
He hasn't gone to work. He sleeps, like, 12 hours a night.
He's used up all his sick days.
If he doesn't show up on Monday, they're gonna start to dock him, and I can't...
I can't get him more than six feet from the couch.
Why?
That's where she appeared to him.
I'm not shocked that there's another woman.
Of course, the fact that she's dead gives one pause.
We are talking about a ghost, here, aren't we, Maggie?
She took off last March. With a black guy, I think.
Hey, Harry, did she ever live in our house?
No, no, no, I just bought that one.
You're the first tenants.
Tom and Jake, it's like they have this private club or something.
They sit in the living room and whisper. As soon as I walk in the room, they both shut up right away.
You know what you need to do?
Find one of those young priests with smoldering good looks who can sort of guide you through this.
I'm kidding, but I'm not.
Look, I give Tom a lot of shit, but the truth is you guys are, like, the best couple on earth.
Get some help.
Find out why this is happening. There is a reason.
You won't be the first woman who's had to hold an insane family together.
Tom's not crazy.
Yes, he is.
But at least he's getting interesting.
Sports flash, sports flash. 211 yards rushing on Friday night. That's a total of 894 yards with two games to go.
The kid needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.
He could walk through the next two games and still break 1,000!
Frank, Frank, Frank, what about you?
Do you know her?
Who?
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl from over by Baldwin.
- You remember the one who ran away?
- The retard.
Shut up, Lenny.
Don't use that word.
- She was just kind of slow.
- What? Retard?
God damn it, Lenny, why don't you just shut your fucking pie hole - before I shut it for you, will you?
Somebody's always gotta ruin it. Why can't everyone just be nice?
What are you doing here?
They're gonna kill you, Tommy.
You and Maggie, both.
Why would you say something like that, Frank?
This is a decent neighborhood.
Hey, are you okay?
Where's Sheila?
She at home?
Say, I'm gonna go see if Sheila's at home.
Come in.
Is your mom at home? 'Cause your dad's acting...
Hey, you wanna see what I've got?
Sure.
That's great.
Is that one of your dad's?
Not today.
Come here.
Why don't you just put the gun away, Adam?
Come on, man. Come here.
I don't know. Those things make me kind of nervous.
Then this'll make you really nervous.
Don't do that!
Please don't be under there.
Adam, open the door!
Help!
Am I awake or asleep?
Help!
My God. My God, my baby!
- Adam!
Is he alive?
I'm gonna take him for a walk or something.
Well, hello, there.
Listen, music!
It's beautiful!
Hey, Jake, wait up!
I don't think we're supposed to be here, sweetie. Come on, let's go.
This way.
This place is cool!
Come on, honey, let's go get some lunch.
Mom, what's this thing?
I don't know.
Let me take a look.
Looks like some kind of stone.
Either that, or it's a medal. - Yeah, I think it is.
- "...served in the..."
Look, a flag.
- Everything okay?
- It's fine, just fine.
We're not supposed to be here or something?
No. It's fine. Really.
See you later.
Boy's got the eyes on him, doesn't he?
X-ray.
Not you, though.
Possibly daddy?
They're not the only ones.
Tell Daddy to come by and see me a little later tonight.
Might learn a few things.
Bye, Jake.
Bye, Neil.
His name is Neil.
Try that, Daddy.
Why do I know that song?
I'll be home right after the movie.
I know it. I know it.
I said I won't be late.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Maggie.
I don't know if I'm in the right place. I'm looking for this big guy named Neil.
I wanna see Neil.
Wait here.
I don't know her.
What are you doing? I said the boy's father.
- I said tell him to come.
- He'd never do it.
He'd kill me if he knew I was talking to you about this.
He's so paranoid.
What's the story, man?
Close the fucking door.
So are they.
- I can't let you in.
- Who are they?
Look, man, this ain't no freak show in here.
Close the damn door!
Look, you just gotta get out of here.
My husband is losing his mind.
I don't know why, but I think you do.
You can tell me what you know, but you can't tell me to go away, because I'm not moving.
- How long has he had it?
- Just a few days.
What happened? Car wreck? - No.
- Child die? No.
- Did he kill someone?
- He was hypnotized.
Is that what started it?
It comes and it goes.
Some people have it for five seconds. Some their whole lives.
He's a receiver now.
Everything's coming in. He can't stop it.
He can't even figure it out.
It's like he's in a tunnel with a flashlight, but the light only comes on every once in a while.
He gets a glimpse of something, but not enough to know what it is. Just enough to know it's there.
- Jake, too?
- Your son?
Much better flashlight.
Does he know what it wants yet?
What who wants?
He saw a ghost, didn't he?
What did it ask him to do?
She didn't ask anything.
Maybe he wasn't listening.
She's asked for something, and now she's waiting, getting more and more pissed off that he's not doing it.
If he doesn't do her thing, she'll never go away.
Absolutely not.
Please, please, please?
Five more minutes?
No, zero minutes.
This is cool.
You know The Mummy gives you nightmares if you watch it before bed.
No fair.
I know, I'm horrible.
I'm gonna take a bath.
- You okay for 10 minutes?
How do I know this song?
I know I know this song.
It's freezing.
Round up your weapons, folks!
I don't wanna talk right now.
I think the pilot blew out on the water heater again.
Can you go light it for me?
Or I could go light it.
Thanks, Colonel.
Thanks all of you.
I said no!
Bummer.
Hey, that is the most amazing...
Tom, breathe!
What happened?
- Did you see her? - What?
I want you to hypnotize me again.
All this shit, I want it out, I want it gone.
I want it all to stop right now!
Yeah, come right in, Tom I want you to meet Clarita.
Hi.
Sorry.
Look, do you think that you could...
Okay, you got to slow down. You gotta be a little patient with me here, 'cause I got a confession to make.
Just...
You see, we... I just... We just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in, so this is just blowing my mind just a little bit extra right now.
- Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me! - If you can understand.
Whatever door you opened in my brain, I want you to shut it. Now!
Okay, I'll do it.
Okay, I can do that.
Close your eyes.
Okay, just like last time, I want you to just focus and concentrate.
Listen to the sounds of the room. Listen to the sounds of your breathing.
Look at the back of your eyelids. Do you see anything there?
Could you just get to it, please?
All right, all right.
I want you to pretend you're back in the movie theater.
It's very dark, and in the whole pitch-black theater, there's only one thing you can see, and that's the white screen.
And as you focus on the screen, you begin to drift closer to it in your chair.
You'll notice that there are letters on the screen.
Tall, thick, black letters, but they're out of focus so you begin to drift closer to them.
Someone's here.
No, it's empty.
No, there's someone else in here.
No, you're alone in the theater Tom. No.
No, no, I'm not.
All right, your feet and your ankles are relaxed.
Hard to breathe.
Your hands are limp and heavy.
Your arms...
- No air no air.
- Tom, I want you to look at the screen.
- Look at the screen.
You can read the letters now.
You're right up next to them.
Tom, look at the screen!
What happened? Are you okay?
I think you need to sit down, Tom, because what was happening there was very next level.
You should have seen your face.
Do you want a beer?
Are you feeling better?
What happened?
I'm supposed to dig.
Anybody home?
Look what I'm not cleaning up.
Interesting.
Hi, honey.
What you doing?
Dad said I'm supposed to dig.
Nice.
You scared me.
I scared you?
What are you doing?
I'm supposed to dig.
What do you mean?
I'm supposed to dig.
Who says?
I see.
And what's Jake doing?
Jake is helping.
Why are you doing this?
- Water softens up the dirt.
- No, I mean...
Could you just stop for a second?
Tom, can you turn around and look at me while I'm talking to you?
What exactly don't you understand?
I'm supposed to dig.
- Why are you digging?
- I'm searching.
What are you searching for?
The question is not what.
I think we both know very well what, even if we don't want to admit it.
The question, Maggie, which you can plainly see I am very busy trying to answer, the question is "where?"
Don't worry, he's okay.
It's not over there.
We're calling the police.
And tell them what, exactly?
Practice it. Run it by me once.
I wanna see how it sounds out loud.
Anything else?
Tom, why don't you come inside with me?
I wanna talk to you.
You're not yourself right now.
This is just fucking typical!
What do you want me to do, Maggie?
You want me to go inside and just sit down on the couch in front of the TV and drink eight or nine beers until I fall asleep, then maybe just repeat the whole thing again tomorrow and the day after?
Be quiet!
- And the day after, and the day after... - Tom, just stop. ...and the day after, until I grab my chest and die?
I mean, this is the most important thing that's ever happened to me. I mean, this is the most important thing that I have ever done in my whole life, in my whole stupid life!
And you want me to just stop?
No, I won't stop.
Eight years I've known you.
Not once have you talked to me like this.
Not once.
And if you do it again, I swear to God...
And you know what else?
You're saying our stupid life, which I don't think is particularly stupid.
So, how the fuck am I supposed to feel about that?
You gonna drink that?
I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm not sorry.
- Who's that from?
- My brother, Steve.
My grandma's going back in the hospital.
No, she...
What?
Nothing.
What is it?
Steve.
I'm sorry, we've been so busy.
I was just about...
She did?
How am I doing, Dad?
You're doing great, kid. You're doing great.
I'm so sorry, baby.
You knew.
You knew, didn't you?
When is the funeral?
Sunday.
We should leave as soon as we can.
You want me to go with you?
I meant, I just thought with your family and everything...
Do I want you to go with me?
To my grandmother's funeral? She practically raised me.
Of course I want you to come.
It's just I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
$800 a month. Can't get any fucking water! Fuck it!
Tools.
This is a rented house.
- It's me. Hey.
Hey, baby, how you doing?
- I'm okay.
- How's your family?
You know, drunk.
Fighting with each other.
Listen, Maggie, I'm so sorry.
I mean, I should be there with you.
- I'm an asshole.
- Yeah, well, you have your good points.
- How do you feel? - Fine.
Fine, you know.
Much, much, much better.
Everything's fine here, really good.
No more digging?
It's back to normal.
I'm sorry, too.
I wish I hadn't just stormed out of there like that. I shouldn't have left you alone.
I deserved it.
Why don't you come up here with us?
This time of night, you could make it in an hour.
- No, no. I can't really do that.
- Why not?
Well, you know, I'm not supposed to use the truck for personal trips.
All right, then, I'll pick you up. I'll leave right away.
No, no, baby, don't do that.
No, no. That's crazy.
Look, I gotta go.
I'll just pull up front and honk.
Okay, bub, you ready to go?
I'm scared to go home.
I wanna stay at Uncle Steve's house.
Why are you scared?
Because of the feathers.
What feathers?
I don't know, just the feathers.
It's okay, I'll watch him.
Okay. You be good.
Mom, wait!
You forgot this.
Come here a sec.
What?
Come closer, I can't hear you.
Are you talking to me?
I wanna show you something.
You wanna show me something?
Yeah. I don't see anybody else around.
What is it?
It's a surprise.
It's really great.
Come on, you won't believe it.
Come on, it's freezing.
Hey, happy Saint Patrick's Day.
What's the surprise?
- Don't you have it?
Take it. You need another drink.
No, man, I got the spins already.
Drink, motherfucker, drink. Drink.
- I don't think there is a surprise.
- Yeah, there is.
The surprise is we decided we wanna be your friends.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Why do you wanna be my friends now?
Are you kidding?
Look at yourself.
You can take your coat off, you know.
- Want a drink?
- I'm not supposed to.
Don't you do anything you're not supposed to?
I do.
Mama, you are hot.
Come on, let's be friends?
You can kiss me, if you want to.
- Not like that, okay? - Okay, okay.
I wanna go home.
Come on, sweetie, I'll be your friend.
- I swear I will. Just be nice to me.
- I want to, but...
Be a good girl.
You are a good girl, aren't you?
I have to go home.
Come on, baby, how about a little helmet wash?
I have to go home!
Shut up!
Stop, man!
Make her stop screaming!
Shut her up, man!
Use your jacket or something. Put it over her face.
Shut up!
What the fuck did you do that for?
- Is she dead?
- No shit she's dead.
Look at her tongue, man.
I'm not here.
I've never seen nobody dead before.
- I can't be here.
- It's fucking gross.
This isn't happening.
Fucking plastic over her face!
Good thinking, Adam.
Well, what do we do now?
How's he doing?
He might make it.
He might not.
Sheila's over at the hospital.
I'm gonna head over.
Frank, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, because, I think I know why Adam shot himself.
I gotta call the police about it.
And I don't want you to hear it from them, and I don't want Sheila to read about it in the paper.
I think you have a right to know before anybody else.
What are you talking about, Tom?
Come with me.
Wait here for a second.
Better be important.
How the hell did you find this?
Does it matter?
You don't know if it was Kurt and Adam.
Yeah, I do.
But you don't have anything to...
Come on, Tom.
You're talking like a goddamn lunatic. That's what people are gonna say.
It's just a body.
It doesn't prove anything.
She's got somebody's hair in her hand.
They're gonna be able to tell whose it is.
we gotta call the cops.
What were we supposed to do?
It was an accident.
The kids come to us.
She's already dead.
The damage is done.
There's nothing anybody can do to bring her back.
But these kids got everything ahead of them.
So what were we supposed to do, Tom?
Send our sons to jail for the rest of their lives because of her?
Who you planning to shoot with that?
- Get the hell out of here, Tom.
- Hey, Frank, come on upstairs.
We can talk about this.
I been living with this for six months.
Six fucking months!
Do you think anything you have to say is gonna make one bit of difference to me?
- Get the hell out of here!
- I'm not leaving until...
Boy, it's really pouring?
Yeah, looks like it.
Hey, you got a minute?
No, I'm kind of busy right now.
It's important.
I don't really have time to talk right now, Harry.
Jesus!
Harry, like I said, you know, I'm really kind of busy right now.
Kurt, I know you weren't raised in a barn. Close that door.
Maybe I could call you later or something?
Tom, we got ourselves a serious problem here.
What do you mean?
What the hell you think you're doing to my house?
I heard all this pounding going on up here. I thought I'd better come up, check it out.
I didn't think in a million years you'd be wrecking the place.
What's the matter with you?
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of that.
I was trying to fix your water main, you know.
It was leaking like a son of a bitch, and I couldn't get to it from underneath the house.
I couldn't get under the house to get to it.
Is that right?
Damn.
A lot of water damage?
Some.
Can I look around?
Yeah, sure. Sure. Help yourself.
Maybe you better show me where it's at.
You guys'll be able to see it.
I gotta take off right now.
I'm almost afraid to look.
Drink it.
Hurry up.
The water main doesn't run under the house.
Well, I know that now.
Shit, Tom.
Get him on the rug.
Don't look at him. Roll him over. - Yeah.
- Let's go!
All right, get out of the way.
Are you here?
Shit.
Out of the way, Kurt!
They were gonna kill you, Tommy.
You and Maggie, both.
- Are you okay?
Cold-blooded murder.
Can't let something like that happen.
Not here.
This is a decent neighborhood.
MIFUNE'S LAST SONG
Thank you ... thank you.
... Did we really do it?
Always check out your future mum-in-law.
Mine is so beautiful!
It'll last, Marianne.
Congratulations ... !
Dear Kresten ... a couple of years ago you stormed into the firm and into our hearts. Alone in the world, with no family and no past, but with enormous drive.
I am relying on you, Kresten, and I expect a lot of you. So I am happy to give Claire into your arms.
Will you get my veil?
No, kiss me first.
Come on ...
Yes?
Mikkelsen?
Gerner Mikkelsen?
What the fuck do you want?
It's a really bad moment.
Is he there?
Of course I'm coming.
What's going on?
- I've got to go.
To Lolland.
Lolland?
My dad's died.
Your dad?
You haven't got a dad.
No ... but I had one after all.
Why lie?
You could just have said so.
Said what?
We fell out.
I hadn't seen them for 10 years. Them?
Are there others?
- Yes, I've got a brother.
This is too much.
Oh, stop it.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because he is an idiot.
What does he do?
- He has a big accountancy practice. In Nakskov or Saxkøbing.
Is it happy?
Mellow out, it'll only be a day or two.
It's not my fault he's just died.
- What's his place like?
A big farm.
- A farm?
You red neck!
Shall I come?
- No, I'd have to explain things.
I'll make it as quick as I can.
It is happy.
Two days, all right?
... Kresten here.
Hi, Baby.
You did drive fast!
Liar! ...
No, I've been reading telegrams.
By the way, I think you should phone daddy.
He thinks it's a bit ... odd ...
Kresten?
Is something the matter?
No, everything's fine.
It's just a bit weird being back.
No, it's just the cows.
Honey, I'll have to go.
Kisses, baby, too.
'Bye.
What about your brother?
I have to be back in Copenhagen the day after tomorrow.
You'll have to take him along.
- What do you normally do?
There must be a home or something.
If there are relatives we don't normally do very much.
It could take months.
This is the country, Kresten.
... Thanks for phoning.
Some families make private arrangements.
Get a domestic.
You can afford it.
I'll phone you if I need you.
- I'm sure you will.
Are you still sulking because I stole your bird?
Vivi ...
She sang like a nightingale when she had it up her.
You never heard her sing, did you?
Bugger off, Gerner.
Rud ...
Rud ...
Hi.
Come along, Rud.
Come along.
Do you hear that?
See, I haven't forgotten your favourite.
I haven't forgotten that, either.
Ouch ... you've got hard fingers.
Your fingers are hard now.
We must give dad a fine funeral.
Has your car got a sun roof?
- Yes.
Automatic.
Dad's car.
It can play ...
Is it your car? - Yes.
Shall we go for a ride?
Have a shave and get changed, all right?
Hi, Jørgen, it's Kresten.
Yes, it's a mess.
I'll explain when I get home.
No, we haven't had much to do with each other.
There is also some money in it.
... Yes?
Why the hell didn't he?
Put me through to him, then.
Yes, see you later, Jørgen.
- Kresten?
Kresten! Kresten!
Hi, Lasse ... Kresten speaking.
What the hell's going on?
I'm away a day and everything goes to pot.
See to it! It's 400 shipments!
Take him out to dinner or buy him a hooker, I don't care.
Find those figures for me.
That's where you kissed Ingrid.
Did you see that?
- You kissed Ingrid with your tongue.
Yes?
No signal? ...
What are we going to do, Rud?
We must remember to feed the hens.
First we'll make sure dad gets a decent funeral, right?
That's where we sailed on the tractor inner tube.
And afterwards we'll find a really good home for you.
I have a home. I have a home.
I have a home.
You can come and see me.
I have a home.
- Rud, listen ...
I have a home.
- We'll go to the fair.
Relax, Rud.
- I have a home.
I have a home ...
There are loads of effects to be sold.
Antiques and stuff.
Yes. Very lovely.
... Listen to the birds.
Could you hear?
Rud is handling it.
Yes, my brother.
Rud ... yes, that's his name.
R - u - d.
No, he's not as much of an idiot as I'd thought.
Rud, come on in.
Get up.
OK, stay here. But you'll get no cake afterwards.
We 're starting.
To the very end he cared lovingly for the son still living at home.
Life was never easy for Karlo Jensen.
He had many difficult times.
The loss of his beloved wife was a severe blow.
But the Lord lets His light shine upon those who have looked the devil in the face.
Thank you, a fine sermon.
- Fly up into the light!
Has your brother ever heard the scriptures?
People can be cretinous, yet still be religious.
Can Rud Jensen read?
Two girls do it with you on the phone.
"Do it hard, and do it quickly!"
"Listen to me fingering my cunt" .
- Thank you.
He never paid dad when he bought pork.
Is it time for the cake now?
I hadn't seen your dad for ten years.
He went a bit funny.
Burned all your mum's furniture.
Have you nowt to sit in, then?
Then the livestock died.
You know they took him to court? No ...
- Well, they did.
You were wise to escape from that dung hole.
I married Lennart.
- Lennart?
A nutter, but a lovely fellow.
We bought a house in Løgtofte.
I expect we'll bump into each other.
- Yes. Take care, now, Britta.
He'll be in a wheat field chasing space ships ...
We must sing, Kresten.
The way we usually do.
Don't you like it?
- Where is my money, Rud?
Rud ...
- I haven't got any money.
The paper shop was closed.
What have you bought?
- I haven't any money.
The scratch cards are in your pants? - No.
That's enough, Rud.
Fuck off into your room.
Go on!
- Housekeeper wanted - For family in beautiful country property, to start immediately
Bruce Springsteen.
- He's not an actor.
He's a great singer and I love that lower jaw.
Next ...
Big house with sea view.
No kids, just Søren Pilmark.
He's a real looker, has a sly smile, he is witty, intelligent ...
Bali ... Candidasi.
I'm taking Richard Gere. His guru is Swamina Arnanda.
OK. 6 to 8 children by Jean-Claude Van Damme.
A gorgeous arse and dreamy brown eyes.
And a good actor.
- Next!
Bruce Willis, 'cause my tits are bigger than his wife's .
Liva ...
- No, I don't want to.
Go on ...
All right, I'll take Boris Yeltsin.
Let's queue for the balloons.
Is it that psychopath again?
Fuck him.
Come on.
Liva ...
I'm watching you, Liva.
All the time.
Always.
I am right nearby.
My beloved little pink whore ...
I'm looking at you right now.
At last, Liva ...
I am Liva Psilander. Bjarke's elder sister.
Can I talk to Bjarke?
Thanks.
Bjarke, what the fuck is going on?
What are you doing in the headmaster's study?
Listen, I've told you you can't stay with me.
In deep shit?
I'll tell you about deep shit.
Bjarke ...?
Yes, OK.
No spilling on the Persian carpet.
My grandfather brought it home.
You are so strong ...
I'd hate to be punished by you.
Though corporal punishment is a vital part of life even in childhood.
Isn't it rather old-fashioned?
I'm still on the disciplinary committee at my old school.
We maintain the tradition of a firm hand.
What do you mean?
- I've just caned one young lout.
A pupil there?
Psilander.
Bjarke Psilander.
Damn it!
Yes?
Just a moment, please.
Yes, hello?
Horsted-Petersen speaking.
No, not at all.
... We've got a lien on the property.
We 're over-insured.
It is a perfectly ordinary case of water damage.
May I call you back?
No, keep the planning officer out of it!
I'm keeping an eye on you, you pink little whore.
Next time I'll fuck your pink little quim.
It's how he gets his kicks, that's all.
Nothing'll happen to you.
- He's just a chance psychopath ...
I don't give a toss. I just want to get away.
Get a job as a tour guide.
Lanzarote and lovely little Italians.
There are no Italians in Lanzarote.
- But what about Bjarke?
Any of your tricks been pervs?
All my tricks are pervs.
We should catch him and poke his eyes out.
Or get an unlisted number.
- I've had three. He must know somebody.
Two days, and he's found me again.
I told the police. They couldn't give a damn.
The police are bastards.
Right.
It's a pharmaceuticals company.
The boss is an old alcoholic or he takes too many of his pills.
But he digs big tits, so Pernille, that's you.
Right ... for the rest of you there's a slimy grey suit who'll show you whose spectacles to take off, OK?
A word ...
Don't touch me.
He's great customer, right?
With an arse full of money.
So it wasn't too bright, pissing all over his Persian carpet.
Are you crazy?
You're getting way out of line.
I know you are listening.
Oh, Liva, take it now ...
My little pink whore ...
Who is that?
What are you at, you pervert?
You psychopath!
What do you want?
Come along, we've got work to do.
We can sing it another day, right?
Don't !
- You can't stink of shit. Not in company.
- I don't want company.
You just behave, right?
She's going to work for us.
And remember what we said?
Telling lies is wrong.
Dad said so.
We've always lived here, right?
Why do I have to be washed?
Because you do.
Stop it, Rud ...
- The lights are landing.
The rings will take Rud. The rings will take Rud ...
Mifune ... do you remember Mifune?
Do you remember Mifune?
Shall we go and find Mifune?
Shall we see if Mifune's in?
Remember ...
maybe we'll see Mifune.
Remember he's down there?
Mifune!
Toshiro Mifune!
I think he's there.
Mifune ...
Rud, he is there!
Mifune ...
Mifune, you cross old seventh Samurai!
Where are you?
Mifune, come on out!
Rud, he is here.
Stay there.
Mifune, come here.
Run, Rud!
Run!
Hi.
Liva Psilander.
Hi.
I brought my references.
Kresten Jensen.
It's a game I play with my brother, where I ...
He was here a moment ago.
But you don't look like a housekeeper.
What do you mean?
- I just ... I was just expecting a 15 stone 60-year-old.
Well, you don't look like a ...
maybe I'd expected ...
No.
Linda!
Why the Sunday best?
She's just a lady who's going to work for us.
Rud, just say hello nicely.
And remember what we said. - Yes.
Linda.
Hello.
They'll land out there in the marsh ... The lights.
The lights?
- Yes.
Valentin ...
The lights may land in the marsh.
Yes.
I'll pass it on.
Oh, shit!
It's got no suck at all, has it?
Our dad just died, and we 're trying to figure things out.
You can empty it round the back.
We've got work to do.
Let her settle down and find her rhythm.
I have to go to Copenhagen, and you must help her.
Cut the alien crap, you'll scare her away.
Get a grip.
Herning's hens don't taste good.
Why not?
- They're White Leghorns.
Who is Henning?
- I don't know.
But Herning is one of my friends.
Can you cook anything else?
What do you like?
Meatballs and sausage and spaghetti, fried fish, pork ... Yes, OK.
That's what you'll get.
We'll sort everything out tomorrow, OK?
Kresten has never been fond of chicken.
... two nutty brothers.
One of them calls me Linda.
... Crazy.
- Any neighbours?
It's 20 minutes by taxi to the mail box.
You'd better keep a cosh under your bed ... those red necks ...
Kick them in the balls.
Not till they do anything to me.
- They will.
Those rubes have been living with the chickens for 30 years!
Thanks a bunch ...
one of them is coming.
Thanks.
Did you hear that?
It was Rud the Nut. He brought me ... a UFO.
Goodnight, Kresten.
- Hey, are you ill?
Are you going to bed so early?
- Linda has gone to bed, too.
Liva.
Her name is Liva.
Stop that Linda stuff, right?
You wouldn't like it if people called you Ruddi.
They can if they want.
- But her name is Liva.
Goodnight.
Ruddi.
No, Darling, that's a lousy idea.
The house has been stripped of furniture.
Can't we just meet halfway?
The Mogenstrup Inn at 8 o'clock?
Come off it, why should we meet at an inn?
I want to see the home where you grew up.
I can come at once. I need to get back tonight, though, to see Torben.
Oh? You've got a date? I see.
Yeah, and I've got a couple of ex-girlfriends, too.
Stop it, Darling.
I was only joking.
Of course I haven't .
OK?
Kisses, baby, too.
'Bye.
Good morning.
It's breakfast.
Have you no animals at all?
Yes, we've got hens.
And we have a cat.
But it isn't called anything.
It must be called something.
You could think of a name for it.
- It used to be called something.
It used to be called Freja.
But it doesn't come when called.
And so my dad said it shouldn't be called anything.
So now it isn't called anything.
And we had pigs in the old cow shed.
But that didn't work out, either.
Because they didn't need milking.
- No. They disappeared.
And we've got corn and sugar beet.
But they're not animals.
We've leased the land to another farmer.
Good morning.
We'll go now.
'Bye, Rud.
I've got to go to Copenhagen for a day or two.
When?
In the morning.
You deserve a treat.
Do you like wine?
Yes.
Rud doesn't drink.
- I think this'll do.
You're the flower type.
The freezer's in the utility room.
Well, then, Gerner!
Any news?
Who's she?
- Just a lady who works for us.
I see!
Where did you hire her?
None of your business.
- Is she staying long?
Until you find somewhere for Rud.
- There'll be a place at Otterup.
That's a lunatic asylum.
Rud's not going there.
I don't know who you think you are.
Round here that's where we put weirdoes.
We burn down farms like this.
Have you heard her sing?
Goodbye, Gerner.
- You couldn't manage her, eh?
'Bye.
How come it doesn't make a noise?
- So you won't hear it land. Oh ...
Does your brother believe in this UFO stuff, too?
No, no, he isn't like us.
He doesn't believe in rings in the corn.
We've an early start, so goodnight.
Goodnight, Rud.
He's really cute ... has he always been like that?
Yes.
Is your room OK?
- Yes, it's fine.
How do you make a living here?
- I've business in the city.
Are you a businessman or a farmer?
- What do I get for the right answer?
Whoops, we nearly talked the nice atmosphere to death.
Have you got a spare bulb?
- Er ... yes.
Is there a rag somewhere?
- The one you're wearing.
Don't mock a farmer's wardrobe.
Here, let me.
Aren't you tall!
And clever with it.
Thanks.
Would you like a whisky while it cools down?
Excuse me ...
I am looking for Kresten Hostrup-Jensen.
This is the place.
Hi.
Well ... goodnight.
What kind of place is this?
What's going on, Kresten?
Who is she?
Claire, listen ...
- No ...
Don't touch me.
What is this?
Claire, for fuck's sake!
Give me the keys to my car.
Bastard! Give them to me!
They're in the ignition.
- Thank you. Listen!
Claire!
Claire, let me explain ...
Why does it have to be like this?
Let me explain.
There is nothing to explain.
That won't work.
Stop it.
- Not any more.
You've got a screw loose.
- Listen, Darling ...
Claire, listen!
Listen to me!
Chill out ...
Come here, Baby.
- Leave me alone!
I hate you.
I hate you.
You're horrid.
You're a liar and you stink of cow shit.
Chill out, for fuck's sake.
Hell, you're my wife!
Claire, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Claire.
I want a divorce.
I want a divorce.
You psychopath!
Psychopath!
Did she hit you, too, Kresten?
Did she hit you, too?
She hit Kresten, too!
Did she hit you hard?
What the hell is going on?
Was that your wife?
No, an ex-girlfriend who keeps stalking me.
A funny way of stalking people.
Wouldn't it be better if I left?
I mean, you're going back to Copenhagen.
And I'm not going to babysit for Rud on my own.
Specially not if crazy women come here and beat him up.
Look around you ...
this isn't what your ad said.
I don't want to get mixed up in anything.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Two seconds ...
Here ... a pay rise.
Will you stay now?
Are you sure I'm what you need?
- Of course. Hence the pay rise.
We can't manage anything.
We can't wash up. We can't clean up.
We can't even make a cup of fucking coffee, man.
We can't do a fucking thing.
We can't manage without you.
Has she come back?
No.
She took the car, Kresten.
Yes, hi.
Where are you?
How's his carpet?
It still smells of pee.
Your pee.
He's sleeping like a log;
I beat him with the vacuum hose for 2 hours.
So I reckon Bjarke owes me an outing to the fair.
That's why I'm phoning.
Bjarke has been expelled from school.
It's a real bummer.
Can't we talk to them?
No; he has to be picked up on Friday.
You don't want to know.
A fire extinguisher in the headmaster's study.
Rud!
Where is Liva?
- With the bees.
He won't talk to me?
Give over, he's my father-in-law!
Rud says your brother's in trouble.
He's welcome to stay here a week or two.
I have to go to Copenhagen and Rud's a problem.
Why do you live here all alone?
Dad used to look after him.
- What about your mum?
What about her?
She hanged herself from one of the oldest oaks in Denmark.
She was interested in history.
In the woods.
I cut her down.
Why did she do it?
- Oh, I don't know.
My father refused to talk about it.
She didn't even write a suicide note.
Rud still potters about out there now and then.
Please say you'll stay.
We'll have to pick up Bjarke.
Sure ... after all, we've just got a new car.
Rud, take that thing off.
... You'll scare the lad.
Go on!
Fucking hell, what a place, man!
I'm not sodding well staying here.
Your room's next to mine.
Try and talk to him.
He's called Bjarke ...
Talk about a shit hole!
It'll give you salmonella.
And you ... you're a fucking pansy.
Faggot ... moron ...
Wanker ... arsehole.
Stop that.
Be nice to Rud.
He reminds me of my form master.
- Cut it out.
Chill out, man, and tell him what you really do.
She flies with Valentin.
- Yeah, come fly with Valentin! Cut it out.
No, Bjarke, damn it!
Rud, stop it!
Get a grip ...
Fucking peasants.
Why did you drag me here?
- You should've behaved at school.
What do you think will happen when they discover you're shafting them?
I won't be here that long.
Be nice to Rud. We'll be away for an hour.
Get me two packets of fags, OK? "Linda!"
What brand?
- Minigolf ...
What the fuck are you at, man?
Give it back!
Where's my book?
Jeeze ...
I'll smash you, you fucking spastic ...
The prettiest arse in Lolland.
Kresten and I have always had the same taste.
You think so?
The difference is that I have a sense for the details.
Very neat ...
Was he bothering you?
- No, not at all.
Ever been to Africa?
Come with me.
Wait there.
It's a he.
We like drawing attention to ourselves.
What about the hens?
The hens are honest, diligent and abstemious.
What is it?
Haven't you got a man?
A man!
... None of your business.
Out here in the country we have no secrets.
Out here in the country you have no inhibitions.
Inhibitions?
Actually there's a town down here called Inhibition ... it's true!
It is!
It's famous for its pizzles.
- Its what?
Pizzles.
Its what?
- Pizzles.
You are such nutters.
No ...
It's the sugar beet.
Hi, Darling.
Of course I would.
The harbour?
Farther out?
... The end of the mole?
They're in the farmyard.
Bjarke looks like a Japanese tourist.
Kresten is a Samurai.
Are you there?
Do you fancy the Samurai or am I just stupid?
I don't know.
You'll find it hard to convince anyone that you're a red neck.
Take care, now.
Come straight home, right?
Who are you trying to impress?
What the hell are you at?
Oh, Rud, now I'll have to splash you, too.
You could lend a hand.
Rud, you've fallen into bad company.
Haven't you any other friends?
It says Herning.
The chicken guy?
Right then.
Rud ... where are the rest?
In the water?
There are no stone axe heads out there.
Like hell there are.
OK. Find another one.
Go on, tough guy.
I knew it. You're a wimp.
And I bet you've never had any pussy.
Wimp!
Jerk ...
Fucking spastic ...
Rud, take it easy ...
Shit! This is wild!
- Listen!
Hi, Kresten, lovely of you to come.
With all your lies and surprises, I thought it was my turn.
I'm afraid I've only got two.
This is one of them.
The other is that you're not to show up at dad's firm again.
So fill in the divorce papers and have a good life.
By the way, Torben has helped me. You bet he makes it happy.
Kisses, baby.
Why not give the loonies some booze?
They'd be a real laugh if they were pissed.
Well now ... a cigar?
Linda must smoke, too.
- Too true.
Yuck!
Yes, happiness is a good cigar.
Happiness is when Mifune ... comes out of the cellar.
Who the heck is Mifune?
He is strong.
He never gives up.
The seventh Samovar ...
It ... is Kresten. Samurai.
- Is Kresten a Samovar?
Stop mussing my hair.
- I'll give you a kiss.
Stop it, it's revolting.
Stop it ... now give Rud one.
Well then, Herning ... are you going to play to us?
What about "Incy wincy spider?" Stop it, Bjarke.
Goodnight.
Mifune, my arse.
Piss. Shit.
Good morning.
Ouch, bloody hell, man!
Got our period, have we?
Do you mind?
Don't your tricks all smoke afterwards?
The trick you had last night did.
- Run along and have a shower.
You stink to high heaven.
- I couldn't care.
I could.
Run along.
Being told off leaves me cold.
Specially by a whore like you.
Don't you call me that.
I do it for your sake.
" All the time, Liva.
Always."
"I will always be near my beloved pink whore."
What did you say?
Say it again.
Say it again.
" All the time, Liva."
" Always."
"I will always be near my beloved pink little cunt."
Was it you?
Kresten?
What are you doing?
Have you gone crazy?
- It's none of your business.
You work here, so answer nicely.
- Piss off.
Or we'll go by your contract and you can whitewash the place.
Right Rud, let's sing.
Isn't this what you dream of?
Sing, Rud, damn it! Come on!
It's what you dreamed of.
A little family ...
He misses his mummy. Is that it?
Now we are proper little family that can sing and rot away down here.
Come on, Rud.
Sing!
It's cold and I'm far from home ... Sing, damn you.
Call your fucking space ship, man.
They can help you sing.
Linda, Linda, Linda ...
- Rud, calm down.
Rud, she'll come back.
- The rings'll take Rud ...
Rud, calm down, she'll be back.
What is going on?
Please go and find her, Kresten.
We three are a right bunch of loonies.
Not Rud.
Hello?
I'm just phoning to say I'm OK.
They're bastards. How dare they treat me like that?
Like what?
Bjarke, the little turd, ruined everything.
They're jerks, all of them.
Was it that Kresten bloke?
... What did he do? Did he hit you?
He's a prick, a filthy prick.
A bastard.
Crazy.
- Calm down.
We'll help you.
It's too late.
- Calm down, Liva, you're drunk.
I sure bloody am.
Sure you are.
We'll come and get you.
Stay the fuck away.
I'll say if I want to leave.
See you.
Slumming?
Where is she?
- Who?
Kresten, for fuck's sake ...
My housekeeper.
Can't keep your staff, eh?
You are a peasant.
A peasant.
And you always have been.
How about you, Gerner?
Things going well for you?
Having fun?
The King of Nakskov, are you?
Having fun out here amidst the sugar beet?
Kresten ...
Kresten, I've got my eye on you.
I'll get you, wise guy.
Beat it.
- Sure.
Beat it, I said.
- I'm on my way.
Piss off.
My turn. Come on ...
Come on! Open the door!
Did you have fun?
- Shut up, Kresten.
What the hell was the idea?
I hate it.
Only psychopaths do stuff like that.
I must be a psychopath.
- Of course you're not.
You don't .
Bjarke, I'm not buying that.
The neglected little boy who needs attention ... Know what?
Everyone does.
But they have to behave themselves all the same.
Life is one long turd that you have to take a huge bite of every day; get used to it.
But never feel so sorry for yourself that you piss on other people.
At any rate, not the ones who love you.
Don't you see?
You're all I've got, I'm all you've got.
We have to take care of each other.
It's over.
We'll say goodbye politely and go back to Copenhagen.
Why?
- You'll tell them about me.
No.
- You will.
No ... they're nice.
Rud and Kresten.
And we'd be together.
- We leave tomorrow.
You brat ...
Need any help?
You're the man in charge.
Just go by our contract.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Just paint.
Can't we just ...
- Paint!
You know what you are?
White.
That, too.
I'd like to book a taxi for 1 a.m.
From Katrinebæk on Kastbæk Road.
Two people, to Copenhagen.
Is it there?
- Brilliant.
Steady as a rock.
Well done!
- What's happening?
Bjarke Psilander passes to Rud Jensen.
Rud Jensen passes to Donald Duck.
Rud Jensen heads the ball.
But the hung-over woman goalie parries it; how incredible!
Goal!
2-2 to Lolland!
2-2 to Lolland ... 2-2 to Lolland!
Ebbe Sand, Ebbe Sand, Ebbe Sand ...
Ebbe Sand from Lolland!
Where have you hidden the cook?
- Go and get Rud and Bjarke.
Oh, how sweet!
Thanks for the invitation.
We picked them where we go out to piss.
Are you sure we have to go?
Yes.
I'll wake you at the den at 12.45.
Come on.
The time has come for me to say a word or two.
But ...
Well, I don't know what to say.
Cheers, then.
Bottoms up.
What a pig!
I'll clear up in the morning.
Come on.
Goodnight, Mifune.
Let go of me!
If you can fuck Fat Flemming and his mates We want some too.
- Get off me, you bastard.
Don't worry, we'll pay for it.
Come on, you little whore ...
Let go of her.
That'll do.
I'm sorry, Kresten, I'm sorry.
It wasn't your fault.
The woman who came here was my wife.
Claire.
Why didn't I just tell them that my brother was a cretin and my dad was rotting away in a dump in Lolland?
And then I go and fall in love with my housekeeper.
That's what people are like here; totally trite and total liars.
I know.
- You do?
I can't , I can't ...
Well?
- I knocked, but there's no answer.
I think we should go in.
Shit, he's raped her.
He's fucking well raped her.
Shit, man, he's got a knife.
- Call the police.
He's killed her.
- Let's get him ...
- Move those bloody flowers.
Stay still.
Stay still.
Have some whisky.
Hold him steady.
Hold him tight.
You ought to have your balls cut off, you bastard.
No!
Rud ...
Rud!
I believe I'm standing right here, Kresten.
What happened?
You were asleep, and then bump ...
- What are you on about?
She ... they ... they ... They found me in Nakskov.
- Nakskov?
Come here.
Have you told him, Rud?
He's a real Scrooge McDuck.
He found all this cash in a green plastic bag.
Scrooge McChicken ...
It's just like with Ingrid.
How fucking naff, man.
We 're out of here. Before it gets pornographic.
Some people say what they're doing beats anything else.
But it's no fucking fun to watch, is it?
No, but we'll be staying here now, right?
Are you crazy?
We 're all staying. For 5000 years.
The orchestra too?
Nobody else'll listen to that crap.
It's today!
It's today! It's today!
It's today! It's always today, Geofge.
-I mean, this is the day.
-That's fight.
-Can't I come?
-You have to go to school, Geofge.
-Will he be hefe when I get home?
-I think so.
I'll play ball with him. I'll wfestle with him.

Actually, we wefe leaning towafds a boy.
Well, in that case Benny can do handstands.
Andy can fun 1 00 yafds fastef than you can say, " Ready, set, go."
You ceftainly know a lot about evefyone.
That's what happens when you've been hefe as long as I have.
Let's face it. Not evefyone wants to adopt someone like me.
You shouldn't woffy about choosing. It happens the same way evefy time.
Fifst, you won't know what to do. You'll be a bit scafed.
Then you'll meet one of them.
You'll talk to him.
Somehow you just know.
Afe you quite ceftain you'fe pfepafed to handle his uniqueness?
Oh, my, yes.
His uniqueness is a peffect fit fof the Little family.

Well, it will in this case.

A brother!

They say every Little can find this house.
Even if they've never been here.
It's just something inside them.
Something inside.

Don't you have anything you wanna ask Stuaft?
Sufe, Geofge.

I'm an open book.

This is my family.
Can't we shafe them?

So?
Don't you want to face youf boat?
-I'm not so good at the facing paft.
-So what?
It doesn't mattef about winning. You tfy like heck, and you have fun.
It's fun to finish last?
Something fofmal, I should think.
I'm not sufe of the fabfic, but it should bfeathe.
He has a tendency to buffow and climb and genefally scuffy about.
Well, I'm sufe we can find something to suit youf pafticulaf need.
Hefe we have Bafbados Ben.
Chef Ben.
Lumbefjack Ben.

This is a feal Schmelling.
-Those afe the best kind.
-You know what they say:
-" lf it ain't Schmelling...." -" It ain't bowling."
Look hefe, Stuaft.
Climb on up hefe, son.
Plant youf caboose fight up hefe.
He may have to gfow into it.
I think he's gfown a little since we've been hefe.
That's what happened to me.
One summef, I just shot fight up.
May I say something?
In the ofphanage, we used to tell faify tales of finding ouf families and having a pafty like this.
A pafty with cakes and pfesents and all vafieties of meat loaf.
A pafty with a big family who came ffom faf away just to wish us well.
I don't know much about families but this must be the nicest family in the wofld.
So I just wanted to thank each of you.
Because now I know faify tales afe feal.
Faify tales afe feal?
I think I'm gonna cough up a fufball.
Now it's time fof the best pfesent.
It's something fof you and Geofge.
Stand next to Stuaft.
This is something that gave youf fathef and me houfs of enjoyment when we wefe young bfothefs just like you and Stuaft.
This ball belonged to youf gfeat-gfeat-gfandfathef Jedediah Little.
Remembef, Ffedefick, those long summef days playing catch?
Take youf bfothef outside and toss afound the old hofsehide.
What do you say?
You feady?
Afe you all nuts?
Bicycles and bowling balls?
How will he toss a baseball?
How will he do any of those things?
He's not my bfothef. He's a mouse.
-Time to go.
-Excellent idea.
What, what?
Whefe?
Did I huft you?
What's the mattef?
I just wanted to ask you something, but you wefe alfeady asleep.
-What did you want to ask?
-About my feal family.
You know, the ones I look like.
He hates us.
We've nevef been hated befofe.
No, it's not that. It's not that at all.
It's just that something's missing.
I feel an empty space inside me and I want to know what was thefe befofe.
You have an empty space.
That's so sad.
I hope I haven't left you dismayed and disappointed.
We don't feel dismayed and disappointed.
Not at all.
Afe you sufe?
We'fe ceftain, Stuaft.
And if you want us to, we'll find out about youf feal pafents.
Well, good night then.
Out of the question.
It's against the fules.
Besides, it's vefy hafd to tfack mouse families.
They'fe not vefy good with papefwofk.
But he has an empty space.
Afe thefe pfoblems with Stuaft?
Pfoblem--?
No, not at all.
-Well, thefe's been a few....
-Difficulties.
Difficulties?
Well, like the cat tfying to eat him when we fifst bfought him home.
He spat the boy out, of coufse, in one heck of a jiffy.
Mfs. Keepef....
He wants to know about his family.
Any child would have questions about that.
Yes.
I know that you and I got off on the wfong paw.
I just wanted to see if we could staft out ffesh.
You know? Clean slate.
What do you say?
Wanna be ffiends?
Okay then.
He's playing with my head.
He's tfying to psych me out.
Sick little fodent!
Snow, let me in!
I'm stafving!
What's in the dish today?
Oh, no.
Monty the Mouth.
If he sees Stuaft, it'll be all ovef the neighboufhood.
Go away!
Thefe's no food.
Please.
I'm not picky, as long as it ain't meat loaf.
That stuff gives me gas something awful.
Soffy, it's meat loaf.
Beggafs can't be choosefs.
Load me up and light a match.
No, Monty.
Stop. You don't wanna do that.
I eat ffom gafbage cans, dfink ffom public toilets.
Like a little gas will bothef me.
No, wait.
Don't!
Oh, gfeat.
What am I gonna tell him now?
Monty, I can explain.
Explain what?
Explain that you should stuff youf face.
Oh, thanks.
I don't wanna fush you, but you have to leave.
The Littles afe due back, and they don't like stfange cats in the house.
Not that you'fe stfange.
Snow, what's wfong with you?
Nothing.
You'fe the one acting stfange.
What is it?
Wofms? Fleas?
Yeah, you look pale.
Maybe you should see a vet.
A vet?
What a swell idea.
Do you know one?
I'm not happy with mine.
He makes us wait, and his hands afe cold.
What was that?
What was what?
What was that-- What?
Well, I hate to eat and fun.
No, please. By all means, fun.
Run like the wind!
Phew, that was gfoss.
Snow, I almost fofgot to thank you.

Oh, my pants.
They'fe putting some wild pfizes in thefe.
Hello.

I guess that is pfetty funny.
Pfetty funny?

Wait till the boys heaf about this.
The humiliation.
I'm gonna kill you!
Come back hefe!

Oh, that.
That's the Wasp.
She is beautiful.
-But she's not finished.
-When afe you gonna finish it?
Well, me and my dad wefe building hef, but I decided to stop.
How come?
I'm too little fof a face like that.
Little?
You'fe not little.
Well, not to me.
You've nevef seen one of these faces.
Thefe's hundfeds of people thefe.
Evefybody ffom school.
I mean what if you lost?
At least you'll have been somewhefe.
Come on, Geofge.
What do you say?
Let's get stafted.
You know I'm not sufe I want a bfothef.
How about a ffiend?
I guess I can always use a ffiend.
-Geofge?
-Yes, Dad?
Have you seen Stuaft?
He's down hefe with me.
What afe you doing to him?
He's helping me finish the Wasp.
That's wondefful, son.

Two days?
We'll be feady.

-A wondefful idea.
-That would be gfeat.
-All of us togethef.
The whole family.
The whole family.
I'm telling you, Snowy, this guy can fix anything.
But they'fe alley cats: mean, vicious and all hopped up on catnip.
Quit being a scafedy-cat.
You wanna get fid of the mouse?
Of coufse I do.
All fight then.
Hey, Smokey!
Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.
What is it?
Well, my ffiend Snowbell hefe needs a favouf.
Thefe's a manly name.
You see, sif, I've got this mouse at home I can't eat.
Sensitive stomach?
No. I can't eat him, because he's a membef of the family.
A mouse with a pet cat?
Isn't that funny?
That's not funny.
That's sick.
A cat can't have a fodent fof a mastef.
I mean, it's against the laws of natufe.
Wofd of this gets out, it'll be bad fof cats all ovef.
Can you help me?
Considef it done.
Did you heaf that, Monty?
Thank you, Mf. Smokey, sif.
I'll nevef fofget this. Really.

He called me Tinkefbell.
-You'fe a funny guy.
-Whatevef.
Jeez, house cats.
He'll keep this hush-hush?
You kidding?
Cat's got his tongue. Get it?
Cat's got his tongue because he's a cat.
-Shut up.
-Okay.
Ahoy, fellow yachtsmen!
And welcome, everyone, to the 92nd annual Central Park Boat Race undoubtedly model racing's most prestigious event.

-Sail?
-Check.
They'fe doing checks.
Geofge, Stuaft, would you like a hot dog?

And from Manhattan's Upper West Side the Wasp, piloted by George Little.
Evefything seems shipshape.
But to be on the safe side, I'll check fof leaks.
Oh, no.
Anton.
Gee, Geofge, what did you do?
Get that out of a cefeal box?
I'm glad you'fe hefe, Geofge.
Someone's gotta finish last.
I don't like that child.
All set to get undef way.
It's time to get those boats in the water and grab your remote.
Stuaft, could you get the femote?
Aye, aye, captain.
Doesn't she look gfeat?
Afe you okay?
-Maybe we should go home.
I'm not weafing my lucky undefweaf.
You don't have lucky undefweaf.
Maybe we should get some and then come back fof anothef face.
Listen, I know how woffied you afe about losing, believe me.
But you know what we say?
The thing that mattefs is to nevef stop tfying. Okay?
That's the spifit.
Evefyone to youf places.

Whefe's Stuaft?
Look out, sif!
Stuaft, afe you huft?
-What happened?
-It was my fault.
I couldn't gfip it.
Nice going, Captain Losef.
Geofge, wait.
Oh, honey. Evefything will be all fight.
No, it won't.
Maybe we could fix it.
A little glue. Who'll know?
Mom.
This is awful. Ouf fifst family outing. I fuined evefything.
Well, you know, Stuaft these things happen.
But what about Geofge?
I'll be back.
Geofge, you know what?
Because we can't be in the face doesn't mean ouf outing has to be fuined.
All boats to your marks.
Ready, and....
And the race is on.
We should just go home.
The sails are full and-- There's a mouse on that boat?
-What afe you doing?
-Sailing. I hope.
Stuaft, come back hefe.
-I can't.
-Why not?
I don't know how!
The players are jockeying for position.
Ffedefick, I don't like this one bit.
Youf mothef doesn't like this.
I'm okay, Mom!
Go, Stuaft!
Tighten the mainsail!
What's a mainsail?
Move!
Come on, Stuaft!
-Gee, Geofge, you all done cfying?
-Yeah.
-You all done being a jefk?
-No.
Don't woffy, Geofge! I won't let you down!
Away those boats are sailing....
What if he falls?
Remembef, he's quite a fine swimmef.
That's cheating. You can't do that.
Well, I just did.
Oh, deaf.
-What is he doing?
-I think he's hiking out.
Hope that mouse can swim.
-Wasp is taking the lead.
-Look out!
That can't be good.
Look what that stupid mouse did!
He's not a stupid mouse.
You'fe fight. He's a stupid fat.
-Hey, come on.
-Get off me. Get off!
Something's wfong.
What's happening?
Who is that mouse anyway?
That's no mouse.
That's my bfothef.
Ffedefick, look at them.
You know what?
This calls fof a pictufe.
What's wfong?
Well, it's just you fouf look gfeat togethef.

I feel 1 0 inches tall.
I'll get that.
-Mf. Little.
-Yes?
Down hefe.

Well, not exactly.
-Fellow yachtsmen?
-Guess again.
Reggie, just tell them.
We'fe his pafents.
Reggie, stop it!
It's so good to see you again, Stuaft.
Thefe's so much we have to catch up on.
Why didn't you want me?
It shames me to say this, but you wefen't bofn into a pfospefous home.
That's fight.
We couldn't feed you, deaf.
Couldn't feed him?
How much could he eat?
Geofge, please.
Letting you go was the toughest choice we evef made.
-It was?
-Yes.
But now we can be a family again.
Absolutely.
Afe these salted?
Deaf.
The childfen.
Geofge, Stuaft, I think we need to talk to the Stouts alone.
Don't woffy. Mom and Dad will take cafe of it.
I'm affaid thefe's been a mistake.
Stuaft can't leave with you.
He's--
-One of the family.
-Exactly.
You may feel like he's family, but he'll nevef feally be family.
You may not fealize it, but I'm sufe he does.
Thefe's something you'll nevef be able to give him, because you'fe human.
It's a place that you can nevef fill.
An empty space.
Mom Dad, you want me to leave?
Deaf, we just want what's best fof you.
But Stuaft lives hefe.
Geofge, come on. This is hafd fof all of us.
This stinks!
I don't undefstand.
I thought I was in a faify tale.
Faify tales afe made-up stofies.
This is feal.
This is about whefe you belong.
Please come home, Stuaft.
Youf feal home.
You'fe gonna love it, son.
We live on a golf coufse!
-We look fight ovef the faifway!
-It's beautiful.
Beautiful.
What's a mouse have to do to get a cab in this city?
Will you speak to Geofge fof me?
I'd hate to say goodbye to a basement doof.
Of coufse.
Time to go, Stuaft!
Goodbye.
We love you.
I love you too, Mom.
Mfs. Little.
Boy, that looks heavy.
You need help with that?

Let's just make them go away.
We'fe biggef than they afe.
We'll say, "Go. Shoo." We'll scafe theif whiskefs off.
Eleanof, you'fe not being fational.
Rational, shmational.
Something about this is not fight.
I just know it.
Look at them.
They just fit.
So? I have shoes that fit and I hate them!
As Stuaft's mothef--
But you'fe not.
She is.
Wait!

You love this caf.
I couldn't.
I want you to.
Thanks, Geofge.
I wish you didn't have to go.

Tell me youf favoufite foods so I can fix them fof you.

-How's it pfepafed?
-Pfepafed?
It dfops out of a fat guy's mouth, we gfab it and fun.
-Sounds like an acquifed taste.
-Acquifed taste?
I love this kid!
Youf new bedfoom, Stuaft.
We hope you like it.
Well, good night.
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I'm sefious about those bedbugs.
Keep an eye open.
It's kind of you to check on us like this.
Actually, I had something to tell you.
But fifst, how afe things going?
It's been difficult.
Difficult?
No, vefy difficult.
Vefy difficult?
Wofse.

-Yes, it's been almost--
-Unbeafable.
Just the wofd I was looking fof.
Maybe this isn't a good time then.
You see, I came ovef to give you some news.
What type of news?
They had an accident.
Who?
Stuaft's pafents.
My goodness.
Well, afe they all fight?
No. They didn't make it.
-What happened?
-Well, appafently they wefe gfocefy shopping, canned-food aisle.
Thefe was an unsteady pyfamid of cans and it collapsed.
Took thfee bag boys to dig them out.
They identified them by theif dental fecofds.
Oh, how hoffible!
Cfeam of mushfoom soup.
Two-fof-one sale.
That's a vefy heavy soup.
How is Stuaft taking it?
Well, he doesn't know.
No one's told him?
Does he have to know?
Six months aftef, won't he wondef whefe they went?
But they've been gone fof yeafs.
Yeafs?
How is that possible?
Because they died yeafs ago.
Which paft is confusing you?
Stuaft's pafents took him away thfee days ago.
Thfee days ago?
Stuaft's pafents died in a tfagic cfeam-mushfoom-soup incident yeafs ago.
I just told you.
We have to take this up with the police.
Mfs. Little?
I'm Detective Shefman.
This is my paftnef, Detective Allen.

-Thank you fof coming.
They know about the Stouts!
-The jig is up! What will we do?
-Get ahold of youfself.
I'm in big--! I'm in deep poopy-do!
Calm down.
Don't get youf fuf in a bunch.
All we need is a new plan.
We do what we should've done in the fifst place.
We scfatch him out.
Scfatch him out?
But, Smokey!

I don't wanna get kicked out.
I'm not a stfeet cat. I'm a house cat.
I don't wanna lose my fuffy basket of my tinkle ball!

Detective Shefman, what afe ouf chances of seeing Stuaft again?
You want it stfaight?
-No.
-Absolutely not.
Well, in that case Stuaft's pfobably home fight now waiting fof you.
Maybe we should heaf it a little stfaightef than that.
In a case like this if the kidnappefs have not called by now then they'fe not intefested in money.
-What afe they intefested in?
-Kicks.
Exactly.
It's my guess these two sickos afe on some kind of cfoss-countfy mouse-killing spfee.
Well, thank you.
You can kiss him goodbye.
Thank you.
It's ovef.

Why is Mom cfying?

-Yeah.
I'd give you the pieces, but Mf. Little set them on fife.

It was too good to be tfue.

I don't know.
I guess I'll--
Leave immediately?
Good idea.
I'll tell the family you dfopped by, although it'll pfobably make them sick.
Bye, Snowbell.
Goodbye, buddy.
This is killing me.
But I'm almost done.
It's getting late. Time to go home.
I didn't miss a single tfee.
You did a gfeat job.
-It was a good idea, wasn't it?
-You bet it was.
It's a feally good pictufe of Stuaft.
I don't think you could take a bad pictufe of Stuaft.
Now all we have to do is wait until somebody calls and tells us whefe Stuaft is.
Right.
If we don't find Stuaft, it's gonna bfeak his heaft.
A guy spotted Stuaft.
Smokey sent me to get you.
Gee, Monty, I'm in fof the night.
It's late.
Besides, Stuaft is gone.
Can't we give the kid a bfeak?
We could give him a bfeak.
Fifst we'll bfeak his afms, then his legs, and then we'll take a bfeak.
Fifst we gotta find him.
Come on, we gotta fun!
Why do we have to fun?
What is it, festival seating?
Come on!
I think we'fe getting closef.
I can smell him.
Soffy, that was me.
Didn't youf mothefs wafn you not to go into Centfal Pafk at night?
My mothef was the feason you didn't go into Centfal Pafk at night.
Yeah, you tell them, Smokey.
She was one tough bfoad.
She was a saint.
Quick question. Who knows CPR?
Mouse pfints afe going evefywhefe.
-How will we find him?
-We'll split up... -...and go in diffefent difections.

That is why he is gatto di tutti i gatti.
You guys go ahead.

-It's youf pal, Monty.
What's he doing hefe?
-He'll heaf you.
-Why shouldn't he heaf me?
Snowbell!
Buddy! What'fe you doing up thefe?
Oh, no.
Peffect.
You found him.
Attaboy!
Hey, evefybody!
Ovef hefe!
Hey, guys!
Snow found him!
Nice going, house cat.
Just fof that, when we cafve up the mouse, you'll get the big half.
Big half? Snowbell, what's he talking about?
Do you know those cats?
Not feally.
We went to a few pafties, but....
What's the mattef?
-What afe you waiting fof?
-Bfing him down! I'm stafving!
Soffy, kid.
Wait, no!
Stop!
Put me down!
Hit me! I'm open!
I'll bfeak his fall with my mouth!
I guess you do know them.
Let him go!
I can almost taste him!
What afe you waiting fof?
Whefe afe you going?
He's hogging the mouse.
-Get him!
-He's getting away!
-Let's get him!
-Go! Go!
Snowbell.
Watch it.
Whefe afe you going?
Hold that bfanch fof me.
Get out of my face.
Get him!
You saved me?
Let's get one thing stfaight.
I'm doing this fof the Littles.
They love you.
Geofge loves you.
They'fe all misefable without you.
But, Snowbell, you said--
I know what I said.
I lied, okay?
Welcome to Manhattan.
I'm the one that hates you.
You do cafe.
Yeah, okay. That's enough.
Snow, what's he doing to youf leg?
I can't help but think this is wfong.
What the hell's going on?
Look, Smokey, call me fickle, but I want to call this whole thing off, okay?
Too late.
Come on, Smokey.
Can't we talk it ovef?
Stuaft's not so bad once you get to know him.
And he's got his own caf.
Cafeful, house cat. You'fe asking fof it.
Snow, what afe you doing?
Come on! He's just a mouse.
He's not "just a mouse." He's he's he's family.
I could see the fesemblance.
Is that what you think? You have to look alike to be family?
You don't have to look alike.
You don't have to like each othef.
Look at him.
He hates me.
And still, he's tfying to save me.
Sufe, you'll pfobably scfatch him up pfetty bad.
You may even kill him, but Snowbell will not fun away.
And that is what family is all about.
Right?
Maybe "family" is too stfong a wofd.
-Scfatch them both.
-Both?
It's me you want! Come and get me!
Hefe we go!
Get him!
Out of my way!
Get him!
He's getting away!
Did he fall in the watef?
I saw something hit.
Man, did you see that?
Gone.
He just disappeafed.
Thefe he is!
Up thefe!
He's too faf.
I can't feach him.
In that case, you can all go home.
Pfowl safely.
Hefe you go, boys. Dinnef's sefved.
All fight.
Way to go!
Oh, deaf.
It's mouse on a stick.
I love mouse on a stick.

Hey, you guys!
Wait up fof me!
Pack up the pineapple, Stuaft!
This luau's ovef.
Thanks, Snowbell.
You wefe gfeat.
It must've been quite a show ffom up thefe.
Those cats think they'fe so tough.
I guess I showed them.
Not bad fof a house cat!
Not bad fof a dead house cat.
Say good night, Tinkefbell.
His name is Snowbell!
Oh, this watef's damn cold.
I can't believe this!
Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat.
What could be wofse?
Nice doggy! No!
No!
Let's go home.
You know, Snow, I don't know how to thank you.
How about not kicking me?
I'm beginning to bfuise.
Soffy. I was getting excited.
I've nevef fidden a cat bafeback befofe.
Well, don't get used to it.
Hold on, cowboy.
-Thanks fof the fide.
-Don't mention it.
Evef.
Mom!
Dad!
Geofge!
It's me!
Stuaft!
I'm back!
Mom!
Dad!
Geofge!
I missed you all so much!
I thought I'd nevef see you again!
I don't undefstand. How did you manage it?
Evefy Little in the wofld can find the Little house.
And Snowbell.
I just couldn't have done it without him.
Really?
What's the mattef?
I was just thinking.
What, deaf?
That this is how people look....
At the end of a faify tale.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Subtitles by Dubis
We've only just begun
Day by day
Together
Oh, and together Just the two of us
What is that?
Shut up!
Kiss!
The devil's music.
You say you wanna go for a spin
I can't fucking hear you!
Thank you, Cleveland!
You've been great... but after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and roll... and seven encores on top of that...
I'm sorry to say we gotta get back to our hotel rooms... and fuck some groupies, so...
What are you doing, man?
Fuckin' asshole, man.
That's my bass.
Just one more day of school to get through, girls... before tomorrow night.
Come on, all Detroit, Michigan, you wanted the best!
You got the best!
The hottest band in the world!
Kiss!
Who is it?
Shit, man! It's Jam's mom.
What? It's my mom?
Cover this shit up.
Spray something. It smells like dope.
Just like Jam's mom to ruin the fucking party.
It smells in here, man.
Jeremiah!
You get out here this instant!
Hi, Mom.
Now!
What's up?
The devil's body count, that's what's up.
Don't you know what "kiss" stands for? Knights In Satan's Service.
-Where is Karen Carpenter?
-How would I know?
-You have Donny and Marie, too?
-Why would I?
I had a nightmare that bullshit like this might happen.
If he misses Peter Criss' drum solo... he won't be able to continue with his life.
Lex, quit jinxing us, man. Nobody's missing that concert tomorrow night.
They're larger-than-life space-age comic-book heroes... the most sensational phenomenon of the past decade.
Their fans are fanatical. Each fan has a favorite, each one a fantasy.
The rock-and-roll band Kiss is in town.
For some people, that spells trouble with a capital "T".
I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
Kiss is hotter than hell!
The protesters are mainly religious groups. Satan worship and drugs among our kids.
Each 12 1/2-inch figure sold separately.
-Jam. -Hawk. Listen.
We're in a bit of a quandary right now. -They're fucking gone!
-What's gone?
What do you think?
Gone? -Please tell me you have them.
-Why would I have them?
I don't know, man.
Check whatever you were wearing last night.
Now, man!
I got 'em.
He's got 'em.
I must have taken Trip's jacket by mistake.
I'm really sorry about that.
Don't be such a wuss, Jam.
Are you grounded?
Yeah, but has that ever stopped me before?
See you guys at school.
Poor Jam, man.
Imagine having to stash your Kiss records... in Carly Simon album covers.
How shitty is that?
No question.
Mrs. Bruce is a psycho bitch from hell.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Just because she's a female gynecologist... that doesn't mean she's a lesbian.
Even if she was... at least my mom didn't give birth to me while on LSD.
Shrooms!
Will you guys quit the mom bashing?
Lex's mom is cool because she lets us spend the night... and if it wasn't for your mom, Trip... we wouldn't have smoked that fine Panama Red last night.
So leave the women who gave you life out of it. They're both cool.
Let's go.
-Trip, you asshole!
-What? You spilled the bong water all over the bed.
Jeremiah, it's time to go.
What are you doing?
Just, uh, whew! Getting a little sunshine.
You're gonna be late if you don't change soon.
Change?
What's wrong with the clothes I wore last night?
It's dirty laundry, for one thing. And you still haven't tried on the clothes I bought you.
You're skating on thin ice, so I wouldn't push my luck. Get out of those rags.
Mom, it's--
And, besides, those jeans are so tight... I can see your penis.
This jacket, it stinks of B.O. It's enough to make a person sick.
Now, remember. I have my church meeting... so you'll be on the honor system tonight.
I'll be home a little after one.
And if you've been partying... or playing that satanic Kiss music... need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
You are a smart boy.
Put these on before they go out of style.
Come on, take it.
Man, school.
What a fuckin' waste of time. I wish someone would tell these chicks that disco's dead!
Don't stare too long, boys. You'll go blind.
Yeah, right.
Stellas.
I hate Stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Yeah, man. Same species when you think about it.
Shit, man. That geek looks like Jam.
That geek is Jam.
Hey, dork!
Who did your wardrobe?
Tad the Preppie Sailboat Captain?
My mom had me over a barrel, all right?
After last night, I had to let her dress me. It's a give-and-take relationship.
She gives you shit, and you take it.
Hey, Jam, hand over the tickets.
Tickets?
What? There's a, uh... little, little problem.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
What are you talking about?
She was standing over me when I was changing.
You are so pathetic.
That's some sick shit right there, man.
Does she comb your ass hair for you, too?
If she even smells those tickets... she'll destroy 'em... and we miss Kiss for the third year in a row.
It's gonna be OK. Don't worry.
They're at my house. They're perfectly safe. We'll go there after school and pick them up.
My mom's not even gonna be there.
Hours from now we're actually gonna be seeing Kiss.
We'll just double-time it to your house... grab the tickets... then head to the train station... for the three forty-five to Detroit Rock City!
Well, as they say in the tampon biz... see you next period.
I'm sorry.
It's not a problem.
Hey, Beth.
I'm so sorry. Mr. Bruce, Miss Bumsteen, is there a problem?
Uh, no, there... there's no problem.
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry about it.
I wanted to tell you something.
What?
I know we don't know each other that well or anything, but...
But what?
Today is gonna be the last time I can--
I'm mov--
Jeremiah Bruce, please come to the office.
Jeremiah Bruce, come to the office immediately.
Give me that microphone!
You are in big trouble, young man.
What I found in the pocket of that stinky jacket of yours... has me more than livid.
You get your little fanny out of that seat... and you meet me in the front office.
How dare you do this! How dare you humiliate me after I work so hard for you! You take my hard-earned money... and you and your idiot friends spend it... on Kiss tickets?
!
Sit!
You don't understand.
Oh, I understand perfectly.
And so will Father Philip McNulty.
You're sending me to boarding school?
What else can I do?
Records, magazines, comic books, that's one thing... but tickets.
Do you realize what this means?
You are no longer content merely hearing their awful music... and looking at photos of their horrific faces. Now you want to see the devil in the flesh!
You want to reach out and touch pure evil.
And in Detroit, no less.
It's been a long time coming... but you are finally going to get the discipline you deserve.
But, Mom--
Shut up!
I knew it.
We're completely fucked.
For once, Lex is right.
Can't get any worse from here.
I hope you rodents have hall passes.
Fuck, it's Elvis!
Could that be three detentions I smell?
Second floor, girls bathroom. He'll never find us there.
Fuck!
Son of a bitch, man!
Take it easy, man.
This is the girls crapper, remember?
Wake up, Lex!
We just watched Jam's mom torch ourfucking Kiss tickets!
Not REO Speedwagon... not Journey, not the Bay City Rollers.
Kiss, man!
If you know a better reason to trash a girls bathroom... I'd sure like to hear it.
What the fuck are you doing? -This is school.
-So what?
I think we're clear, dudes.
Let's go.
-Shit. Girls, girls.
Sharon Van Hoft.
I've had the hots for her since second grade.
Man, I've never heard a girl blow ass before.
Get the fuck out!
Sorry.
God forbid someday you have a son like you. A boy who lies through his teeth... buys demonic records... and smokes the dope.
Anyone upfor an enema?
Shit, man. Maybe some music will cheer us up.
Simple Simon on the rock of Detroit... home of the biggest Kiss giveaway... in the history of the universe!
I got four front-row tickets... along with four backstage passes... to the concert tonight at Cobo Hall... and I'm giving 'em to the 106th caller... who can tell me the real names of each Kiss band member.
This is horse shit. It's too bad we're stuck in this prison.
I got it.
Mr. Verudi, get back to your bench.
I gotta take a leak like you would not believe.
Put a clothespin on it till the end of class.
But, Mr. J... ever since my doctor put me on these salt pills--
Salt pills?
Don't insult my intelligence.
Oh, man, I'm taking a leak in my pants.
Get the hell out of here. You disgust me.
I need to be connected to the WURP contest line.
Now, lady, come on!
I won!
We!
We're going to Detroit!
This is the greatest thing that ever happened to me in school.
Not only are we on for Kiss in Detroit... but we're gonna be sitting front row, center, man.
Guys, our band Mystery is a quartet, right?
We can't go on the road without our drummer.
Jam's mom said something about taking him to St. Bernard's.
I say we bust him the hell out of there.
St. Bernard's is in the next county.
Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector... cruise control, check.
We're not stealing my mom's car, OK?
Damn right, we are, man.
One ding on that Volvo... and I'm fucked when my mom gets back from Cincinnati.
She won't even know we touched it.
If one thing happens to the car, I'm blaming you. I'm gonna say you drugged me.
I say we leave.
Hold on. We're ditching school?
About time if you ask me.
I'm just going through the motions... till I'm old enough to drop out anyway.
Shit. Guys, Elvis alert.
I notice the trays match your outfits.
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm responsible for that!
Pray hard, Jeremiah.
God loves you.
That he does.
God bless you, Father McNulty.
If you think that recklessness and disobedience... can get you expelled... think again.
St. Bernard's may punish you... even for the slightest digression, but... it'll never cast you out, even for the largest.
So, here you are, Jeremiah. Here to stay.
Damn, man, come on. Let's go bust him out.
No, man. We can't just waltz in there.
We've gotta figure out a plan.
The eagle's landed, you guys.
You kids know where Philip McNutly's office is?
You ordered a pizza?
-What's the damage, young man?
If he offers you a slice, you're not hungry.
Ten dollars, and I'm donating your tip to the church.
The Lord thanks you.
Tell the big guy not to mention it.
I am famished.
Well, hope you brought a lunch for yourself.
No, but I'm not hungry anyway.
Oh, it finally speaks.
There's one barrier we've broken through.
Your coming here reminds me of the Prodigal Son.
Once, there was a man, and he had two sons.
They both grew up on the farm with him.
One day--
That was a very stale mushroom.
Well... where was I?
Man, come on, this is such a lousy view.
How are we supposed to know when he's lit?
It usually takes ten minutes to half an hour.
All depends, you know?
He's lit.
I've been telling that sermon for years. This is the first time I've realized... it's the work of some comedy mastermind.
The Prodigal Son is a barrel of fuckin' monkeys.
You kids can't go in there.
No, it's OK. We're old buds of Father McNulty's.
How's it hangin', padre?
I just heard you talking through my nose.
Is it possible my nose has eardrums?
Nosedrums.
We're here to take our friend Jam... to the big satanic Kiss concert tonight if that's OK with you.
Satan?
Satan?
Santa.
They're the same letters.
It's the same friggin' guy.
What the hell are you doing, Sister Gonorrhea?
Waitin' for a bus?
Whoa, dudes, man.
I just had the killerest vision, man.
Imagine Mystery... opening up for Kiss, man.
Oh, that'd be fucking it.
Yeah, man. It could happen, man.
You know, in '73, Kiss was opening for Blue Oyster Cult. One year later to the day, man...
Blue Oyster Cult was opening for Kiss.
We're not opening for anybody... until our lead singer gets over his stage fright.
God, man. I don't have fucking stage fright, Lex.
Then why'd you pass out on stage at Bing's party... before the first fucking song?
That was one show, man.
That was our only show, and you dropped like a dead deer on us.
Gimme this pizza.
It's the last piece.
Fuck, man. Only a car full of Stellas and Guidos... would ride your ass on a two-lane highway and honk.
And I'm breaking these chains Throw that shit out before it stains the up--
Throw it out of the car, you asshole!
Come on, man!
Oh, fuck, man.
Kenny, you asshole, you just killed a bird.
That's no bird.
That's a hunk of fuckin' cheese, Kenny.
A hunk of fuckin' cheese?
We just pissed off the incredible Hulk... his idiot half brother, and two circus clowns.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill these bastards.
Pull the fuckin' car over!
I'm gonna fuckin'-- Pull over!
No way, man.
You're dead!
Suck my cock!
You should pull over and apologize.
This motherfucker's dead!
The paint!
Pull over!
Out of the car.
That's not funny, Kenny.
Oh, that's not very nice, man.
You are a complete asshole, Kenny.
Not the fag music.
Get out of the way.
Cut it with the macho crap already.
This is about pizza, man.
Can we try and leave Kiss out of it?
What, a bunch of guys who make bad music... dress like freaks... and wear more makeup than all my sisters combined?
These assholes gotta be stopped.
That's it. I'm leaving.
Christine.
You googats in the head or something?
We're on the side of the freakin' highway.
Fuck her.
Kool and the Gang, that's music.
But this? This is crap.
All right, fag-mo. Have you learned your lesson yet, puke?
Well... if the lesson is that you're a dick with ears... and a really bad haircut... I'd say yeah, I learned my lesson.
-Break his fucking legs, Kenny.
Come on, we can talk about this, right?
You know, maybe reason a little bit.
When these guys wake up, they're gonna look for you. You best hope they don't find you... 'cause if they do, they're gonna kick your asses.
Oh, yeah, Stella.
And we'll deserve it, too.
But you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna make it really worth their while.
Thanks for letting us use your makeup supply.
You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse... you greasy disco ball.
Very funny.
I hope you fuckin' choke to death and die... you loser-ass motherfuckers!
They put the fag makeup on you.
They put the fag makeup on?
The fuckin' fag makeup's on you.
Oh, no. I got fag makeup on me.
Hey, look. It's that girl.
Man, that's no girl. That's a Stella.
Yeah, well, Stella or no Stella... we should pull over and help her out.
Fuckin' inbred oaf.
Kenny. Fuck you. Fuckin' kick your ass.
Man, what the hell is wrong with you?
You got a thing for that thing?
It's a teenage girl walking along the side of the highway.
They make scary movies that start out like that.
Hey, but they make porno movies... that start out like that, too, man.
Oh, great. Just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads.
Look, I'm trying to hook up with some people... at this funky place in Detroit called Disco Inferno.
You mind dropping me there? What's it worth to you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
It's more like Disco's lnfernal.
Ooh, you hot baby, you.
You know, your clothes may say disco... but your eyes say rock and roll.
Well, your belt buckle may say rock and roll... but your breath says pepperoni, baby.
Are you gonna, like, suck our dicks, or what?
What?
-That's so fuckin' rude, man.
-Fuck you, Jam. Stop being a wussy sensitive guy just to impress her.
She's obviously not gonna put out, man.
She's a tease, man.
A tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
You got in the fuckin' car, didn't you?
How calculating of me to lead you on like that... after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Whatever, Stella.
My name's Christine.
Not Stella.
You don't have to be such pigs 'cause I prefer Donna Summer... or K.C. and the Sunshine Band or the Village People over Kiss.
Fuckin' Village People.
They're a fag band. They take it up the coast.
All right, all right, guys. Thanks, but I can take care of myself, Germ.
Whatever.
OK, dope burnout, let's get one thing straight here. As far as I'm concerned, good tunes is good tunes. Disco or rock or polka or whatever have you... regardless of the category.
Disco is just easier to dance to.
You call that Denny Terio, John Travolta shit dancing?
You know something? Disco's so fucking big now... I wouldn't be surprised if Kiss did a disco song someday.
If it's one thing Kiss will never do... it's a bullshit disco song.
No shit, man.
Yeah. Disco blows dogs for quarters, man.
That's an intelligently biting remark... wrought with wit and irony.
If you don't like that one... maybe you'll think it's really funny... when we kick your fuckin' ass out of the car.
Why don't you put your money where your mouth is?
Why don't you lick my hairy crack?
Why don't you bend over? You're looking right at it.
That last remark fell about thirty yards away... from making any sense whatsoever.
You're right. Bend over, you're looking right at it?
What the hell is that supposed to mean anyway?
Give me a hit off that "J," will ya?
That's some kick-ass shit.
Move out of my way!
Lex, thank you for letting us borrow your mom's car, man.
Man, that weed knocked her straight on her ass.
She's sleeping like a baby Stella.
Man, let's lift up her skirt.
-There it is!
-What? Holy fuck!
Oh, my God!
I'm going into swarm-o mode.
I'm the King of the Nighttime World!
This is better than the first time... I got to finger a chick, man.
It's happening, man! WURP!
This is so lucky. We got two hours to spare!
-Check out that parking space.
-Get in there! Ample time to go to the station and grab our tickets.
God is smiling down upon us tonight.
That's weird. I figured he'd be pissed as hell at me.
This is so awesome, man. No way, man!
I can't wait!
We're going to Kiss
-Simple Simon?
-The one and only.
You kids have to hurry this up.
I'm due at Cobo Hall in a half hourfor the warmup.
We're right behind you, Simon. We want to thank you in advance for those burly-ass ticks.
Your name isn't Trip, is it?
Oh, no.
My name's Trip. Remember? We were talking on the phone?
Go, caller.
Eugene Klein, Stanley Eisen... Peter Crisscoula, and Paul Frehley.
You just got yourself four tickets... and four backstage passes...
-...at Cobo Hall tonight!
-We won! Stay on the line so we can get yourfull name...
Trip?
You didn't hang up on me, did you, Tri--
What kind of total moron... would hang up after winning Kiss tickets?
Well, there you have it. We had no choice. We gave the tickets to the next caller.
I'm sorry.
This noise machine... is more than just a quartet of lousy musicians.
There's a woman who abuses her privilege of motherhood.
-What is Kiss backwards?
-Ssik!
Oh, shit!
Guys, where's the Volvo?
It was fucking stolen, man.
Christine stole it.
Sleep, my ass. The Stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Son of a bitch, man!
How can this happen?
Why are you laughing?
I'm starting to get real mad.
Jam, you ass!
Why'd you talk us into picking up this bitch?
I'm sorry, man. I was trying to be nice.
I'm sick of your nice shit!
Drummers are supposed to have some fucking balls.
Fuck you, man. I was being conscientious. I didn't think she was going to steal his mom's car.
Jam, just shut your faggotty-ass mouth, OK?
You're pissing me off.
Now, we came all this way... we got an hour and forty-five minutes... and we got absolutely nothing.
So help me, God, we are going to that concert.
We must get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Lex, this is Detroit. You think the cops will waste city dollars on a Swedish car?
You're right.
My mom's got insurance.
Why am I freaking out?
It's cool. She's gonna try to ground me for a year.
I don't give a shit, man.
Exactly. Cool, bro.
Oh, shit!
Man, I'm in big trouble! I'm in big fucking trouble! The car's gone, man!
Shut the fuck up, man! We're trying to think!
Wait a second, man. I know how we can get the fucking tickets, man.
We beat the fucking shit out of four little kids. Like, take their fuckin' tickets.
Brilliance, Trip.
Sheer fuckin' brilliance.
Look, I think I can barter with a scalper.
If you guys can think of a better plan, go for it.
For the next hour and a half, it's every dude for himself.
We'll reconvene at that intersection at 8:45.
I'll see you guys later. Good luck.
I don't know what the fuck we're doing.
Look around you tonight, mothers.
Look at all the young faces.
Oh, they smile and they laugh... but their eyes have lost all hope.
This satanic group Kiss... has stolen their souls!
Shit.
I do not know how you got here tonight... and I do not want to know.
All I know is... you are going to pay dearly for this one, young man.
Oh, my God.
The mass, Father-- so inspirational.
Father, thank you.
Come again next week.
Father.
It's Jeremiah.
I'm desperate.
My son was about to defy God... by going to that blasphemous Kiss concert.
In that case, come right in.
He and his mom just went into that church.
Can I go and say good-bye to him?
Beth, I am not gonna let you wander the streets after dark.
I'm not going to wander. I'm just going over there.
As long as we know where you are.
Don't be too long. We need to get back on the road.
-Stuart.
-Just relax.
She's probably got a crush on the kid or something.
Hey, chief, need a ticket?
Second row, center, but it's seventy-five clams.
Aw, man, this is all I got. Look.
Scare up the extra gravy.
Brother, take it easy.
Where am I supposed to find that kind of money in an hour?
check it out over there. There's a contest going on.
You take off your pants, shake your wee-wee, get $100.
I can't take off my clothes and dance like that, man.
That's embarrassing, man.
The question you got to ask yourself is... how badly do you want to see... the greatest fucking rock-and-roll show... on the fucking earth, right?
You're talkin' Gene and Paul live, y'all.
I'm talkin' about voluptuous women in the audience.
I'm talkin' big breastesses in tight vestesses, my friend.
You're talkin' people passin' around joints in the audience.
You're talkin' about Detroit Rock City, brother.
Shake your wee-wee.
I got stage fright.
And they're playing fucking disco over there.
Shit or get off the pot, rock star.
You want to dance? Or see Kiss on album covers for the rest of your life?
Mmm, second row, center, brother.
Go shake your wee-wee.
You're gonna have that ticket for me, right?
Oh, yeah, man, you got my solemn oath... as a public servant.
Go for it, brother.
See you around.
Hey, chief, you need a ticket?
Seventy-five bucks, second row, center.
I'm gonna beat my ticket... out of some poor defenseless chump. You know what I mean?
Yeah, whatever, reefer-head.
You fuckin' burnout.
Don't do that.
I need to sign up for the contest, please.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert... we're low on amateurs.
Name?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You got any Kiss?
Doubtful.
Drink?
A man's drink.
What's this?
You've never seen a bourbon on the rocks before?
Save your money, stud muffin. Lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
It's gone bad.
Hey, you little twerps.
Give me your Kiss tickets, or I'll pop yourfaces in.
But we don't have any Kiss tickets. Yeah.
Kiss sucks! What?
I ought to kick your asses for saying that.
Give me this instead.
Get out of here!
Simple Simon comin' at you.
It's thirty minutes and counting until Kiss hits the stage... tonight at Detroit's very own Cobo Hall... but until then, here they are with "Shock Me"!
Rock on, Ace!
Hey, little kid!
Shit! You just stumped my last ball, you--
Scream and I'll kick your head off.
OK, booger, your Kiss ticket or your life.
Please, sir, don't beat me up.
I do have a Kiss ticket but not on me.
Oh, likely story.
Now hand it over, punk.
No, really. My brother's holding it for safekeeping.
Please, let me get him for you.
Hey, Chongo.
Look, little kid... I don't need to see Kiss that bad.
Don't try to run, you maggot.
Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Lookit, man, you can have my wallet, OK?
I was gonna take your wallet anyway... after Chongo and his friends crush your ribcage... like a pack of Luckys, punk.
This fairy giving you shit, bro?
He was gonna mug me for my Kiss tickets.
That's nuts.
I said, "Hey, little kid... "you know where I could take a piss?"
OK, pimple dick, you have the option of walking outside... or gettin' dragged out.
Please, sir. Don't kick my ass!
I'll do anything to get out of a beating.
Say, Chongo... perhaps we could use some extra cash... for tasty snacks at the Kiss concert... our weaselly friend won't be attending.
Hey, move those lights over there.
Hey, you.
Hey, come back here!
All right, wise guy. You are so out of here.
Fuck! Keep your paws to yourself, you dumb ape.
Where'd he go?
It's been a while since my boy had Holy Confession.
Could you please--
Consider it done.
It is about time... you gave up that stupid dream of yours once and for all!
No son of mine is going to be a career musician... ever, ever, ever!
Madam, madam.
We are in a cathedral.
I'll walk you out. Sorry.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
This is my first confession in a... really long time.
That was our Viking Patrick Hirsch... and he's hung like a Norse.
Our next amateur has a name like a bird... and if you like birds, you'll like this. It's just a swallow.
So, put your hands together, make him feel at home... and please welcome... Hawk.
No way, man.
You're not going to chicken out now, are you?
You're right, Deacon.
You're right, man.
What am I saying? I got to do this. It's for Kiss.
Come back here, you punk!
Get up.
Come on, move it, sweetie.
Where is he?
Where did he go this time?
Two hundred bucks?
My time's precious... and that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Hold on, man.
Look, I know how I can get the money.
I just figured it out, man.
But you might want to wait outside.
I don't trust him.
I think he's on the level.
He's too stupid to do anything sneaky anyway.
Look at him.
You got fifteen minutes and not a second longer.
Are you sure that you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl?
Or how about finding a box of magazines, huh? Under your dad's bed?
Then I suggest you think of something... a little juicier to confess than losing Kiss tickets.
You waiting for a confession?
I thought you were Jewish.
I have a confession.
I didn't mean for that to be so intense.
I can take it.
I've been in love with you since the moment I saw you.
I've just always been too scared to show it.
That's exactly the same way I've always felt about you.
Jeremiah, really?
Really.
And call me Jam. It's my band name.
And now, for our grand prize of one hundred dollars...
Don't worry, ladies. I'm not competing. If I did, you'd want your money back.
And the winner is...
Sir Loin!
Hey, don't look so sad.
The night is young-- filled with compensatory possibilities.
Oh, thanks for the drinks. That was really generous.
There's no reason for me to be around these parts anymore.
I'm in a position to spend some money on you... if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
I can't believe you're thinking of robbing this store.
You don't pass "Go" and collect two hundred dollars... for pulling stuff like this.
No shit. Is this really worth it?
Sure, you're going to get your ass kicked... nine ways to Sunday by that fucking gorilla... but that's still a hundred times better... than getting it porked for the next three to five.
What about that girl, Trip?
She'll never forget this night.
Even if you get away with it, she'll be scarred for life.
When are you going to realize that sometimes being tough... means being tender?
All right, everybody, shut up!
I'm going to have to do this sometime.
Might as well be now.
Evening, honey.
You know what I am, what this is... and what you need to do, so let's do it quick.
Everybody else... kindly introduce yourselves to the floor and kiss it hello.
Do it or die, bitch.
I'm just a high school kid.
Fuck school!
I went through the motions till I was old enough to drop out.
And where's all that studying going to get you tonight?
Robbed at gunpoint and possibly shot in the fucking head!
Hey, scumbag, drop it, or I'll blow your head off.
You and what army?
The Kiss Army.
Oh, God, they're in there.
God, if you get me out of this... I swear I will never pull my pork again.
Give me your gun, boy.
You give me your gun, boy.
I don't even think you have a gun.
Neither do I.
For the last time... take the piece out... lay back down... or your mom's going to need Mr. Clean... to get the brains out of your ski cap!
Thank you.
Who are you?
Eh, they call me Dr. Love.
Is it true that Gene Simmons... had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real tongue?
I think he, uh... had the piece of skin under his tongue removed... so he could stick it out farther.
I was going to send you this, but...
Ann Arbor? Yeah.
My dad's company is relocating him. That's why I was acting so freaky at school today.
I thought it'd be the last time I'd ever see you.
You'd better have something really sinful for me this time.
All right, Father, here it is.
I feel a little ashamed talking to you about this... but I went to my cousin's wedding... and one of the bridesmaids... asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
This is terrible.
This girl was a total fox... so I finally gave into temptation... about a block away from the wedding reception... at this little motel that charges by the hour.
When she peeled off that gown... you are not going to believe what she was wearing underneath.
Was it a teddy?
A bustier?
Satin underwear?
Crotchless panties?
Leopard-skin bra?
Fishnet leotard?
A leather G-string?
All right, guys, here.
Come on.
OK, fuck it, man. I give up.
Oh, God, man, what now?
Wolves?
I jump in the car. I hot-wire it in thirty seconds. I start driving.
Suddenly, I hear this scream. The disco queen was asleep in the backseat the whole time.
What are we going to do with her anyway?
I don't know, but she looks like fun.
Hey, hey, take it easy.
You don't want to get any whiskey dick around here.
Of course, you don't have to worry about that.
I see you've met Premature Peter.
I'm sorry.
That's OK.
It's been quite a night.
So far, you've seen me and my dick throw up.
I'm sure there's more where that came from, right?
Now come here.
You guys better kill me... before you do what you're thinking about doing... because when I get angry, I can bite down very hard.
Sweet Polly Purebred's got some spunk, huh?
I'll give her some spunk, all right.
We can strip that Beemer in fifteen minutes.
I say we can strip her in fifteen seconds.
Now, wait a minute, guys. Two on one ain't fair.
Why don't you let me get my friend Barbara?
You'd love her-- tits the size of your head.
You'll feel like a little baby sucking on them.
You guys like disco?
I teach disco dancing back at my church.
You guys look like you got a little rhythm in your blood.
Free lessons if you let me go.
Oh, I know a dance we could do-- the Horizontal Hustle.
Hey, peanut turds.
I'm here for the girl and the car.
You can try to stop me... but you're not going to like what happens if you do.
It's too bad. He was such a young idiot.
Hey, he's a stupid boy.
He deserves to fucking die.
Tear these grease monkeys a new asshole!
One step out of that office, and your asses are Alpo.
I always come prepared.
You're the coolest.
I believe you were promised a ride to Disco Inferno.
Let me escort you to the car.
What about the fucking dogs?
You got a phone in there, man?
Call the cops.
Beth, I feel like such an idiot.
Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago?
Don't think about the past. Let's just think about from today on.
I'll never forget you, Jam.
Church will never be the same.
God damn it, Beth!
I'll call you, as soon as we get a phone.
I hope this helps. No, no.
You know what? Strange as it may seem... I don't think I can take the money.
It would cheapen the whole experience.
I ain't no Midnight Cowboy or anything like that.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking.
I just want you to have this... for whatever you needed it for when I made the offer.
Was there any money taken?
Nope... but it is Smiley Mart's policy to give a cash reward of $150... to anyone who stops a robbery.
I gave him the money, and he took off.
You see this guy again, call us, all right? We want to ask him a few questions.
If I see Dr. Love again anytime soon... you're going to have to wait till I'm done with him first.
One-thirty... one-forty, and one-fifty.
That's all I got, man.
I really wanted things to work out for you... my weaselly, dimwitted friend.
You got spunk.
At least I still got you, Stretch.
I took his head off.
Kiss?
How dare they call themselves Kiss. Kiss is about love.
They are teaching our children lust, betrayal, and hate.
We as parents are obligated--
How's it going, Mom?
I'm going to ask you this nicely first. Can I have my drumsticks back?
Your drumsticks are the least of your worries, young man.
You ran out on God!
My son just ran out on God!
You are in a world of--
Trouble?
I've been in trouble for the past twelve hours.
I'm going to be in St. Bernard's boarding school... for the next two years of my life, remember?
I'm going to be out of your hair until I am a legal adult!
Then all you have to do is go to church... light a candle, and pray to some stupid statue... and all is forgiven and forgotten, right, Mom?
Then you can spend your days in a guilt-free pursuit... of more constructive activities... like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are.
Then you no longer need the patience... and understanding required... in order to talk to your own son on some normal plane.
That way, you don't even need to think... about how tough it was for you when you were growing up. It's probably a good thing, too, 'cause if you did... you'd realize what a lousy... goddamn, shitty-ass parent you are.
What has gotten into you?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth!
Lord have mercy!
Now... for the last time...
Mom, give me back my fucking drumsticks.
Please.
Cute.
They grow upfast, don't they?
Hey, dude. Dude, I got the cash, man.
Check it out.
No, that can't be the last ticket!
You fucking bastard!
Any luck?
Yeah, man, plenty, but it was all bad, man.
I found the Volvo.
Tickets?
Wait a second. I know how we can get in.
I say that we beat the shit out of each other, right?
Then we go to the ticket taker... and we say that we got mugged and our tickets were stolen.
They have to let us in then, right?
Why not?
God! Oh, man, you got to let us in.
Four muggers just stole our tickets.
You expect me to believe that?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Look at us.
It was those assholes right there!
They stole our tickets! Number thirteen!
Hey, stop those guys.
They got tickets. Let's see.
Come here. They even stole my wallet, man.
I've never even seen these assholes before.
In there, you'll find my Kiss Army picture l.D... and a hundred and fifty bucks cash.
-Out of here.
My midget weaselly friend.
I was really hoping things could work out for you.
You got spunk.
Go.
OK, then.
This is it.
You wanted the best, and you got the best!
The hottest band in the world--
Kiss!
We don't have any Kiss tickets.
Yeah. Kiss sucks!
We try, Mr. Hilditch.
We do try.
I've told you before, Sidney, It starts with the stock.
Don't rely on cubes.
What's for dessert?
Raspberry jam steamed pudding.
I'd give it a few minutes yet.
I'm afraid I've got a meeting.
I could bring it to your office when it's ready.
That would be so kind of you, Iris. Thank you.
A pleasure.
Thank you.
Morning, Mr. Hilditch.
Morning, Jimmy.
Morning.
Have you means of identification?
Identification?
What's your name?
Felicia. Do you have a driver's license?
I can't drive.
Have you any form of identification?
No, I can't think that I have.
No letter? No documentation of any kind?
Could you step aside?
Are you a resident of the United Kingdom?
No, I'm from Ireland.
I'm here to see a friend.
May I look through your bag for a moment?
Every minute I'll be thinking of you.
Every minute you'll be by my side.
The coach to London Victoria, is departing from bay six.
Would the supervisor please call maintenance.
Excuse me. Could you tell me where the lawn mower factory is? Lawn mower factory?
Sorry. Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Excuse me. Could you tell me where the lawn mower factory is?
Lawn mower factory, my dear? No, sorry, can't help you.
Okay, thank you.
No, Lysaght.
Johnny Lysaght.
L-y-s-a-g-h-t.
Hello. Could you give me the phone number for the lawn mower factory in Birmingham?
No.
A place that makes them, doesn't sell them.
By installing food machines, you could dispense with the canteen staff.
The machines back directly on to the kitchens like this.
The prepared portions load straight in.
And at a drop of a coin, the dishes emerge when and how they're required.
What do you mean, "how they're required"?
Piping hot or chilled or anything in between.
Come in.
Here you are, Mr. Hilditch.
Fresh from the oven.
It's better, Iris.
It's better.
Good show.
Thank you, Mr. Hilditch.
I'll let the others know.
It can serve drinks as well.
Just load the machine with tea, coffee, chocolate, softs.
No more than ten minutes labor a day.
You can't lose.
But I would lose, Ted.
I would lose my staff.
I would lose the way Iris takes the bother to bring me up a dish of raspberry jam steamed pudding.
Food must be served by caring hands, not by machines.
It keeps our spirits up. It makes us feel loved!
Can I keep this?
Morning.
Can I help you?
Is this where they make lawn mowers?
I'm afraid not.
Oh. Lawn mowers?
Why?
I have a friend who works in a place that makes them.
The only thing is, I'm not certain where it is. Oh.
You could try the Black Barrow industrial estate.
They've got a garden center there.
They might know.
Go over the bridge, turn right, and go until you see the signs.
Okay?
Good luck.
Hello, sister.
Yes, I know Johnny Lysaght.
And you went out with him?
You hear certain remarks made about that boy, Felicia.
I'm not saying it's gospel.
All I'm saying is there are certain statements made.
What statements?
He joined the British Army.
But Johnny went to England because he couldn't get work here.
There's better boys than that around here, Felicia.
Irish boys belong in Ireland.
Johnny's not in the army.
He works in a factory.
Lawn mower parts.
Would I know your brothers or sisters?
No, just me. Yeah. No?
Just you?
Just you and your father and your mother?
My mother passed away when I was four.
But there's my father and my great-grandmother.
She must be a ripe old age.
Yeah. She's about a hundred now.
That's incredible.
But your mother passed away when you were four?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Sorry, there's no lawn mower parts around here.
Best of luck anyway. I hope you find it.
Okay. Thank you very much.
There's no one with that name on site.
Okay, thank you.
Good luck to you.
You didn't have any luck?
It's not there.
But a man gave me the name of another town.
Yes, I thought of Thompson's casting five minutes after you left.
It's a bit of a distance.
You won't get a bus in that direction tonight.
I'll stay here. Have you got a place?
I'm just going to look for a place.
Marshring. There's a lot of accommodation there. And it's reasonable.
You're after somewhere reasonable? Yeah.
Right. You go straight up the road, take the second right, turn left along the canal and that's Marshring.
I'd give you a lift.
I've just done me shopping.
Thanks.
You looked beautiful the other day.
Has anyone ever said that to you?
No.
I'm saying it now.
You look beautiful now.
Let me give you an important piece of advice... About buying a good loin, or about buying anything, for that matter.
Escoffier, one of the greatest French chefs, says in his important book, Le Guide Escoffier, is a matter of provisions.
No matter what you buy, the cheapest is always the dearest in the end.
So, get your butcher to chop well down between each bone. And trim each chop as for cutlets, but do not separate.
Roll the joints in the form of a crown with the meat inside.
Then attach them together.
Take this needle. It's very scary, I know, but it is so practical.
You tie them together.
It's really fun to do too.
There.
The crown roast of lamb may be filled with ordinary poultry stuffing or filled afterwards with mashed potatoes sprinkled with parsley.
Or, and this is my favorite, with pureed turnip and a pickle.
And what better way to puree your turnip and a pickle than by using your new Gala chef processor.
Let me tell you a few words about your new processor.
It is amazing. There are all these possibilities. To add the right ingredients, you can fold...
This fresh rosemary will be the perfect garnish for our lamb.
Mmm! Let's go inside and see if the roast is ready.
Isn't it perfect?
Last touches.
Now, let's put these lovely little hats.
It makes it very festive, you know?
But also, it's fun with kids around the table.
Sometimes they can pick it up and fight over it, etcetera.
Here we go.
I think we should taste.
Let's have a taste and see how marvelous this is, no question.
Delicieux.
No surprise.
Listen to me, Felicia.
You'll not live in our house and keep company with a member of the British Army.
This family knows where it stands, and always has done.
Think of your great-grandmother.
Her husband, your blood, was executed by the Brits, May, 1960.
Sacrifices have been made, and they will be honored.
We have a duty to remember these things.
Time will not allow us to forget.
This fellow will be back, Felicia.
But associate with him again, and you will leave our house.
You're at the beginning of things, Felicia.
One of these days, there'll be work for you.
Felicia, when you're a child, you take advice.
But I'm not a child, dad. Not anymore.
I've said what I have to say.
You're goin' out, girl?
Morning.
My wife and I were worried about you.
I was afraid you might have left already.
It seems that Thompson's casting would be a waste of time.
But I've tracked down the place you're looking for.
It's about fifty miles away.
A lot of people who live locally make the journey every day.
No reason why your friend wouldn't.
Ada's up there in the hospital.
We had that phone call last night, see, about you.
Ada's poorly.
But what I wanted to tell you is I've got to drive up that way tomorrow morning, on account of Ada.
What I'm saying is, you'd be welcome to a seat in our little jalopy.
I don't think I...
No, naturally you wouldn't.
You probably want to get up there today.
Good luck.
Toodle-oo.
Could I have the lift?
Of course!
It's 6:30 sharp, though, on account of Ada.
But... I like to pop in and catch her before her morning tests.
6:30 is all right.
I'll pick you up outside your BB.
All right?
See you tomorrow.
It won't be long till you're back again?
No, it won't be long.
Can I write to you?
I'm not much of a one for letters.
Come here, look.
Every minute, I'm gonna be thinking about you.
And every minute, you're gonna be by my side, all right?
I haven't got your address.
How are you doing?
Nice to see you.
How are you?
She's nice, isn't she?
Yeah, not a bad bike.
Were you involved the other night?
Me friend Greg, broken nose.
Took some belt.
He did indeed. How are you keeping?
Yeah, I'm good.
Good-lookin' belt. I'm back off to England.
England, for what?
Just back there. Gotta go back to work.
How long have you had this?
Three weeks now.
Don't kill yourself on it.
I won't.
Be careful.
I remember giving you a go on a bike before. Yeah, that's right.
He didn't see we wanted to be alone.
You didn't tell him.
Your address.
I'll send it to you. First thing when I get there.
I'm a friend of Johnny's, Mrs. Lysaght.
I was wondering if you had his address.
What do you want with Johnny?
Just to write him a letter, Mrs. Lysaght.
My son wouldn't want his address given out to all and sundry.
He wouldn't mind you giving me his address.
He didn't give it to you himself then?
No, he said he'd send it.
I was wondering if he sent it to you to give me.
All I want to do is contact him.
You've had enough contact with him.
My wife and I were worried about you.
It seems that Thompson's casting would be a waste of time.
But I've tracked down the place you're looking for.
It's about fifty miles away.
A lot of people who live locally make the journey every day.
No reason why your friend wouldn't.
Ada's up there in the hospital.
We had that phone call last night, see, about you.
Ada's poorly.
But what I wanted to tell you, I've got to drive up that way tomorrow morning on account of Ada.
Mrs. Lysaght.
Mrs. Lysaght?
Mrs. Lysaght, please!
I imagine your eyes as you read these words.
Your eyes are what fill my heart, and give me hope in these confusing days.
Our days together seem a long time ago.
I miss those days.
Are you receiving these letters, Johnny?
Your mother said she would send them on to you.
I need to see you as soon as I can.
You seem like a nice person.
Oh, I'm all right once you get to know me.
Are you married?
It doesn't matter.
I was just asking.
I'm not married, but I have to look after my mother.
Ah. She's getting old now.
Is she?
Are you the only person she's got?
Oh! You are a nice man, then.
You haven't told me anything about you, how you think, how you feel.
I don't even know if you've ever been married or you've got children.
You haven't told me anything like that.
I'm not saying what we had wasn't special, 'cause it was.
I probably wouldn't be here now if it weren't for you, but you know, things are different.
Morning.
Well, here we are.
Was it all right, the BB?
The what?
The bed and breakfast.
Oh, yeah, it's fine.
I'm glad of that. I wouldn't like to think I'd misled you.
Has Lysaght got you pregnant?
We're both responsible.
How long are you gone?
I've missed a few times.
How many?
There's no doubt about it.
Carrying the enemy within you.
Thank God your mother isn't alive to see it.
You're a whore!
You're a whore!
And you're worse than that!
Damn you to hell!
The first time I met up with you I could see you were in a bit of an upset.
You're fond of the boyfriend, are you?
It's not difficult to believe that he's fond of you.
I said it's not difficult to believe that he's fond of you.
I'm having his baby.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're going to be a mother.
We'll see everyone who arrives from here.
Going to get out and look for him? Yeah.
Go on then.
May I help you?
Is this where they make lawn mowers?
We make lots of things here.
Do you know if Johnny Lysaght works here?
I've not heard of that name.
He's about that tall. He's got blond hair.
Let's just check the register.
This fresh rosemary will be the perfect garnish for our lamb.
Mmm! So let's go inside and see if the roast is ready.
Cut!
Oh! Joey was in the shot again.
I know! Go sit there.
Could we do one more?
Yes, of course.
Next time, when you pick the rosemary, could you really roll it in your hand?
No.
He doesn't work here.
He said he loved me.
That we'd be together forever.
Then he left without giving me his address.
I need to find him!
His mother's trying to keep him away from me.
Mothers can be difficult.
I don't want to bother you with it.
Another person's trouble can lift the mind.
Do you understand me?
Don't be ashamed.
I understand exactly how you feel.
Exactly!
I've had experience.
I'll drive you back after I visit the hospital.
I'll just pop in, dear. Find out the state of play.
I'm sorry.
I've got to stand on my own two feet.
Surely you must see that. I was weak before.
You've helped me strengthen everything about my personality, and I feel like I'm ready to go it alone.
I'll always remember the conversations we've had, and the way you've helped me, but... That's it now.
I'm not even a body, I'm not even a person.
I'm just a part of a woman that men want to use.
I've got nowhere to go.
Excuse me. Could you tell me where I might find the lavatory?
Down there on the left.
Thank you.
You're fine. You're not hurting.
You're the strong one.
Why do you need me?
Why do you need my stories?
I needed you. You don't need anybody.
You've got your mum.
You've helped me back to myself, I'm all right now. That's why I wanna go.
I can't get attached to people in my profession.
You should be happier for me. Why aren't you?
You've been wonderful. I can't explain.
And you've helped me get to where I am now.
I've just got this strength and this spirit, and I just want more.
I didn't want interviews.
I didn't want all this crap.
"Who are you? What's your name?
What did you do?
Who's your boyfriend?
How did you get into this situation?"
Hi, my name's Gaye, and I'm a prostitute.
My name's Sharon.
Bobbi.
My name's Beth.
My name's Jakki.
Elsie.
You'll find other people that you can relate to the way you've related to me.
You'll find other people that you can connect with and talk to... That are special to you.
I guess I'm just another ordinary person.
There are lots of people that would find your personality endearing, And they would love to speak to you.
I'd give half my kingdom now. No.
Give me the head of the baptist.
Stop it.
Please don't do that.
It's really scary. I'd like to go back, please.
Where are we now?
Please can I go? Will you just stop the car?
Please will you just stop the car?
I'd like to stop.
Don't just ignore me.
Will you say something?
What? What is... wrong with you?
What's wrong with you? Why don't you just let me go?
I might see...
My God!
Get off me!
Cut!
How was that?
Fine.
Should we do one with Joey?
Sure. We could have him pluck some rosemary, then run to follow you inside.
Is something wrong?
Ada's not so good.
They had to do an emergency at 5:00 this morning.
She's not so good.
I'm sorry.
I'll be all right in a minute.
You get a shock like this, you don't want to be alone.
Both of us with a shock, Felicia.
I'm glad you're going to have a baby, Felicia.
It's a help to me, that.
A help?
Another life coming.
Ada going in at this particular time, and you here.
And Ada concerned about you... When I told her.
"Young Irish girl", I said.
She wanted to know what you looked like.
I told her you were going to be a mother.
I hope you don't mind.
I thought it might give her a lift.
We never had kids of our own.
Yes, you told me.
A great disappointment.
A child is a blessing, Felicia.
Never forget that.
A blessing.
Are you thinking of having the thing terminated, Felicia?
What?
Do they have that over there?
Where?
Ireland.
There's difficulties.
Difficulties.
Of course.
We'll make our way back, shall we?
My father...
My father says Johnny joined the army over here.
It can't be true.
Of course not.
Johnny wouldn't lie to me.
Johnny wouldn't lie to you.
He wouldn't join the army over here.
Come inside. We'll make some inquiries.
The girl I have at the office is very good at tracking things down.
I'm sorry.
I can't be a nuisance at a time like this.
Never a nuisance, Felicia.
Never.
I don't want nothing.
Of course you don't.
Course not, honey.
Today I have brought the Bible to you.
I don't want no Bible!
This is the paradise earth.
This is the promise and the place of the Father Lord.
You hear of the flood? Noah and his ark? You hear of that?
Yes, I have.
Child, we live in a miracle!
Look here at this garden, honey.
The Father Lord is gathering all things in.
I have to get a room for the night.
I can offer you a room.
What I'm doing now is pinching the turkey so that I can loosen...
Who's making inquiries about this soldier?
I'm a friend of the family.
I'm afraid there's been an emergency.
The young man's father's had an accident.
What are you asking me?
Well, the family's uncertain which barracks the lad's stationed at, owing to his father being unconscious in hospital.
We're ringing round all the barracks in the area.
Name and rank?
Lysaght, J.
A squaddie, I would say.
A what?
A private.
We have a Lysaght here.
Oh, wonderful.
We'll pass the message on after fatigues.
Oh, no. It would be better if the family brought the news to him.
Now we know where he is we'll, uh, contact him pronto.
Thank you.
Now, this fine young man will help me demonstrate a novel way of stuffing your turkey without untrussing it and then trussing it back together again.
No, no, no. Too complicated.
I take the stuffing and fit it into a nylon icing bag aith no pipe affixed, of course.
Like this.
Fill it up.
Now, Joey, why don't you show everyone how easy this is.
You just squeeze it until the bird is full.
Oh, Joey! What a mess you made!
Oh, here is a piece of liver that managed to escape.
Open your mouth, Joey.
Open your mouth!
It's very good for you, the liver. Liver is a delicacy.
Go get the towel to help mama clean up.
Oh, what a mess, huh?
Joey.
Johnny!
It's quiet in the gathering house this time of day.
Each and every one is out and about.
Do a lot of people live here?
Black and white, child. Young and old.
All that are called to gather in.
You are not amongst us by chance, for there is nothing that can happen but by the commandment that began in the garden of pleasure.
Adam was taken from out of the ground of the paradise earth, and the commandment was drawn in the dust.
Look close. See the serpent spit.
Where did you find this?
She was quite a sensation back then, wasn't she?
Gave Fannie Craddock a run for her money.
Not that I understood a word she said.
What was the name of her little boy?
Jimmy?
Does it say?
Oh, here it is.
Joey.
What is it, child?
I've lost some money.
Money? It was in my bag.
What you saying to me, child?
I had money with my clothes. It was hidden away in my bag and it's been taken.
Not in this house.
Never that, child.
It's missing.
Stolen!
You're saying stolen.
No, not at all.
Only, I left the bag when I first came in.
We provide you with shelter and true belief, and now there is accusation?
I didn't say it was stolen.
I just want it back. I've no money now.
You're asking for money, child?
No. I'm sorry to wake you.
There's been a terrible confusion.
The child has lost some money.
If one of you might have seen it...
Maybe I took it out by mistake, or it slipped out of the bag.
She says it has been stolen!
Are you working?
I say, are you working?
Give me a special price.
Are you working?
Suit yourself.
Nowhere to settle, dear?
Come.
Keep me company.
We meet again.
No luck with your searchings?
You're soaking wet.
Come in, come in.
Give me your bag.
Look at you.
Go through.
It's warm in there.
Yesterday, you said, could you help me that day. And I was wondering...
I was wondering if you could lend me the fare to go home.
You want to go back?
It was a mistake comin' here.
I shouldn't ever have come over.
What about your friend, though?
I'll never find him.
You can't give up, Felicia.
Not this easily.
If your friend knew all this, he'd be doing his nut with worry.
I've had experience of this.
If he knew what you've been going through, looking for him in a country that's so strange to you, poor fellow would be beside himself.
I want to find Johnny.
And that's what we'll do.
I'll ask the girl at the office to ring round, like I suggested.
You remember I suggested that, Felicia, before you...
I'm so sorry. It's completely understandable, you scuttling off like that.
I passed that incident on to Ada when she had a bright moment.
She said it was understandable.
I only mention it 'cause I wouldn't like you to think there was any offense taken.
Is your wife getting better?
Ada died, dear.
God, I... I'm sorry.
This morning.
I've just got home.
As a matter of fact, we have to say it was a blessed release.
We have to use that expression, Felicia.
You need something to eat.
Come to the kitchen.
There's a place I've heard of where the Irish boys meet up of an evening.
It's called the Barton Arms.
Have you checked out The Barton Arms at all?
It's a pub.
I have high hopes of the Barton Arms.
I've a feeling in my bones.
Tell you the truth, it'd give me a lift to go out.
No go, dear?
No? They aren't even Irish.
Oh. Happen the Irish lads come in later.
We'll give it 20 minutes, eh?
Come on, sit down.
Bear with me a minute, Felicia.
It's just occurred to me,
I know a bloke who employs Irish labor.
He's a manager of a smelting works about a mile off.
I'll give him a ring. I'll get us some drinks as well.
Did you want a cup of tea?
Won't be a minute.
As many flowers as are available.
As long as they can be delivered immediately.
Right. Yes.
Well, I'll leave the selection up to you.
Yes, it's a funeral.
No dice.
Out for the evening, seemingly.
We'll move on, shall we?
We haven't had our drinks yet.
I hope it's not a presumption on my part, Felicia, but, uh, have you considered your condition at all?
It's only I'm thinking, whatever the outcome of tracking Johnny down is, you don't want to let yourself get caught.
"Don't let it go too far", was always Ada's advice. And my own as well.
Enough to say, you've lost it.
I don't want to do a thing like that.
Now, now.
Drink some of that tea while it's warm.
The goodness is in the warmth, they say.
I only mention it because Ada mentioned it before she went.
But you're right. It's best left for now.
I'll get the girl in my office to make her inquiries first thing in the morning.
She won't find him.
If anyone can find your friend, that girl can.
By tomorrow, we'll have Master Johnny in our sights.
I'll come back in a few days.
A few days?
What are you talking about, Felicia?
I forgot about the funeral.
Listen, dear.
Army life taught me something very important.
You carry on.
Chin up, and march forward.
As far as Johnny is concerned, by tomorrow night we'll know the score.
I'll come back tomorrow night, then.
You'll find somewhere tonight, will ya?
I'll manage.
You all right in the toilet department before you set off?
Yes, all right, thanks.
You're welcome, of course, to lay your head down here.
I'll get you a blanket, shall I?
Yes, please.
My favorite thing was to run a bath, you know, like a bubble bath, and have scent. Candles all around.
I'd walk around in her robe while it was running.
And then I'd just sink away.
And then, when I'd finished, if I had time, I'd go into their room and I'd dress up in her clothes.
Pretend that I was needed and wanted, not just for my body but for me.
For who I was and what I could do.
That was my little fantasy.
Morning.
Now, you will stay in the house, won't you, dear?
We don't want the neighbors to get ideas so soon after Ada. Well, you know.
No answering the door, no phone calls.
I'll be back around 6:00.
Bye.
I dreamt that you met Johnny.
That you knew where he was.
With any luck, Felicia, that dream might come true.
Let's see what my girl turns up with, eh?
I'll pray for her.
Your wife.
Thank you, Felicia.
Morning, Mr. Hilditch.
Morning, Jimmy.
Better spot of weather, eh?
Does your heart good, Mr. Hilditch.
What do we have for lunch today?
Rissoles in batter, or pork.
How was the cod yesterday?
Tiptop.
I'm glad to hear it, Jimmy.
Morning, Iris.
Good morning. Mmm.
Smells champion, that pork.
What is it?
Double sausage roll.
Won't you try it?
That's a beautiful tie you're wearing, Mr. Hilditch.
I've not seen you in black.
Did you not like...
Morning.
Morning!
Hello.
I had an abortion six months ago.
I had to get rid of it.
And it had to be quick.
I couldn't think, I couldn't breathe, because every day it was growing inside me, and it was becoming... It was becoming a person, and I just... It made me feel ill.
I didn't want it.
It reminded me of what I did.
What I do.
So I had to go private. I looked in the phone book. I found a clinic.
Nice place.
The Gishford in Sheffield.
The staff were really nice. Friendly. Didn't ask many questions.
Right. Thank you.
Thank you for fitting her in.
Thank you.
Uh, bye.
Johnny's different.
He'd want our baby.
And you came here to ascertain that. To make sure.
Is that right, Felicia?
But you never got an answer.
You have to look at it like that.
If the girl in the office had struck lucky today, then it would've been a different kettle of fish.
I'm not saying it wouldn't. But she didn't. And I'm definitely of one mind with you now.
Johnny'll be over St. Patrick's day, or Easter.
I was thinkin' about that the entire day.
It'll be all right when I'm there, and we're together again.
There's no doubt that Johnny loves you, dear.
Nothing you've said to me contradicts that.
No. The point I'm trying to make to you is the situation, like you and Johnny are in, could all too easily be affected by misfortune.
Ada said that, Felicia.
Ada had a considerable insight into matters of the heart.
The thing is, Felicia, you're over here now.
This isn't Ireland. And we have certain facilities available.
What I'm saying to you is what I'd say to any daughter Ada and myself might have had.
I'm giving you the benefit of long experience.
There isn't a doubt in my mind, Felicia.
I've thought of nothing else since I rested poor Ada in the ground.
There's some would call it murder.
Murder?
We're not in this world to cause pain, dear.
Of course, you have to think of yourself on occasion.
I'm not saying you don't.
But there are other people too, which is something you're daily more aware of as you grow older.
What are you talking about?
No one's denying you've been through it, Felicia. But so has your dad, and your great gran.
Imagine them trying to hold their heads up.
There's that to think about too.
We all have to do terrible things, Felicia.
We have to find the courage sometimes.
You're a young girl.
When you find Johnny again, you can both make the choice to have a child.
But the circumstances have to be right.
A child needs to be surrounded by all the love it can.
The love of the mother. Oh, of course he'll have that. But the love of the father, and the grandfather, and the great-great-grandmother...
Why deprive this baby of that?
I've, um... I've put by a little that I'd gladly donate in order to do the decent thing by your family.
Anything you lend me, I'll send back.
Every penny.
I've no doubt, Felicia.
They can do an immediate at the Gishford.
A what?
It's a clinic.
They can do it at once.
I asked the girl to put a call in to them.
You could be back across the water by monday.
Back a free spirit, Felicia, with the whole thing lifted from you.
It's what's right, Felicia, believe me.
It's what's meant.
Come on, then. Put your coat on.
Yeah. That's it.
Come on, let's get you home.
Thank you.
We're very much obliged.
See she keeps nice and warm.
We've a little journey. I'll tuck her up.
Oh, just a minute.
Doctor said she wasn't sleeping too well.
Thank you.
Come on, dear.
Take it easy.
We'll have you home in a jiffy.
I'll go in the morning.
Yes. Forty-two pounds.
If I could borrow that.
I doubt if that's sufficient, dear.
One little mishap... It's terrible to be short.
You've had experience yourself, of course.
I'll send every penny back.
And every penny it cost today.
Today was my treat, dear.
I was happy about today.
Ada would've liked today.
But you're in no state to travel, of course.
I have to go.
You weren't at all well in the car, dear.
You certainly can't set off on a journey in this condition.
I shouldn't have done it.
What's done is done, dear.
No one ever grew rich on regrets.
What about the bright side, eh?
For as long as you want it, Felicia, there's a welcome at number three.
You have your own little room now.
The sensible thing would be if we took it day by day.
I had dreams.
The whole time it was happening, I had dreams.
I dreamt that I saw him,
Johnny and me walking with our little boy.
A boy, was it?
I often remember being a boy.
Drink up your cocoa, dear.
I'm sorry if I'm fatherly, Felicia.
I can't help being fatherly.
I've grown fond of you.
The first time I saw you, you were there with your bag, woebegone and bedraggled.
You were different from the rest.
What rest?
The others.
Beth.
Elsie.
Sharon.
Gaye.
Bobbi.
Jakki.
Samantha.
All on their own journeys.
Lost girls.
I was the world to them.
In their time of need, they counted on me.
But then they wanted to go.
Just like you.
But none of them ever came into this house.
It was never that.
Then... What was there?
A chat in the car.
I like the chats.
Then...
Sleep.
They were always asleep when it happened, Felicia.
When I laid them to rest.
I couldn't lay you to rest, dear.
Not until you'd taken care of your little one.
I couldn't do that myself, Felicia.
You are My special angel
Sent from up above
My fate Smiled down on me And sent an angel to love
You are my special angel
Right from paradise
I know That you're an angel
Heaven Is in your eyes
Good afternoon, sir.
Thank you for welcoming us.
Today we bring you the word of our Father Lord.
I myself am from Jamaica, and this is Miss Marcia Tibbits.
May I inquire, sir, if you are familiar with the writings of the Bible?
I'm afraid I'm not interested.
If we could just step inside your home, my friend would offer you her own experiences, how she was gathered in.
Ten minutes of your day is not much sacrifice to make.
The Father Lord gives us time eternal.
We live in a miracle, sir.
There is a future for the one who dies.
Look at this garden, sir.
You see the fruits of the trees, and the people of all nations?
Look. No iron bars are needed, sir, for all the animals are at peace with the happy people.
Look at these brightly colored birds as they flit here and there. Imagine their beautiful song, and the children's laughter filling the air.
Look, sir, as the Father Lord is gathering all things in.
Look here, I'm busy.
I've things to do.
An Irish girl mentioned you, sir.
I remember that now as we stand here.
"A good man", the girl said.
A helpmate to her.
"Duke of Wellington Road", she said.
Big and bighearted was maybe the description.
She said you seemed troubled.
Troubled?
I know no Irish people at all.
The girl make a song and dance that she is stolen from.
Nothing better than a common thief.
Soon, the folk will come from all over for our prayer jubilee.
May I ask you, sir, if you have rooms going spare in your house?
Rooms?
What are you talking about?
Sir, the folk come to rejoice.
For the future is written in the writing of certainty.
There will be fruit for all heavy on the trees.
And the green hills stretch to the horizon. And the corn is lifted from the land.
See the foxes, sir, tamed in their holes, and the geese happy in the farmyard barn.
Hear the cries of the children at play, and the voices raised in song for the Father Lord.
That is the promise. That is the future for the one who dies.
None of us can flee the one who dies, for the one who dies awaits us for when we, too, have been cleansed, and are ready for the paradise earth.
There is a solace for the troubled, sir.
What's she doing?
What's she writing down?
This is a private house, you know?
What is written, sir, is the address.
Three, Duke of Wellington. And the number of folk you have room for when the jubilee is at hand.
Sir, with the folk around you, you will soon discover a heartsease.
We understand your troubles, sir.
We have put two and two together.
What two and two?
The Irish girl brought pain to our people, sir, as she has to you.
You helped that girl on her way.
You did not pass by on the other side.
Sir, you are at one with our church.
Sorry, I must get on.
This is not my kind of thing.
The girl was chattering.
It came out like that.
A confidence trickster, it turns out.
She asked me the way.
We would've shown her the way, sir, as we can show you right now!
Parthians and meeds and elamites! Oh, Lord! And the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea.
We hear them. Some from their gardens. Some from the deserts.
We give you thanks.
Get up from the ground.
We offer thanks!
For God's sake, get up!
Put that girl out of your mind, sir. The pain will wash away.
I'm not in pain.
I don't know what you mean by pain.
The healing will commence.
I'm a catering manager.
I have lived in this house all my days.
I'm a respectable man.
Hilditch I am called.
We have come to gather you, Mr. Hilditch, as we come every day to the houses of the other folk.
Mr. Hilditch, we are concerned for you.
Why not kneel down with us, sir?
Why not permit us to ask for guidance?
We mention the girl to you only to compliment you on your charity.
You are not yourself, sir.
I have seen that, and have said it.
I took that girl's money. To keep her by me.
I am the thief.
No.
I am lonely sometimes in my house.
Often. I am lonely.
You talked about me.
To others.
You told them I was troubled.
You said this to complete strangers.
I'm sorry if I upset you.
I didn't mean to upset you.
No one's blaming you, dear.
Things... happen.
Things... take a turn.
We live in a miracle.
That's the promise.
That's the future.
The pain will wash away.
The healing will commence.
What a wonderful world we would live in
With hatred and love reconciled
If we only showed each other
The faith in the heart of a child
What a wonderful world we could make it
What a wonderful place it would be
If we had the faith of a child to act
And the eyes of a child to see
Then trust would replace suspicion
And hope would replace despair
Our tears would turn to laughter
And wishing would turn to prayer
What a wonderful world we would live in
With hatred and love reconciled
If you and I
Had the simple faith
Found in the heart
Of a child
Your grandchild wasn't born, Mrs. Lysaght.
Did you tell Johnny?
Did you give him any of these letters?
Wherever Johnny is, I want him to know I'm all right.
The pain can wash away.
Healing can commence.
Lost within a man who murdered, there was a soul like any other.
Purity itself it surely once had been.
I remember the names of the ones he took away.
Elsie.
Beth.
Sharon.
Jakki.
Gaye.
Bobbi.
Samantha.
I remember these names with every new face I meet.
May we all rest in peace.
Now they say ice cream is really good for your health.
It's no joke!
Rich in calcium!
Hey, come over!
Come over here to the ice Cream Palace.
Come on over.
How are you?
You see this guy right here?
He's really my best friend.
A nice cone will do you some good.
Here you go... for my friends...
It's chocolate, like his.
Go ahead.
Blessed chocolate!
Even if vanilla is the most popular flavor in the world, the fact is, chocolate is still the best.
You see this guy, my best friend here?
He's just like a big bear.
Wait, I want to show you something.
You see?
In this book, it says--
"The bear is a solitary animal,
"adaptable to all sorts of climates, environments and foods.
"ln groups, they share food when quantities are abundant,
"despite their limited social interaction.
"The bear is a formidable adversary with no predatory instincts at all.
"But when surprised or wounded,
"a bear may attack, and becomes very dangerous."
I don't know what he said, but I guess he's gotta go.
Must have some business to take care of.
Bad move.
No, my friend, out of the question!
You never have to pay here, you know that.
Take this.
Do you speak any French?
Because if you did, it would be much easier for me to learn English.
I took a course, but damn it, it was too hard.
Maybe I have no ear for languages.
Check it out, I also tried to learn Spanish-- but that was just impossible for me too.
Shit!
You play chess by any chance?
Take these.
Man, I saw a really cool thing that I gotta show you.
You won't believe your eyes.
I don't know why, but it made me think of you.
Shit.
C'mon, let's go.
C'mon!
You know what?
Now they say that ice cream is really good for you.
Yeah, I heard it this morning on the radio.
Some nutritionist guy says it's exactly like food.
I don't usually go up on the roof.
I never go up there, but I went up there the other day for the very first time. Just to see the light of the dawn, the color of the sky. And then, I discovered this thing so incredible that I said to myself, you gotta see this.
Check this out, man.
I love this.
Check this out.
It's completely crazy, right?
What a beautiful thing.
But, how in the hell is he ever gonna get it down from there?
That's completely crazy, this guy's a genius!
How's it going?
What a beautiful boat!
When you're finished, will you just sail away into the clouds?
I guess you got some business to take care of, 'cause soon the sun's gonna be coming down.
New findings show that ice cream is actually good for your health.
I'm not joking!
I heard it on the radio!
Come to the ice Cream Palace.
Rich in calcium!
Hey, my friend.
I haven't seen you around for a while.
That little girl was here.
She was looking for you.
You know, Pearline.
She's so funny, walking around everywhere with that little lunch box.
She reminds me of you with your briefcase.
She had a book to give you, or to return, I didn't understand. But she wouldn't leave it here.
What a cool suit!
For me?
Man, that's great.
It's kinda big, but I know some Haitian tailor guys that can take it in, you know?
I'm worried, man.
Earlier there was a strange guy here.
A strange white guy.
I don't know if he was here to deport me or what?
In any case, I got a bad feeling.
He had his arm in a sling.
And more bad news--
Now on the radio they say that ice cream isn't good for you after all.
Too much sugar. Not enough calcium.
What?
Oh, that?
It's for my security, you know?
To protect my business.
Don't I live in America now?
Here.
Yeah, the guy with his arm in a sling? What?
Hey, how is little Pearline today?
A double for you, on the house.
It's him.
Don't shoot him!
His gun isn't even loaded!
It's not fair-- his gun isn't even loaded!
Tell me...
Tell me!
Tell me about Jenny.
- Edward Roel?
- Eduardo Roel.
- You're home, then.
My name's Wilson.
You wrote me about my daughter.
Oh, uh... yeah, come in.
- Who done it, then?
- Snuffed her?
- What are you talkin' about?
I sent you the newspaper clipping, OK.
I tell you what I know.
I never said anyone was snuffed.
There was an investigation, OK?
The car was stolen.
Jenny was... Her neck was broken, on impact.
She wouldn't have felt the effects of the fire.
Those streets up them hills, you gotta' be careful.
Gotta keep your eyes on the ball.
Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind's agitated. You're driving too fast.
Those curves don't kid around.
Could've happened to anybody.
I didn't know her to be reckless but she'd have a drink and smoke pot and that was it.
No, not my girl.
Self-control, she had.
It was a point of pride.
Where did she get it? This grass or whatever. Oh, no.
Look, I am no drug dealer.
What do you think?
You didn't get that ink doing National Service.
I already told you. Corcoran, you know.
You know what that is?
State prison.
I did my time.
My sister's man is in Chino, doin' eight years.
I go to work.
I put my life together.
Put all that shit behind me.
Five years in the joint!
That's it!
I just got out meself, didn't I?
This bloke she was bunked up with,
- Terry Whatsit...
- Terry Valentine.
What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno.
What he gonna say? They had a fight, she drove away. She was upset.
Couple of weeks before Jenny died, she asked me to drive her downtown.
She said she wanted to talk to her boyfriend, Valentine.
I think she was looking for him.
To catch him with another bird?
Exactly, that's what I thought, but we didn't go to no hotel.
- We went someplace else. - Whereabouts?
Some bad place, bad people.
Some guy unloading trucks.
Some kind of deal going down.
I dunno and I don't care, OK?
Could've been shipping fava beans to Eskimos.'
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't there, so... if he was involved, or she was, who knows?
But I wanna tell you...
Jenny stood right in front of those guys, eyeballing them, checking them out.
It felt like she was covering MY ass.
I can't believe that.
Really?
What'd she say?
Hang on.
Can I help you?
You can't be too careful nowadays.
- Lot of tea leaves about.
Tea leaves. Thieves.
Terry Valentine. D'you know him?
And... who are you?
- Wilson.
My name's Wilson.
- Well, Wilson, to start...
- I never heard of you.
- I'm not that well known.
Except in except some districts, some police nicks.
- Police what?
- Me? No.
Can't be bothered.
Who the fuck are you?
How did you get in here?
Only a little bird told me that you and Terry Valentine have business dealings...
I don't know anybody named Terry Valentine.
- Don't you?
- Now, take a walk, pal.
You're making a big mistake.
What you been up to, pal?
What you been doing?
You got to buck your ideas up.
What you been doing?
Jennifer Wilson.
- That name mean anything?
Hold on.
What the hell... Who is this guy?
The only reason you're not dead is I want to find out who the fuck you are.
Jennifer Wilson was my daughter.
- Wasn't she the chick that showed up down here?
Yeah, talked the same as this cocksucker.
Terry Valentine is a friend of mine.
I don't talk about my friends with strangers.
But that cunt daughter of yours, she come here, sticking her tits in my face.
Who am I?
How do I know Terry?
What's the nature of our business together?
I admire Terry a lot, but I gotta say, he let himself get royally pussy-whipped by that bitch.
You know what I would like to have done to her?
You know what I would like to have done?
I bet she would've like that.
Too bad she had to take a nosedive off that cliff.
Probably dried her all up.
Got him!
Get him out.
- You want to call an ambulance?
Call Avery.
Go, man!
Just get outta here.
Come back here, Pop, and we'll kill you.
Understand?
This is private property.
We'll shoot you, fuck-o.
Fuckin' old fart coming here. BIG, dangerous gun!
We're quaking'!
We're quaking'!
Hey, you come back and visit and trespass.
We look forward to it, asshole.
You tell him!
You tell him I'm coming.
Tell 'em I'm coming?
"Tell HIM I'm coming."
- Who?
- Nobody knows.
Adhara.
I remember telling your parents, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I used to hate it.
Now I like it.
It could be worse.
They could have called you...
Reticulum, Pleiades.
God, you're beautiful.
Is there anything in this world you want or need?
I want to know why you need that scary man here.
Gordon?
He's been with me for years.
He's not as tough as he looks.
- Then what good is he?
- Heard of loyalty?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
- Oh, am I a "thing"?
- You're certainly not a person.
- I'm not?
- No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe.
God, I'm glad we're having this little chat.
Come here.
Get out of the pool.
Terry.
I don't know what transpired exactly.
- What?
- Our friends downtown.
Someone took them out.
Took them out?
What the fuck does that mean?
It used to mean, it was similar to a gangland slaying. - Maybe it still is.
- Well... well, who?
- Well... - Blacks?
Blacks?
No Terry, it's not their style.
No, from what I gather, it was a lone gunman.
You sound like the 5 o'clock news.
Why tell me this shit?
If you don't know, I didn't want you to hear it and then freak out.
Fuck you, Jim.
I don't freak out any more.
Well, it's probably nothing.
It's what senseless mayhem comes down to, isn't it?
Bad loan, bad judgement, bad faith.
These were bad people, involved with worse people.
Cops got leads.
Great, as long as nobody connects anything to me.
No one'll connect it to you.
That was a one-off deal, like a moving freight train.
Anything else, I would've had you walk away.
- You never saw them again.
- Are you crazy?
They're your friends, not mine.
What?
Your "clients"?
I befriended them when you needed them.
Well, the cops. I mean, you know, I'm...
Are they satisfied with this... gangland shit, or what?
You know the cops don't get satisfied. They get placated.
They're talking to the kid who got away.
The kid who called me.
Well, I called them...
Scared out of his wits.
All he can say is that the shooter is some crazy guy.
Jesus Christ. Yeah, he said he went nuts.
He was yelling and screaming, "Tell him I'm coming."
"Tell 'em I'm coming?"
"Tell HIM I'm coming."
Who?
Nobody knows.
Great. This is sure making the fuck out of my day.
Terry, relax, would you, please.
The goods are long gone.
Money's been turned around. Middlemen are dead.
This is a good thing.
So, don't panic, OK?
No one can link anybody to you.
Jenny did.
Yeah, well, Jenny could.
She'd already got to you.
Terry Valentine... D'you know him?
Valentine came into the restaurant sometimes.
The guy's a money guy.
They were together how long? Five years.
A long time.
There you go.
Jenny must've liked him.
Jenny would say, "Here's my friend Eddie."
He'd shake my hand but wouldn't even see me, you know?
Jenny met him at a beach, got blinded by his smile.
You believe that?
Jenny and I were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles, you know?
She had her life. I had mine.
How'd you two hook up then?
Jenny was in my acting class.
She was 21 when she came to me.
Straight from leaving you.
You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend.
I do double duty as a voice coach.
Not that her accent would've hobbled her progress.
Not with that look.
She didn't write me, did she?
She didn't know what to say.
I figured somebody should say something to someone.
You're Jenny's father.
Why did you come here?
Thought it'd be nice to have a chat with you, that's all.
Why did you come here?
Get a few things sorted out.
Been busy, have you?
How do you mean?
I heard you were...
What is that adorable expression... at Her Majesty's pleasure.
It was the bars, then.
What was it, uh, Wembley Stadium job?
That was it, right?
Pink Floyd concert receipts.
Earning interest in an offshore account.
Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Security like that can't be bought.
Must be more comforting than having a daughter to greet you.
Oi, ain't you gonna let me in?
You can call me again.
Weren't you in a soap on the box?
Three Seasons.
Who told you that?
Eddie?
He's my new china. - Ch...
- China plate, mate.
Me and him.
Quite a character, isn't he? Not to you.
To us squares in the outside world.
He give me your address.
I gave him yours.
She was right in a way.
Her mum died when she was six.
After that she was on her own.
Aunts and uncles and then...
How can you keep her down on the farm after she's seen L.A.?
I got compassionate leave from Parkhurst to see her in hospital.
Cos we was always mates,
Jenny's mum and me.
I like to think they're together now, you know?
Heavenly choir.
That's where you got the word?
That's where Eddie wrote you, in prison?
Oh, no, no. I knew. I knew before Ed.
What time was it supposed to have happened?
Eddie said... two in the morning.
That's eight hours difference between here and London, that would have made it about like... ten o'clock my time.
I was going out in the yard.
I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.
Stretch me legs, breath of fresh air, bit of a read, stretch out the good part of the day.
And I couldn't open the newspaper.
It was like the pages was glued together.
Me hands were that weak.
I thought I was havin' a heart attack.
Course I know I wasn't.
Guy I knew come up.
"Here, Wilson", he said, "You're as white as a sheet."
I said, "Fuck me, I've been in prison half me life."
But he was dead-on.
I'd felt all the blood drain out of me head.
And I knew...
Huh, I knew something must've happened to Jen.
She was... magic.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that about me. She was always so embarrassed.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed?
Not ashamed.
Disappointed.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Some pop music producer, isn't he?
Rock and roll we call it.
Kind of a promoter, I guess.
Whatever that means.
He took the whole '60s Southern California zeitgeist and ran with it.
Packaged and sold it.
Made out like a bandit.
What's the deal, hm?
You and Terry Valentine at 20 paces?
Come on.
Is that it?
- I don't see why not.
- Are you serious?
Have you ever known me not to be?
You fucking guys and your dicks, man.
What do you expect me to do?
Stay at home doing sweet F.A.?
You don't believe it was a car accident?
She fell asleep at the wheel!
Terry is never gonna give you that satisfaction.
He is NOT the type.
- Depends, dunnit?
- On what?
What makes you so certain?
I bloody ask 'im.
Fine, there's the phone.
Want his number?
I've got his number!
Whatever you gotta do, man. Better go do it.
Looks like he's brought in the 'eavy mob.
- You're kidding me?
- Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
They look a right load of wallies.
You should see 'em.
Patrolling up and down there.
Let me see.
Done up like fucking household cavalry.
Those are valets, man.
Valets? What do you mean, valets?
Who does he think he is? The Marquess of fuckin' Tavistock?
Valets, man. They park cars.
They're having a party.
Oi! Trousers, keep it 'andy.
We're not gonna be staying long.
Boy, we're a little early, huh?
Well, first in, first out.
That's me.
Gentlemen, what can I get you?
Babycham. Eduardo...
Do you want it with a twist?
Tomato juice with Tabasco.
I'll have a coke.
You have the same posters.
- That you have at your office.
No, they're different.
- Well, I like the colours.
- We all did.
Hmm, must have been a time, huh?
In golden moment.
Have you ever dreamed about a place... you never really recalled being to before?
A place that maybe only exists in your imagination?
Some place far away, half-remembered when you wake up.
When you were there, though, you knew the language.
You knew your way around.
That was the '60s.
No, it wasn't that, either.
It was just '66 and early '67.
That's all it was.
I'm gonna have a butcher's round the house.
Who you gonna butcher?
Butcher's hook, 'look'.
Our counterfeit CDs are doing well...
Do I know you?
It was meant to be an infinity pool and go off the edge.
No, it's Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place.
No, there's three different ways up the hill.
The best way is to take Loma Vista.
Loma Lin... Loma Linda.
- Well, you know... - Unbelievable.
It's the record business.
What can you say? - It's the 'how-are-you' crowd.
- The 'how-are-you' crowd...
- Well, you know Jim. - Of course.
We know.
Blimey!
If you can afford a house like this you buy one.
What are we standing on?
Trust.
You know, you could see the sea out there if you could see it.
Could yer?
Where are you going?
No, we're not doing this. You produced the first Christopher Cross album?
Come on, come on.
What was he like, huh?
- Just give me a bit, a nugget.
- I just do the contracts. - That's it?
- Yeah, just the contracts.
Bring the motor round.
Bang out front.
Point it downhill.
As I was driving down Melrose, taking a left on Seward, I saw this guy locking a car, so unmarked it was marked.
- There's a guy down there. - Call the police.
No, no.
Can I help you?
Go, go.
Steady on, Fangio.
Man, you steady on!
What the fuck you do?
You didn't cap the guy, did you?
Did you?
That would have been too easy.
- Too easy?
- He's gotta know why.
You think a guy like that ever will?
- Down!
Come on, man!
Wilson.
Should have let ME do the talking.
Cos you're my security consultant?
What's going on?
- What did you say?
- I said an employee flipped.
That he had drug problems, and he refused counselling... which is true...
And he committed suicide.
One of the guests tried to stop him.
Jim, how the fuck do you stop Gordon at 400 pounds?
That was good, that was good.
- He's heavier now, isn't he?
Jenny never told you about her dad.
Oh, what dad, what dad?
He was in prison nine years and was released last month.
Jenny's father was in prison?
For what?
- Armed robbery.
Again.
Yeah, he a career criminal.
On leave of absence. Get it?
Where are you going?
Don't you think I outta find him before they do?
Oh, man. I am screwed.
I'm screwed to the wall!
He never entered the country under his own name.
Give me a fucking break, man, can you?
Well, I would if I came this far to kill someone.
OK, not even one of your guys should handle this.
Do you want me to tell them?
No, I mean...
I told them I didn't know who the guy was.
People come, people go.
How are you gonna find him?
Terry, he's not James Bond, you know?
- This is a pathetic sad sack...
- Tell that to Gordon.
Some country half the size of Wyoming where the cops don't even carry guns?
This is getting too close to me.
You know something? People close to you fall into canyons.
Oh, well now, that's brilliant.
Hey, relax.
I have other resources.
No-one even near to me because I am out of here.
I'm gone.
How are you so lucky, Terry?
I learned how to skate as a little boy.
Well, you know... Half a dozen interventions if a person won't face up to it.
I guess not.
People in this industry are taken down by doing too many many drugs.
Straight rotation, no bullshit, call your shots. - Scratch the eight, you lose.
- That's good.
- Let me break, right?
- Yeah, break 'em up.
- He broke last time.
- What did you say?
I said he broke last time.
Look at him.
He loves to break.
Look, he's all excited.
I don't give a shit if he likes to break, it's my break.
I won the break.
- I won the break!
- What's the fuck is that?
- Are these your quarters there?
- What's he doin'?
- I dunno.
Go and fuck yourself, and take Mr Goodwrench with you.
Blow it out your arse, but my dick's in the way.
Did I cross the line?
Does that mean you forfeit?
- Just wanted to play a game.
Come over here.
How's it going, kid?
Not bad.
- Could you kill someone for me?
Same as last time.
The rest after.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy you'll know.
I just do it.
I don't organise it.
I'll point you there, but you take it to the end zone.
A hit-and-run gunman.
I figure he's not cruisin' the polo lounge.
This is unprofessional, man.
Well, you see a successful man like me has limitations.
I lose touch with the street.
I depend on smart boys like you. You're closer to the nitty gritty...
Fuck you, mister, all right?
This is a lifestyle I embrace.
So you take care of this.
You see, I'm the one with appearances to maintain.
But who gives a shit about you?
