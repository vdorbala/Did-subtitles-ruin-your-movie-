[ Chuckling ] You lucky, lucky people.
Yeah, you. [ Laughs ] Yes, you.
Fuckin' away.
Aren't you?
Fuckin' away.
Like you're late for evolution or something. Hmm? Yeah, yeah.
Everybody's at it except me. The prince of paranoia.
Yeah.
You see, at the moment, I am dealing... with a monumental case of Mr. Floppy.
And it's killing me.
Funny, isn't it?
[ Jip Narrating ] Well, that's me, I'm afraid.
A legend in my own ego. But if you think I'm fucked up, you should check out my friends.
I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend fucking other men.
It's doing my nut in.
Every bloke she looks at I think she fancies.
Even the thought of her having sex with her past boyfriends gets to me.
Whether they turned her on more or whether their dick was bigger.
It makes me feel inadequate, you know what I mean?
[ Jip Narrating ] Koop is the best of best mates.
We're gonna know each other for the rest of our lives.
We're both as fucked up as each other. You know, I love his sincerity.
He's the coolest person I know.
Alright, I'm having a sub-life crisis.
I feel like a character on EastEnders ‒ the come-down version. What the fuck am I doing in this job?
I wanna go to college, but I fucked up the interview.
When they asked me why philosophy interested me, why didn't I say something like,
"Philosophy is about the meaning of life,"' instead of...
"I've been having serious trouble trying to work life out, and I'm now prepared to listen to other people's theories."
[ Jip Narrating ] Now Nina is Koop's girlfriend.
I've seen her around the clubs for years.
A complete hedonist, but totally down to earth. No edge to her at all.
I trust her with my best mate.
Nina's the most together out of all of us.
She's an absolute mistress. Why would I want a man?
They're all emotionally retarded, egotistical pricks who fuck with your head.
They try to control you and make you feel like... the whore of Babylon if you wear a miniskirt.
I'm an independent girl who wears lipstick because she wants to, not because men find it more attractive.
I'm fine being single.
I am! Peachy fucking creamy.
[ Jip Narrating ] This is Lulu. She's a full-on club minx. Major head banger.
We've known each other for years.
Some people find her a bit intimidating. It's purely social camouflage. Recently we became clubbing partners.
See me?
I'm quicker on the draw than Jesse James, my son. Eh, eh?
[ Snickering ]
I'm sending smoke signals Tonto style, you know what I mean? I wouldn't say no to a girlfriend, you know what I mean?
How nice it would be to drink the white wine from the furry cup, you know?
I just can't be arsed with the hassle part of the dating game, do you know what I mean?
I just ‒ Having a relationship just ain't Top of the Pops at the moment, you know?
I'm having sex with music, mate.
And believe me, I can go all night.
[ Jip Narrating ] I met Moff in a warehouse party last summer.
We've been mates ever since. He got moved down here when his dad got promoted to superintendent. Now Moff is the biggest pill monster I know.
I swear on my mother's life,
I'm having the best time being off my pickle... and feeling the music.
[ The song slightly ends (fades out). ]
[ Jip Narrating ] God's having a laugh, man.
He keeps digging up these social fossils from my past, disguising them as paying customers for me to deal with.
Maybe, it's to remind me that memory's overrated.
-[ Girl Giggling ]
It's Karen Benson. I don't believe this.
I failed the physical with her. Oh, please, just go away.
Fuck!
She's coming over. Oh, fuck.
I'm starting to shake. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Be cool, Jip.
Nothing happened, remember?
Come on.
Act like an adult and be false.
Oh, my God.
- All right? - All right.
[ Cash Register Beeping ]
- Why didn't you want sex with me?
I-I did want sex with you. So what was the problem?
I was just terrified of losing my erection.
- He couldn't get it up for the birds! - The birds!
He must be a fucking queer! He couldn't get it up for the birds!
The birds!
I'm not gay or anything, I--
- I was a bit embarrassed.
See ya.
- It was an accident.
- Some fucking accident.
- So you just gonna throw it all away?
You threw it away when you had your little accident with Yvonne. - Fuck Yvonne. - No, fuck you!
You can't just take the piss outta people and then come back and expected to be Terry and fucking June.
Come on.
I'm sorry. [ Sigh ] Write a song, Tyler.
I don't care.
Good luck with your life, 'cause you gonna fucking need it.
This is the third guy who's fucked me over in a row. It's not you, Lu. You're just a fucking arsehole magnet.
[ Jip Narrating ] Lulu didn't enroll for a degree in social masturbation, but she's getting one anyway.
Matt and Luke are post-Goa-modernists.
They live in a canteen armed only with their Golden Virginia and Blue Rizla+.
Yacking endlessly about that psychadelic clichés and how being black is a state of mind, yeah?
Aah, and they just got back from Amsterdam.
Designer-poor and white-boy-dread posse.
Fucking space invaders.
- Downhill. Right, cool.
- So, how was your trip?
- Ah, well. The theory of the 'Dam is, yeah, life's for living.
So just sit down, skin up, be blot.
We chilled out in the red-light district.
- Everyone's blazing away, smoking trees of weed. - Word to the "mummyfucker."
Our last night there, we were sharing a skunk, chillin' with these two massive Rastas.
We just sat there for three hours going up in smoke.
Nodding our heads to the dub reggae that warmed the place.
The base line was so deep, you could feel the vibrations in Jamaica.
- Yo, what's up?
- Hey, nice, nice. - Any new hip-hop, man? - Yeah.
Eh, I got some smoking West-Coast flow just landed.
Raw as botulism, mate. Now, fuck that West Coast shit.
I want some hard-core East Coast flavor beat.
You know what I mean?
Well, why didn't you say so? Fat beats. Armageddon on the streets.
Eh, we had anymore hard core, we'd get arrested, you know what I mean? Yeah, high.
[ Jip Narrating ] Now Koop's on the pulse, but he's a serious vinyl pusher.
Getting the kids hooked, hustling with style.
This... was recorded by a posse of crackheads on death row, right?
So all them little interludes of prison noises and that, they're for real.
[ Music continues ] ...In despair as I'm sittin' in this chair 'bout to die In jail a long time ‒ no lie ‒ can't cry A lot of things are runnin' through my mind ‒ mostly crime My last request be one more chance to say my rhyme...
I'll take that shit, man.
That shit is real.
Can't be missed. Twenty quid. - Twenty quid?
You know like when the price of artists' work goes up when they die, yeah?
Well, the price of hip-hop albums go up when the gangsters get locked down.
Hey, when they get the chair, the price'll go into orbit, mate. - Is it?
- Look, it's going to be banned.
You know what I mean? - Yeah, all right.
Any new jungle in, guy?
I've got the Tarzan and Jane of jungle just swung in on the vine this morning, mate. I'm telling you, this could turn Hare Krishna into a bad boy.
Fucking hell.
[ Exhaling ] Fuck. We spend nine hours a day, five days a week incarcerated in this... wanky, fucking store... having to act like... C3PO... to any twat that wants to condescend to us.
Do you know what I mean? We have to brown-nose the customers, then we get abused by some mini fucking Hitler... who just gives us stick all day.
What the hell do you think you're doing... just standing around and talking?
If you wanna work in this firm, then wake up and get real.
Now, tidy up the T-shirts, stack the jeans and put them in color-coordinated piles. Take this as your final warning!
[ Jip Narrating ] Now I take the corporate cock shafting like the next person... because I need to pay the rent.
But if you ask me, the Antichrist has been with us for a long time... and he means business, big business.
- All right, Nin?
[ Jip Narrating ] Nina's boss is a closet human.
He desperately wants to get into Nina.
He slides around the shop floor fueled by the bad sperm that pours from every orifice.
- You looking after my meat?
- Oh, that was funny.
- Well, I'm a funny guy.
- Yeah, you should have your own series.
- Come on, Nin, loosen up.
I don't bite.
- You sure?
- Only if you want me to.
Fuck this!
Like most weekenders, I know if you wanna play in the party, you have to raise the capital.
But if you're religious about not working, you deal. You deal for your friends.
Now, Moff is not a pusher. He's not violent. He's never been in any scenes from Scarface.
He just soughts people out with party prescriptions. They're happy.
Moff gets a free night. It's not big business.
Next stop, Trixi.
- Trixi.
- Hard day at the office, Trix?
- I've been working my tits off. I see, yeah.
What's cooking, muffled up beau temps, eh?
[ French: weather ? ] Not much, mate.
Laughing at bus line.
- Do you want...
- What is it? - ? Black Zilla?
- Zilla Black, is it?
- How much do you want?
- I'll take the finest-looking ?
henry?
Besides I'm kind only, I'm fucking psychic, mate. But, do you just know why?
A little right there for a mistress.
Fucking a what, that's just a tenner.
Do you think it costs a tenner?
Oh fuck, you surprise me.
Can I interest you a nanny, Billy Wally Wood? You really know a man got moistured, you know that?
Public Enemy ‒ You're Gonna Get Yours ] ...Cruisin' down the boulevard I'm treated like some superstar You know the time so don't look hard Get with it The ultimate homeboy car All you suckers in the other ride Wherever I'm comin' get you my side My 98 is tough to chase If you're on my tail, better watch your face You gonna get yours, suckers to tha side I know you hate my 98 You gonna get yours...
[ Jip Narrating ] I'm supposed to see my mum tomorrow, but I'm droppin' tonight, [ Note: taking ecstasy ] so there's no way I can deal with her on a comedown. In and out, five minutes. Mum!
It's me.
[ Jip Narrating ] I never knew my mum until I was 15.
I was moved down here by the Social when my father was locked up for fraud.
Well, he was more like my friend than a father, taking me out on the circuit bringing me up his way, you know?
In Cardiff, my mother had always worked from home, which I always just accepted when we lived together, but now when I go and see her, it kills me to see how she gets used, man.
It's been routine for her since she was my age, so she's go no hang-ups about it, which is cool. And I know it's not her fault, but I can't handle staying there long.
Especially if she's with a punter.
- Hiya, love. - Hi, Mum. You all right?
I didn't expect to see you today. No, it's a flying visit. Um, listen, I can't make it tomorrow.
I've got to work, so I'll pop in Sunday.
Is that all right? - All right.
I'll cook dinner.
- Cool.
I'm with someone upstairs a minute.
- Five minutes, okay?
- Um, I've gotta move, Mum.
I've gotta go.
Oh, just five minutes, love. I never get to see you anymore.
All right, all right.
Some chocolates in the cupboard.
My mum can work through a lot of men in a day.
Some fall in love with her, send her chocolates. Some get heavy.
I used to hang around just in case things got out of hand.
Any trouble, I'd be there, you know?
But I couldn't do it for long.
I had to leave.
Sometimes I've got to stop myself from running upstairs... and beating the living shit out of the man who's there with my mum, but I never do.
Twenty quid for a blow job, fifty quid to fuck her.
Mind you, she'll do anything you like, as long as you've got the cash.
She's got all the gear, you know, sussies, open-crotch panties, peephole bra.
Fit tits, cracking' arse. And she'll put on a bit of an act.
Well, they call it acting, but she really enjoys it.
Know what I mean? Fuck off!
. Shut the fuck up!
He never got over his last breakdown when Koop's mum left them.
Since then, he's invented his own alternative reality.
His world is split into those on his side and those on the enemy's side... who he identifies with through looks and gestures.
His dad sends and receives messages telepathically through TV and satellite, and he's waiting for a sign that the mission is over and his life can start again.
- Hi, Dad. - Oh, the cavalry.
So, how long do I've got to stay here?
I don't know.
Tell me the truth, Leon.
Look, I don't know.
It's alright.
I know we both can't talk about it.
It would endanger me, right?
It could be worse, you know?
It could be you among talking the fucking nerd kisses.
I would like to propose a toast... to the bird for giving her Mac job the finger... and for successfully gaining unemployment. What a fucking mistress!
Thank you. Thank you.
Already feels great to be part of the two million.
I'm looking forward to sitting on my arse for a bit, having reversed sleeping patterns and getting into some hard-core "Richard and Judy".
[ Photographers Clamoring ] [ Laughing ]
[ Music in the background ] ...Last night a DJ saved my life...
- Check out the booty. - They want you, honey.
- Listen, now. Go, girl.
...'Cause I was sitting there bored to death And in just one breath he said...
You ain't a DJ until you can scratch. [ Hip Hop Music incl. scratching Doctor X ‒ Puffin' tha Herb ]
Puff, puffin' Puff, puffin' Pu-puff, Puff, puffin' tha herb
[ Cheers, Applause ]
No, breaking his cherry tonight. - How old is he?
Seventeen?
- He's gonna do it eventually, so I reckon... he's better off with me than mixing with the wrong crowd, you know?
- Just keep an eye on him though, yeah?
I'm about to be part of the chemical generation.
Doves, playboys, biscuits, barrels, calis, clear caps, China whites, rhubarbs, looney tunes, New Yorkers.
Larging it. The full monty, safe as houses, pair of trousers, what a laugh, let's do another half.
[ Jip Narrating ] Now Lee is Nina's little brother.
None of us know him, but he's gonna take drugs with us anyway. His enthusiasm scares me, man.
He reminds me of myself... when I was at the beginning of my ecstasy honeymoon.
Are your legs open, you filthy little harlot?
- Is that you, Koop?
- Aw, fuck! Shit! Yeah.
Is Nina there, please? Sorry.
- Hello.
- Are your legs open?
[ Rap music starts playing ]
[ Koop rapping ] ...Girl, I'm gonna tie you up and wear the mask With your strap-on cock fuck me up my ass Your sexual powers leave me drained for hours But I've gotta draw the line at golden showers And, girl, you've got the sweetest arsehole It's like a pink, quivering rabbit's nostril Peace.
[ Laughing ] What are you fucking like? Superb.
Thank you, sweetie. Shit. You got your party head on for tonight?
More so than Wurzel Gummidge on a kilo of Charlie Chan.
But Lulu's not coming now.
What?
Why not? She couldn't get a ticket, and she can't be arsed because of that twat.
- Jip's not gonna be a happy shopper.
- Oh, fucking hell.
- If I found one, do you reckon she'd go?
Maybe. If Jip brings her.
Geezer!
What's happening, man?
How's it going? Are you sorted or what? Hey, you're really cool, man.
You're really cool. Eh, I know we've only just met, mate, but I think I love you, man.
Eh, show me love, show me love, show me love!
[ Laughs ] Eh, safe as fuck, you are, aren't you?
I can't fault you, can I, brother?
- It's like them fucking rookies back at Spike Island, man!
Lulu couldn't get a ticket for tonight.
What? Shit, man.
- Do you know anyone that's got a spare one? - Oh, fuck.
Uh, I think, I think Moff did. But I'm not sure.
It was a while ago.
[ Jip Narrating ] I've got to get Lu out tonight, man. I need to cheer her up,you know?
Get her mind off that twat.
When we hit the clubs together, we're like Bonnie and Clyde, man, way out West.
She's the only girl I've ever felt chilled with,you know, because we've never fancied each other.
Nothing could ever happen between us.
I don't have to try and impress her... or worry about embarrassing silences.
I've gotta get her a ticket and put a smile back on her face. [ Phone Ringing ]
- Hello?
- Hello!
Yeah, well, it's been a lucky week for me, you know?
Well, I think that your luck is gonna change, sister, child of the beat, because... if I just reach down here and dip... into my "Uncle Santa Jip will fix it" magic box,
you will find one freshly cut and preserved ticket for tonight's Asylum.
- You got one? - Ah, yes. Ah, yes.
Everyone's going.
Come on, Lu.
Me and you, yeah? Come on, you've got to go.
Lister, Tyler is a prick, right?
He's a prick.
Do not go down with that one goose paw.
You know I'm saying to ya?
Anyway, town's gonna be full of horny men, do you know what I mean?
Fuck it, fuck it!
All your best friends who love you.
They all want you to be there, yeah?
We'll go an absolute fucking ride.
Me and you. Absolute mayhem. Come on.
We'll take the piss.
Absolute chaos. What are you saying? Come on.
Yeah? - All right!
You got me! - I wanna hear you say yes!
- Yes! Yes! - Yes!
Yes! - Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- See you later, babe.
- [ Laughs ] Oh!
He who dares, wins.
He who dares, my son.
Hold on a minute.
Eh, eh, eh, eh!
How's it going, you big Cockney space case?
No, not at all. No.
Who, who? - Lulu. - Oh, sweet as.
Sweet as, mate.
- Cool, cool. - [ Man ] Matthew!
- Oh, for fuck's sake. I'll catch you later, mate.
Don't go changing to try and please me, all right? - Yeah, nice one, "bruv." Yeah.
- Oh, nice one, brother.
I said nice, bruv!
- Nice one, brother!
- I said nice, bruv!
- Fucking nice one, brother!
- Nice one, bruv--
- Brother!
I'm gonna blow steam out of my head like a screaming kettle.
I'm gonna talk codshit to strangers all night.
I'm gonna lose the plot on the dance floor.
The free radicals inside me are freaking, man.
Tonight I'm Jip Travolta.
I'm Peter Popper. I'm going to Never Never Land with my chosen family, man. We're gonna get more spaced out than Neil Armstrong ever did.
Anything could happen tonight, you know? This could be the best night of my life. I've got 73 quid in my back burner.
I'm gonna wax the lot, man.
The Milky Bars are on me! Yeah!
Calling all the crusaders to the dance floor in green-light mode.
- [ Shouts ] - Disco queens, club casualties, come on!
Let's join forces!
Let's hoof it!
Ah!
[ Indistinct Rap Song ]
[ Chuckling ]
I have taken drugs before, and, uh-- - I had a real good time.
[ Laughter] Didn't murder anybody, didn't rob anybody, didn't rape anybody, didn't beat anybody, didn't lose, um, one fucking job.
[ Laughter] - Laughed my ass off... and went about my day.
[ Applause, Cheering ] Sorry.
[ Man ] We are from weekend music live and direct from the world famous studios, of course, of Radio One here, the Essential Selection,
[ Laughing ]
Why don't you come through the door like everyone else? Because I'm not everybody else, fool.
Eh, don't make me, fucking, prove my masculinity to you now, do you know what I mean?
- Oh, I smells a glassin' in the air, boys, is it?
- Glassing is it? Fuck you! - Fuck you!
Fuck you!
[ Shouting, Indistinct ]
[ Together] ...mighty feet old man! - [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] Come on!
So what, you want a mission tonight then, or what?
!
I'm all revved up, I'm all revved up.
- Battyman and Robin. You now what I mean? Let's go, ain't shit.
Steroids, ketamine, laughing gas.
What do you say?
We'll do a fucking armed robbery in boots on the comedown.
- Is it? - Is it.
Come on!
[ Music playing ]
You could be Cardiff's answer to Travis Bickel, on a timer waiting to explode.
Can you fucking believe that? I mean, can you imagine doing that?
See me, I'd have to take a celebrity with me.
Uh, er, uh-- What's his name? Uh-
- British pop throb. You know? Built like a brick shithouse, he is.
Uh, ugly fuck.
Peter Andre. Peter Andre, yeah.
I couldn't just shoot him first, though, mate.
You're having a laugh, isn't you? [ Laughs ] Oh, no.
You know what I mean? I believe it would be quite rude not to torture him first.
Do you know what I mean though, mate, do ya?
Thumbscrews instantly spring to mind. [ Snickering ]
You know, followed by an intense session of electrodes on the testicles.
Yeah, yeah, a fucking, uh, uh, a wire coat hanger down the Jap's eyes. Do you know what I mean? Really fucking hurt the geezer, do you know what I mean?
And it's time to say hello to the, to the horned man... you've been working on Earth for all this time, Pete!
[ Imitates Shotgun ] Fucking hell, mate.
- Right.
- Here, here. Fucking good film, though. mate, ain't it, eh?
[ Jip Narrating ] Friday night's ceremony is always... to hook up in a bar and wind up the weekend.
- The Backstreet Boys. - Uh, 911. - Hanson.
What gets me, right, is that these talentless wankers... have the opportunity to reach an international audience, right, say something profound instead of--
" Oh, baby, I'm all alone on the phone "
" I'm 14 years old with a broken heart "
Fucking cheese on toast bollocks.
Fucking embarrassing, mate, ain't it?
Embarrassing to watch the little fucking hussy fuckers.
[ Jip Narrating ] She's funny, she's cool, she's gorgeous.
I am out of my nuts. I'm telling you, we're in for one fucking night, mate.
Believe me.
I'm telling you. You fucking stick with me.
I'll look after you.
I'll tell you that now,you've never buzzed like you ever buzz with me.
Do you hear me? [ Lee Narrating ] Oh, I thought I was just gonna drop and have a blender.
What's gonna happen to me?
We believe that ecstasy causes serotonin depletion... and may lead to depression in later life.
[ Jip ] Yeah, all right, Doc. Yeah. Fair enough.
But on the flip side, Lee, you'll feel an overwhelming sense of empathy with people.
You'll be able to be intimate with your friends, talk about things that you never felt comfortable enough to say before.
Overheating when dancing on ecstasy... increases heart rate and palpitations... and can cause heatstroke, resulting in death.
Statistically, you're more likely to die... from choking on a cabbage leaf or an argument in a pub... than you are from dropping an "E."
Alcohol kills 30,000 people a year alone in Britain. But that's all right because that's a good taxable drug, nonetheless, isn't it? Your penis will shrivel up, and you won't be able to get an erection.
[ Bell Tolling ] Anyone, who repeatedly takes ecstasy, is punching the wall between consciousness and unconsciousness.
In later life, instead of reaching for the lasers, you could be reaching for the prescriptions.
- Yeah. - Anyway, it's good seeing you again, man.
- Yeah, yeah. Take care. - See you in the club later on, yeah?
If we'd have been more honest with each other, that conversation would have gone a bit more like this.
- Fucking shame we had eye contact when I walked in.
Yeah.
Together we kinda surf the waves of social paranoia, don't we? No uncomfortable silences as yet.
Yeah, well, not as yet, but, you know, our luck's not gonna last forever, is it?
Maybe it's time for your Houdini impression. What do you reckon? Yeah, all right, man.
- Yeah, and you're with friends. - And I'll see you later. - That's the one.
- Let's pretend we didn't see each other next time, yeah? - Absolutely crucifying as always, mate. - Yeah, whatever.
- Uh, look forward to seeing you. - Yeah, like an illness.
- Don't get run over. Die. - Okay.
- Wanker! - Wanker!
Friday night after the club, yeah?
I got a hard-on, so I ring one of them porn lines.
Hello?
Yeah.
My name's...
I'm from, uh-- from West- - West London area.
What color drawers you got on? I'm buzzing my tits off, yeah?
Ul-Ultra-
- I'm an ultrapren-- "Ultrapreneur."
Have you got brown nipples or just like--
What? You wear all-
- What, you wear all black nail polish and that, do ya? Fuck. Next thing I know, the old man's hitting me with,
"Who the hell you been ringing in Taiwan, boy?"
- Who the hell you been calling in Taiwan? - Taiwan?
- That's what he said. - Fucking hell. Listen, 145 fucking quid.
- Fucking hell! - I'm fucking telling you, man.
145 quid. - Believe it. - Fucking hell, Moff.
Fuck! [ Laughing ]
Fair play, mate, fair play.
That is the most expensive wank I've ever heard of.
- Fucking hell.
Listen, listen, right.
What really took the piss was she was more Cockney than me.
Now can you fucking believe that, Jip? Do you know what I mean?
Listen, now the old cunt's giving it--
Yeah, I know you're sorry.
That's nice, Dad. That is so nice. You lie in bed all fucking day.
You haven't had a job for over a year. You don't have a girlfriend. You're throwing your life away, boy!
And chucking me out on the street, that's just what I need at the moment, isn't it?
Don't give me that bollocks about you're gonna throw me out 'cause it ain't even your house. Ain't even my house? Well, it won't be your house in a fucking week.
- No?
- You're 20 years of age, for fuck's sake.
You really don't understand at all, do you, eh?
I haven't got one friend that actually enjoys their job.
Each one counts down the days till Friday.
Dad, I'm not ready to become that miserable. - Matthew!
- Life's hard enough, for fuck's sake.
- I'm still researching. - Everyone's gotta work, Matthew.
Don't you understand?
I'm unemployed full time.
- I ain't got enough hours in the fucking day. - "Hours in the fucking day?"
You ain't even here in the fucking day.
And take this with you and all, you fucking little-- - Yeah?
Bollocks! I mean, how many times have I told you?
Get your own fucking flat.
Get your own flat. You need your own flat, man. Seriously.
You can get it on the Social. Where am I gonna go, for fuck's sake?
Fuck. I don't know.
What the fuck do you care?
As long as it's got a fucking phone line, it's all right, isn't it?
Fuck off, you cunt.
[ Jip Narrating ] I can't fucking relax.
Glad to see I'm not alone.
I really want to lose my inhibitions. You know, be able to talk to strangers.
Break the ice. But I can't be arsed either.
I don't need this stress on my night off.
Britain, chill the fuck out and then show me how to do it.
I think it's time for a new national anthem.
You know? One I can relate to.
[ Jip Narrating ] Yeah, well, maybe not. [ Music playing ]
This is not gonna happen, man.
No way is this gonna happen.
Okay, what's the- - What's the owner of this club called? - Peter.
- No, it's not Peter. It's a Spanish name.
Pablo. Pablo Hassan.
No way, mate. - Pablo Hassan.
- No, mate. Don't even think about it.
- No, sweetheart. You can't.
- No, seriously, right?
If I'm not back here in ten minutes, I'll see you in there, right?
- Ten minutes, it's all right.
- Jip. - Excuse me, mate. - What?
Got an appointment with Mr. Hassan. - Jip, sweetheart, no.
It's not worth it.
- Go on, my son. Go on, my son.
- I'm a bit late, mate. Do you know what I mean?
- Whoa. - Oh, no.
It's not worth it, man.
- Have a bit of faith.
I've got an appointment with your boss. Can I go in, please? - Pablo Hassan.
- Listen to me.
This geezer's never let me down yet.
- I'm telling you now. - He's not gonna get in.
Doesn't fuck about, does he?
[ Jip Narrating ] Jip, what the fuck are you doing, man?
This is Pablo Hassan. A complete schizophrenic cokehead.
If he reckons you're fucking with him, his boys are gonna fucking maim you, man.
Ah, but he likes to think himself as a bit of a businessman, yeah? Yeah.
And I came here to do business.
Tony Trueman. Sorry I'm late.
- I don't know anything about this, man.
- [ Exhales ] Oh, uh-
- My secretary phoned here yesterday afternoon.
She, um-
- She spoke to someone here, arranged a meeting for tonight. 8:00. - It's all news to me, man.
- [ Sighing ] Oh, God. I don't believe this.
Well, basically, what it is-- Mix mag, yeah, have done a survey of Welsh clubs.
The Asylum has been voted the best club atmosphere in the whole of Wales.
- Nice one. - [ Jip Narrating ] He's going for it.
I interview yourself, obviously, resident DJs, uh, some of the clubbers, shoot everything.
- [ Jip Narrating ] Jip, you're overdoing it, man.
- You wanna do it now, yeah? - [ Jip Narrating ] Don't blow it.
- Well-- Well, you see, that's the only problem.
You're not gonna believe this.
Just got down here from London, right?
And I've just found out... my photographer was involved in a fucking car crash on the way here tonight, man.
- [ Jip Narrating ] What am I talking about? - It's nothing serious, it's--
- It just means we can't do it tonight.
- You mean to tell me... you drove all the way down here from London just so you can't give an interview?
[ Jip Narrating ] It's all over, Jip. You fucked it up.
[ Chuckling ] I know. It's--
For fuck's sake.
I'm sorry about this, mate.
Someone's made a big fuck up here.
I wanna talk to my secretary to sort this out.
Cheers. Come on, come on.
Carmel.
Yeah, it's me. Yeah, I'm in Wales.
Listen, what the fuck's going on? I'm with Pablo Hassan now. It's--
I don't wanna hear it. Listen, has Danny Rampling confirmed his set tomorrow night at the ministry?
- Danny who, love?
- He did. Okay.
All right.
Cheers, Carmel. Oh, have you heard any more about Scott's accident? - What accident?
Cheers, mate.
I can't do tomorrow night.
Uh--
- Next Friday night? Is that all right with you?
- Yeah, we'll go for that. Nice one. Sorry about the fuck up tonight, mate.
I promise we'll get it right next time. - All right, Tony.
I'll see you next Friday, mate.
[ Jip Narrating ] He who dares, my son.
He who dares.
Nice one, mate. Nice one.
[ Dance Music ]
- I hope he's alright.
- Keeping my fingers crossed.
- Sure, here he is.
- We're in. Come on!
- Come on. Where is he?
- Can you see him?
- Look here.
- Oh my God!
- You're number one! - Mate. - What did I tell ya?
- What happened?
- Oh man, a heart attack had happened.
A dove, is it?
- What's your name, mate? - Oh, save as fuck, man!
- What?
Your name's "Save as fuck"? - What are you all about, man?
- I--, I asked you what your name was.
- Huh, you're off the parade then only. - Yeah, mate.
Inca Holmes.
Yeah, Felix.
- Oh, man. - Yeah.
Nice on, me.
Give a spirit alive. Save as fuck. Hi, babe.
[ Music ]
Gives the pukka E's to their homies and they knock out to the kids in the club.
Reach for the lasers. Safe as fuck.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
[ Women Shouting ] Hi, Jerry! We came all the way from Cardiff to say hi!
Hi, we're doing a documentary... for television on the British club culture.
Well, we used to, but now we just jack up heroin and float around the club.
You take heroin to come to the club? Yeah, well, we never used to, but then we saw Trainspotting, didn't we?
And that just made us want to do it.
And sometimes if we watch New Jack City before we go out, we smoke a bit of crack too.
We just seem to be so impressionable.
Well, it's the youth of today, you see.
They need older people to show them how to live.
Yeah.
See, we learn from their mistakes because they've done it all before. - Yeah.
Look at Jimi Hendrix. - And Elvis. - And Sting.
- Sting's not dead yet.
- No, but he should be. [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ]
Oh, uh, sorry. Do you have the time?
Um, yeah, it's quarter to 1:00. Oh, shit.
We've gotta go. We're late for our next hit.
- Hi, Mom! - Hi, Mom!
Bye!
Fuckin' piss-trickers.
What the fuck are we doin' here?
It don't go like anyone says.
It's not like it's used to be.
It's gone too wide spread.
It used to attract like open-minded people who--, who were lookin' for something new.
- Oh, yeah.
Now, it's sometimes a cliché, right, to talk to a stranger in a club for something.
This is essentive everyone's common together and doing what the fuck they liked.
- That's it. - And now, look here.
They so much more playing down, I'm so cool. Fuck off!
We have lost the fundamental reason for using the "E" in the first place?
Which is to leave the ego at the door, and feel comfortable enough to communicate with strangers.
Oi, easy, man?
Twat! Ah, do you remember when this was Tom Toms, man?
[ Both Laughing ] - Tom Toms. - Highly, hi!
[ Indistinct Club Chattering ]
[ Club Music Playing ]
- Oklahoma!
I'm sexually paranoid. I'm sexually paranoid.
Well, I kiss girls and all, yeah?
And as soon as I sense that they want sex,
I just make my fucking excuses and I'm out of there, man.
- I know. It's pathetic.
I know it is.
- No, no.
Everything happens for a reason, Jip.
- An example? - Mm-hmm.
All right. Uh--
What had you been doing? Well, I was stoned. Absolutely stoned out me trumpet, man.
- You just do not look like you're enjoying this at all. - I know, I know.
- [ Thinking ] She's more experienced than you. She's gonna see your cock soon.
Say she's disappointed. Stop thinking this shit! Come on.
She's gonna love it. Say if you lose it during sex.
Oh, it's going down.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm fine.
Uh.
Just a bit tired, that's all.
- I've never had that happen to me before.
- She's making it worse, man! It was my fault.
If it wasn't for the way my head was thinking, everything would've been fine.
You know what I mean?
That is bollocks. We're not fucking robots. There's no rules to sex.
I'd better go, okay?
Um, okay.
[ Chuckling ] Oh, no.
Now she's paranoid.
She thinks it's to do with her.
I'll, I'll give you a call, yeah?
All I could think was--
Fuck me.
I'm impotent.
[ Chuckling ] Oh, poor baby.
[ Club Music Playing ]
All our insecurities have evaporated. We're in the clouds now.
We're wide open. We're spacemen orbiting the Earth.
Yeah, the world looks beautiful from here, man.
We're nympholeptics desiring for the unobtainable.
We risk sanity for moments of temporary enlightenment.
So many ideas.
So little memory.
The last thought killed by anticipation of the next.
We embrace an overwhelming feeling of love.
We flow in unison.
We're together. I wish this was real.
We want a universal level of togetherness... where we're comfortable with everyone.
We're in rhythm. Part of a movement.
A movement to escape. We wave good-bye.
Ultimately, we just wanna be happy. Yeah. Yeah.
[ Chuckles ] Hang on.
What, what the fuck was I just talking about? [ Laughing ]
[ Thinking ] You wanna fuck her, don't you?
- No.
- Don't fucking lie to me.
You've been staring at her arse for the last ten minutes.
Yeah, all right.
Fair play, Koop. But fuck me, she's horny as fuck.
I mean, I ain't gonna do nothing, am I? She's your bird, for fuck's sake. Yeah, that's right.
She's my bird. My fucking bird. Do you understand that?
So stop looking at her. Yeah, alright, Koop, mate. Yeah, alright.
There's plenty to choose from. Just not her! Yeah, Koop.
But, I mean, how do I know the next bird ain't gonna have a bloke?
No, no, fuck that, Moff. Fuck it! Because it wouldn't matter to you anyway.
Yeah. Do you know why you know the answer to that, Koop?
Why do I know that, Moff?
Why do I know? Because you're just the same as the rest of us, mate.
- So, babe, was it fucking proper or what?
- I had a shit hot time.
Listen, there's a party happening in Super Ely, all right? - Yeah, I know. I'm going with my mates.
- My mates. - Nice one, Lee. I'll see you in the wheels, all right, man?
True, man. Nice, nice.
- I'll see you in a bit, yeah?
- Yeah. Who the fuck are those dodgy fuckers?
Lee?
Ziggy Marlon's in tha motherfucking house!
Sorted, man.
Workin' the fucking Herb man.
I smoked enough thai, weren't it be?
Not with these pussies, man, I'm telling you.
- Man, don't fucking trip! You're the one who's trippin', mate.
You've got a fucking kiddies lung.
- What you're on about? - Well, I know who's on about, and you're on about.
What you're on about?
- Your mother!
Your mother! Degrees of Motion ‒ Shine On ] ...Shine on (shine on) Let the light of love grow stronger, oooh Shine on (shine on) You're the sun in my heart, a flame in the dark So let the light of love shine on.
[ Music Playing:
- [ Continues Indistinct ]
- Fuckin' hell, mate.
It's like a fucking video game, this.
Fucking lights and shit everywhere.
[ Laughs ]
Whoo! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I know you gonna dig this!
Oh, yeah, baby.
- [ Indistinct Chattering, Shouting ]
Now, I'm gonna take you on a guided tour of the club casualties.
- That's exact what I was gonna say, man.
Sometimes, man, I look in your eyes, and all I see is fucking resentment.
That's pa-ra-no-ia! M-mmm... - So who do you know, bruv?
- Every motherfucker.
St. Mellons Crew, Lanederyn Posse, Talbots Crew, Docks posse.
- On the Docks? - Yeah. Cool gang and crew, they're smokin' ganja on the beach, man.
- What the fuck you doing to me? - What are you talking about? - Talking to that bloke in the club.
Who? You fucking know who.
Right in front of me as well.
You know, it scares me to imagine what you're like when I'm not around.
Yeah, this all sounds a bit familiar really, doesn't it, lovely?
Yeah, well, how about a little bit of consideration, eh?
I don't want you talking like that with other boys.
You're always touching people, aren't you?
But that doesn't mean to say I'm flirting with anyone, for fuck's sake!
I don't know how much more reassurance I can give you.
What do I have to do?
Don't you trust me?
Answer me! Don't you trust me, Koop?
[ Scoffs ]
Yeah, man, Star Wars is definitely about drug culture, man. There's no fucking question.
It has to be, man. You're telling me, And. You're telling me.
I mean, what was Jabba smoking in that big glass pipe? Come on!
What are we, thick? You know what I mean? - It was fucking opium.
You see his tongue, man? And that fucking tail!
Listen, listen, Han Solo, yeah?
He's got a smuggling compartment in the Millennium Falcon, isn't he?
He's only an intergalactic smack dealer, isn't he? Fucking gets up there!
Listen, Yoda, man, as well. He's been coming down for about 500 years.
- He's fucked, the poor bastard. He's used to be, you know, really tall and handsome, but you know, you know--
- What, like Chewbacca? - Yeah.
- [ Trilling ] - [ Howling ] Can't do it. You know what I mean.
- Now he's fucking-- Now he's like two foot high... - Yeah.
- and, and fucking pointed tabs, white hair and hooves.
What about the emperor? The fucking emperor. The king crackhead of the galaxy, yeah?
He's got so much fucking hard cash... from selling crack to space junkies, yeah?
He's only gone and built his own planet, you know what I mean?
- On drug money.
- The fucking Death Star.
- The Death Star!
- And he's sat in there going like,
"Come on, more power! More power!" - It's like, you know, and Yoda's like--
And he's in chilled-out land. - Yeah, be suited and all that.
- Be creative, yeah.
What was I talking about?
- Huh? - What was I talking about?
- What, just now?
- Your dad.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, tell you what, mate.
Thing about my old boy is, is that I love him and that.
He's always been there for me and... always spoke to me on my level and that when I was a kid, yeah, but I'll tell you what.
- I'm really worried about him. - You're worried about him?
- Yeah. - Why, man?
Why?
He thinks I'm two identical twins... pretending to be the same person.
Keeps calling me Leon.
[ Sighs ] Fucking hell.
And I'll tell you what.
Those drugs they're giving him, they're fucking his head up, mate.
Fuck.
- So, what, he thinks you're two people?
- Yeah. - Fuck.
- Yeah. Fair play, man. That's pretty west, isn't it?
Yeah, but you know, sanity, man, how do you define that?
You know, how do you define sanity, you know?
You know, who's to to say that, you know, the people that, you know, supposed to be mad, you know, who's to say that they're, you know, just not tapped into...
- a higher sensory perception or something, you know? - Hmm. Mmm.
Into, you know, a different kind of universe, they're way ahead, you know? - You know?
And we just haven't caught up yet.
- Ah. Listen to this.
The emperor wants to control outer space.
Yoda wants to explore inner space.
That's the fundamental difference between the good and the bad sides... of the Force.
- Shit. Shit.
Fuck! - Fuck's sake, man! - I just don't know where it comes from sometimes.
[ Rapping ] There's not a problem that I can't fix 'cause I can do it in the mix And if your man gives you trouble, just you move out on the double And you don't let it trouble your brain
'Cause away goes trouble down the drain Said away goes trouble down the drain
I want E.T.'s to abduct me from planet Cardiff.
Let's go! - [ Laughing ]
You can't blame them for not coming though.
I mean, they've only gotta fucking check out the 10:00 News... and check out all the murders and diseases and wars.
[ Both Laughing ]
Two orgasms! - Yes! - Yeah!
He's a genius, um, Socrates. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah?
You know, they fucking thought he was mad, you know.
And this guy, you know, he-- he sped up evolution of mankind, you know? He fuckin', you know-- He was a genius, this guy. They thought he was crazy.
But you know, they should let 'em out, man. They should fuckin' put these people in Parliament and that.
Deal with that! - Yeah, man! - You know what I mean?
Are we fuck.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my God, look at your eyes.
Look at yours. You're fucked. You're sl-
- Look at that!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm fucked. - Oh, my God!
Oh, my, no! - You're fucked!
- You're fucked! - You're so fucked! - No, no.
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right. - I'm looking fine.
I feel fine. - Yeah.
- Little bit tired I'm all right. - Yeah, well-- - Morning.
- Nurse! - I need a piss pot.
- I need a piss pot and a pan. - And a-
- And a brush. - And a brush and a doctor. - And some Haagen-Dazs.
- And a ho! - Fuck it! Bring me a ho!
- Bring me all that shit!
- We gonna eat tonight!
- I need a normal doctor 'cause I'm fucked!
- I'm fucked.
Are you my best mate? Yes.
I am your best mate.
If I told you a secret, you won't tell anybody else?
No.
Definitely not.
I can voluntarily... perform a funny fart at any time.
God, that's disgusting.
- Do I want to show you?
- No. But, ...
I think that makes me love you more.
Now we've reached the hour of spliff politics.
It's the time of the night when everyone knows who's got a spliff... and in which direction it's going. See Casey in the hood?
He doesn't know Herbie, the kid skinning up next to him.
But to get a toke, he's got to start up some bullshit conversation, and keep it going until he gets passed the spliff. Smells like soap bar to me. Can't fault a bit of solid.
He's just hoping Casey will run out of steam... so that he can pass the spliff to his mate Felix.
But Casey's determined to keep on going. - I grows my own shit too.
He's using all his best anecdotes, and Herbie now seems quite engaged in the conversation.
- Felix is trying to get acknowledged. - Yeah, man. Fuckin' homegrown.
Yeah, man, that homegrown shit's good, man.
- But it's not working. - Ah, I just remembered, man.
Millsy's coming down next week with some Thai. Go out and hoof it, man. Wow, look at Casey's face.
Now, it looks like it's all been a waste of time and energy.
- Millsy? Millsy from Roath?
- Yeah. - But he counters.
- Oh, I knows Millsy from down Silhouettes.
It's neck and neck here at the last lap. - Hello, my little space kitten. - Fuckin' hell!
An interception!
But that's always the chance you take.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Lulu ] Round and round the garden like a teddy bear. [ Jip Chuckles ] Who's your teddy bear?
- One step, two steps--
I'm not gonna tickle you. I promise.
- Come here. - Where's your hand going?
I'm not gonna tickle you.
I promise.
[ Thinking ] Please kiss me.
[ Thinking ] I don't know whether I'm reading this wrongly because I'm off my tits, but does she want me to kiss her?
I'm gonna have to make the first move.
He's probably more nervous than I am.
I want to, but I'm scared.
If I've got this wrong, it will be so humiliating.
You know, it's like Vader, man, you know.
Bongin' really hard with a chest like that.
And, um, R2D2 when-- when he's--
Remember that when, uh--
You know-- Fuck it.
- You're a waste of time. - [ Dialogue Rewinds ]
There's no rush. Don't be nervous. You're with me, remember?
Okay. I'm sorry. And don't apologize.
Come here. Come here.
[ Jip Narrating ] Well, what goes up must come down.
And down... and down.
Everyone looks ill at the end of the night.
We've all lost the power of speech, desperately avoiding eye contact.
Your new soul mate that you've been talking codshit to for the past five hours... about the story of creation or the fourth Star Wars film... is now a complete stranger.
The only thing you've got in common now is paranoia. It's coming through the walls, man.
The children of ecstasy aren't safe anymore.
We're no longer all together as one, but separate mental patients that yearn to be ejected out of this poisoned atmosphere... to a warm bed and friendly therapists.
Reality's on her way.
All you have to look forward to now is unconsciousness, but you can never sleep. [ Chill-out Music Playing ]
Where the fuck have you been? Reality, it's all- - It's all gone pear-shaped, mate.
I don't trust anybody in this room right now.
And they're my good fuckin' friends. I mean, Reality-- What the fuck is going on?
Wh-What's happening to me, for fuck's sake?
Moff, you've hammered it too much for too long.
Knock the drugs on the head.
[ Karen's Voice ] You're a waste of time.
Come on, stay with her. Stay with her.
[ Woman ] I don't understand why you can't have sex with me.
Shut up!
Come on, come on, Jip.
Don't be afraid. [ Karen's Voice ] I've never had that happen to me before.
Go with her. Move her. Move with her.
[ Lulu Thinking ] Go with him.
[ Thinking ] Oh, look at her.
She's beautiful. - Hello, you.
- She's enjoying it.
[ Techno Music ]
[ Indistinct Reggae Rap ]
Ready Steady, go
- Pow, pow, pow, pow pow, pow - [ Beeping ]
[ Gasps ]
No! No!
No!
Fuck!
No fuckin' way! - [ Giggles ]
What the fuck was I worried about, man? I told you, man, didn't I?
Overthinking of the stupid little things, mate.
[ Laughs ] That's the story of my life, man.
- [ Humming ]
- What?
- You know.
[ Laughs ] What?
- What we were talking about the other day, mate? - I'm not answering that one.
That's disgusting. No, I'm not telling you that.
It's a personal thing between two human beings. - Fuck off! .
- [ Laughing ]
[ Laughs ] Go on with your bad self! . - Bitch!
- Bitch! You dirty bitch!
[ Laughs ]
No, I'm telling you, it has never happened to me like that before. I mean, I've had that, you know, sort of release of pleasure, but nothing like this.
I mean, it just came out of nowhere.
I didn't have to concentrate or anything.
It was just like- - Ah! Ah!
- Oh, it's the most amazing feeling.
Blurry?
I went fuckin' blind for about 10 minutes!
And then he started running his finger all over my skin, and it went all tingly, and I was shaking all over.
- Oh, it was fucking lush!
- So--
[ Pretending Opera ] "How big was his dick?"
Shut up. I can't tell you that.
- This big.
- [ Laughing ]
But it fits like bric-a-brac.
It comes out from the root and then goes off to the side with a little twist.
[ Laughing ]
Another kid dead from taking ecstasy this week.
Don't know what possesses them to take it in the first place.
Some children just don't have the correct upbringing.
No discipline. No morality.
No respect.
I just don't understand the youth of today.
- [ Beeps ] - [ Dialogue Rewinds ] I just don't understand the youth of today. - [ Beeps, Rewinds ]
- I just don't understand the youth of today.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, spot on, mate. Spot on.
- [ Beeps, Rewinds ]
- No discipline, no morality, no respect. - Some children just don't have the correct upbringing.
- [ Beeps, Rewinds ] Some children just don't have the correct upbringing.
- Another kid dead.
- Parents must neglect them.
Perfect life, perfect family, perfect fucking dining table. Well, give yourself a round of applause.
I swear, sometimes we're living on different planets... because there is no fucking way of communicating with you all.
Who the fuck are you people anyway, eh?
Who the fuck are ya?
So, how was your weekend, Louise?
Um, we all went to a club on Friday night, and then we went to Connie's parents' house for a big party.
- How did you get there?
- Jip drove us.
- He hadn't been drinking?
- No, no.
And, uh-- [ Clears Throat ]
How is Jip?
He's really, really well.
Thanks, Auntie Violet.
[ Chuckles ]
Tah-dah!
- Who are they for?
- They're for you because you deserve it.
You shouldn't have.
Yeah, I should. What's for dinner?
- Wait and see.
- [ Laughs ]
[ Classical Music ]
- It's not like we're gonna be doing this forever.
I mean, we'll all get bored of it, eventually.
Hey, when a comedown outweighs the good times, you know the party's over, man.
- I mean, Friday was a classic, yeah. - Friday rocked. - Classic.
I've definitely got to take some time out... to pick up the pieces, man, and that's that.
- That's what I'm saying to ya. Um, the honeymoon's over, Koop, it's over. Uh, it's not fucking worth it.
I- - I'm--
That's it for me. I've had me lot. I mean, you know--
Youse do what you gotta do, but I'm fuckin', that's it. I mean, it's no more drugs for me. That's my lot.
Drinks anyone?
Moff? . - I'll have a pint of vodka, mate.
I'll have a bottle of Prozac. Yeah, nice.
[ Lulu ] I can't believe all this time we've been going off with other people, looking for the right person and just not finding them.
It's weird, isn't it?
I mean, anything could've happened, do you know what I mean? To change the events of last Friday.
And it'd just be normal now.
Don't say that! I mean, you've always been there, but I've just never thought of you that way.
And all of a sudden, these past couple of months,
God, man, I know exactly when this happened as well. - I know exactly when this happened.
- When? Around your house, right?
It was about three weeks ago.
We're lying on your bed, we're hugging, we're coming down.
- Remember? - Oh, yeah!
Coming down! Absolutely.
- Barely. - Yeah, barely.
- Life is full of fucking surprises, man.
I mean, like, a minute ago, I was thinking,
"Fuckin' hell!
And now I'm thinking, "I'm having the best sex I've ever had... with somebody I've loved for years," you know what I mean?
And, darling, it's only going to get better.
- Now kiss me. - Darling,
- I'm going to fuck your brains out.
[ Jip Narrating ] Well, that's almost it from me and my friends.
Back to mundane Monday.
I guess my point is, I think we're all fucked up in our own way, you know?
But we're all doing it together. We're freestyling on the buckled wheel of life, trapped in a world of internal dialogue.
Like Bill Hicks said, "It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it."
[ Music Playing] ... All

- All - We are together.
- Together as one
We are unified, we are together.

Work harder!
Keep on!
Cut!
Wake up!
Even extras are actors.
We're not making a ghost film now.
Though you guys play the roles of pedestrians, but your roles still have life an soul.
Especially we've chance to act with the Kungfu actress Queen Cuckoo Tu... so we should grasp this chance.
Act smartly, OK?
Action!
Cut!
- Who are you?
- I'm an actor.
Aunt Ha!
Yes.
- Who is this guy?
- An extra.
I'm an actor. Are you mistaken?
How can you let him touch my machine?
Sorry, Brother Sunny, I just went to toilet. so I asked him to do the rehearsal.
Find someone who knows how to act, we need one urgently.
- Let me do it. - You?
Show me the expression of "nervous".
There're several kinds of nervous expression.
The one on the face of a husband whose wife is delivering a baby.
The baby is given birth. But the wife is dead.
The baby calls him dad, he's a genius.
His dick is on his head, he's abnormal.
He wins Mark Six...first prize!
His son is dead...
His wife comes back to life.
His wife comes back to life.
No more response, if one is struck too hard emotionally... he will enter a state of mental coma, he'll show no response.
Is there another guy?
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?
I don't know what you were doing.
Was there anything wrong with my expression?
I've said I didn't know what you were doing.
Aunt Ha, none of your extras is smart enough.
All these extras are above standard.
Sunny, is it done?
Everyone is waiting.
OK... Director, it'll soon be done...
- You, go and change your clothes.
- Thanks.
- Stand in this position.
- Got it.
- Lighting.
- Lighting is ready.
- Settings.
- Settings ready.
Actors.
Stand-by.
Sorry, Director. According to the character of my role. I want to play my role with a bit naughtiness...
But contradiction.
Will this be better?
OK, Speed.
Speed.
- Scene 3. Shot 4, take 1.
- Action!
Cut!
What is it?
What's wrong with the guy behind.
He's supposed to be dead.
- What are you doing?
Aunt Ha!
- What is it? Brother Sunny?
What is your extra up to?
How come you are still alive?
As I said I'd play my role with a bit naughtiness.
So subconsciously I don't want to die yet.
You must pretend to be dead.
Actually, I was dying.
If you give me a bit more time, I'll die eventually.
Do you know how many frames of film are there in one second?
24 frames, Sister Cuckoo.
Do you know how long is the shot just then?
I guess it about one minute.
Do you know as you didn't want to die... that you've wasted how many seconds, how many frames and how much money and how much time and effort of everyone here?
Are you fooling around here?
I'm begging you, you'd better find a professional extra for this role.
Get someone smarter and shoot again!
You'd better be smart!
Go home and think about when exactly you want to die.
OK, Brother Sunny.
Aunt Ha, what have I done wrong?
Don't ask me again, I really don't know what you were doing.
- Then I... - Get lost.
You remind me I must go to a meeting of Neighbour Welfare Association.
I'll be right back.
You don't have to come back.
I'm begging you, stop making trouble.
Let the director watch your performance?
Director, what kind of performance?
You are shot to dead, ready.
Action!
Was it OK, Director?
This is it, go and change your clothes.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks...
Where did you learn acting, man?
- I've never learnt it.
- You're a real genius.
You can make it if you work hard.
Why are you still standing here?
Fuck off!
What are you doing here?
Unit manager, I want to get a lunch box only.
It's not yet lunch time.
- As I'm leaving now, so I...
- Then you just go!
Do you know why it's not yet lunch time?
Just because of you, bastard, you didn't want to die!
And now everyone is working and starving. I haven't eaten as well!
Do you want to have lunch?
Share your lunch with that puppy!
Shit, you're a dump of shit. Your life is cheaper than ants.
I ride a Mercedes, you pick your nostril.
You want to have lunch? You better eat shit!
Why did you just come back now?
- You guys have lunch already?
- Shut up, get me a ping pong racket.
OK!
Where's the ping pong ball?
Get me one now.
Quick.
- Right away.
- Hurry.
This is Neighbour Welfare Association.
You mustn't be late, many people are waiting for you.
Hello, Aunt Ha?
Nothing, I want to check the time for tomorrow notice.
You haven't for tomorrow.
What about the day after tomorrow?
Nothing for the day after tomorrow and so on.
Aunt Ha, where are you?
None of your business, what do you want?
I check with you again, is there notice for role without dialogue?
No.
- Any role that can't be seen clearly?
- No.
Any role that can't he seen completely?
I can't see you now.
Don't trouble me.
- Aunt Ha, where are you?
- Go to hell!
Dear fellows.
The play "Thunder Storm" is adapted from a well-known Chinese classic literature.
You guys all know it well.
Tomorrow, I'll be leading actor, you guys want to see it, right?
So, I'll see you guys tomorrow then.
Kelly, is there anything to do after dinner tomorrow?
Taking a dump.
Come and watch Uncle San's play after taking a dump, it'll be fun.
Remember to bring your dad and mom too.
If they don't come, you can cry, spit around.
Do whatever you can until they come, then you'll be a good girl.
I pamper you, Kelly.
Kelly, if I don't see you tomorrow.
You'll result like this doll.
You get that?
Uncle Chi, the play "Thunder Storm" will be on show tomorrow night.
Have you studied the script well?
Yes, don't worry.
I can even compose a song. Old Master sings whenever he sees the maid.
You're beautiful...
Uncle Chi, I'm the one who sing the theme song.
And the role of "Old Master" you play is a Chinese as well.
When the maid sees the Old Master, she will sing...
You're so handsome, you're so smart...
- Thank you much, please to...
- Uncle Chi, please don't...
- I accept you...
- Are you OK?
Think positive, Uncle Chi.
Someone helps me, come on.
Master Hung, morning. My play "Thunder Storm" will soon be showing.
Shall we make another rehearsal?
Do I need to rehearsal? "Thunder Storm" is about righteous, I knew it.
We're triad society member, we only talk about two things.
First, about righteous, second, about money.
I'll talk about righteous first.
"Righteous" is good, but we mustn't ignore the love line of the story.
Because the role you play will finally be struck to death.
Talking about "struck" (chopping), let me tell you...
There are two kinds of "struck" (chopping) in our world.
First, it is "dragging". Second is "stabbing".
Look, this scar was dragged by knife.
While "stabbing" is like this.
This scoundrel is new comer, sorry, he shows no expression.
"Stabbing" is like this.
Be serious, let us know if you feel the pain, OK?
Your acting is lousy.
Brother Sau, teaching him for me.
Talking about "pain"... according to Stanisslavski, master of acting from Russia.
Let try one more time.
Look, it's much better this time.
Isn't it?
He acts much better now.
Let's try one more time.
Right, a little bit more, more, being stabbed.
Maybe I can help you this way.
This is working, tears come out now.
Look clearly, remember this expression, remember this feeling.
Do remember this, get it?
Let's go.
What about own "Thunder Storm" tomorrow.
No rehearsal needed for "Thunder Storm".
We will come for sure, promise is a promise!
I'll bring hundreds of people to watch your play as well.
- It's a deal.
- Just don't worry.
Faster.
Get into position.
Granny, you stepped on someone.
I didn't step on anyone.
You just couldn't feel when you stepped on him, look at his foot.
Yes, he's sweating as well.
Give me some money and I'll send him to the hospital.
I have no money.
Look at him, he's dying.
I only have $100 left.
Give me, that $100.
Let's move!
Granny, you've dropped some money.
Really good luck.
Sir...
- Are you free tomorrow?
- What is it?
"Thunder Storm" is on show at Neighbour Theatre.
"Thunder Storm"?
Miss, what's your name?
Piu, and you?
This is your name, really?
Whatever I told you, just call me Piu, idiot?
You're really a student?
Sure I am, I'm still a virgin, isn't that great?
It's your luck, Uncle.
Let's play 'Chai Fist'?
I don't know how to play it.
You don't know 'Chai Fist'?
Have you been educated?
Fanny, come here.
Your belly is really big! Mind you can't get into the coffin.
'Chai Fist', Bingo!
Come on, relax, have some fun.
Cheer up, why did draw your face?
Your parents are dead or something?
Chai Fist', Bingo!
Triangle, rectangle, four!
Good, I'll drink!
Tonight is College Girls' First Love Evening.
So please mind your words, do behave like a student girl.
If clients complain about you again, then I can't help you anymore.
What College Girl?
Just a damned trick.
If I can be a college girl, I won't be working here.
You believe you did nothing wrong?
Mamasan, the man at Table 7 is really ugly.
I can't stand it and I am not doing business with him.
Do you all want to be selecting on clients?
No...
You're too much.
You are not professional, you can concentrate on one single.
One single spot?
If that man is ugly, you needn't look at him.
If his ears are pretty, just stare at his ears.
If his mouth is ugly but the teeth are nice, just look at his teeth.
So you new comer are really ignorant.
Let me deal with him. Come on, watch what I'll do.
Be smart.
Hi!
You're pretty.
What's your name, Boss?
My name is Pierre.
It's a French name.
Are everyone says I look like a Frenchman, so I get a French name.
If you can't pronounce that well, just call me Pi or Erre.
What's on?
You used to be proud, now you get a lesson.
You can't blame me, he's a real rarity.
Have you seen anyone put a cockroach on his head?
What's the problem?
Look at LuLu, she's playing with that cockroach now.
I admit failure.
OK, from now on, you won't have clients to sit at.
You'll be bored to death.
You're all like this.
Connie, come and teach her for me.
You're not amateur, you should know you must act in front of clients.
But your problem is: you acting stinks.
I can do nothing about it.
I hear someone teaches acting for free.
I'll take you to see him.
Teaches acting?
- Hey, men.
- Yes!
Hurry up, start working.
You again?
Morning, Brother Sunny.
Aunt Ha!
I'm looking for him too.
I haven't given you a notice, what brings you here?
Remember last time that you asked me to think about the ways to die.
I've thought over and I have some new ideas now, and I believe my performance will make you satisfied.
I would have killed you in the past.
Talking about knife, it's different from a gun.
The position of the wound is usually under the armpit, here.
The wound is a bit bigger, and the face will twist more.
If you're betrayed by your own friends, you will even...
I didn't expect...it's you...
Get lost!
Brother Sunny, I...
I just want to act, give me a chance please.
Do you love standing here?
OK, stand here, I won't pay you a dime.
I'll act even if you don't pay me, I only want a lunch box.
But lunch box costs money too, beat it!
Sunny.
What is it, Martial Art Director?
It's bad to use this mannequin to disguise as a dead man.
Figure it out, we're in a hurry!
Yes, OK...got it.
Thank you, Brother Sunny.
Only a lunch box.
No problem, should I put some make up on?
Put it on now.
Director, the actors are ready. Actors are all ready.
Action!
Cockroach...
Let's help sister Cuckoo.
Cockroach!
Go to hell!
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid.
Sister Cuckoo, don't be afraid, it's OK now.
Director, can we cut now?
It's still running?
Cut!
- OK. - Are you OK?
Must you do all these to kill a cockroach!
Let's see if he's alright?
I'm fine, Sister Cuckoo, thanks for your concerns.
Why don't you move at all?
I didn't move since Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.
So I mustn't move.
Do you hear that...
He keeps on acting since the Director hasn't shouted 'cut' yet.
This is what I always tell you: professionalism.
What's your name?
I'm called Wan Tin Sau.
- Yee, give him a cup of coffee.
- Yes.
- Get his phone number for me.
- Yes.
You...work in my team from now on.
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.
- Is this shot OK?
- Yes.
- Sunny.
- Yes.
I am telling you, even extras are important.
The one who played the father, we mustn't use him again.
Got it, Sister Cuckoo.
Sister Cuckoo, I am the one who played the Father.
In fact, it is like this...
Fine...
Let me clean it for you, towel, get the towel.
- Sister Cuckoo!
- Watch out!
Sister Cuckoo, are you alright?
Don't touch.
Don't touch!
Very pretty.
Sister Cuckoo!
Security guard, is there someone here who teaches acting?
I've been in the field of art for ages.
Whether it's movie or TV, I'm experienced.
I was the creative director in Amusement Park Theatre.
So I can sing and dance.
You mean you are the instructor here?
Well, many people here love theatre and play.
They love studying plays with me.
Those people introduce us here indeed.
OK, this way please.
It's you?
Didn't you play in that film...that...
The stupid man standing behind, falls after stepping on a banana peel? You noticed my performance too?
You idiot!
Only an idiot will fall after stepping on a banana peel.
- Why don't you go dying?
- Thanks.
- Are you really that stupid?
- You're flattering me.
You damned extra, you are...
In fact, I am an actor.
That way please.
Damned extra.
What can I do for you?
Frankly, we're hostesses of a night club.
I can tell.
We're holding "College Girls' First Love Evening" right now.
These girls dare to say they don't have the feeling of first love at all.
How can you work like this?
First love was shown at the stage when we where babies.
Say, when a baby sees a comforter, he wants to suck it.
This is a kind of love.
Why did you suck a comforter? You damned extra.
In fact, I am an actor.
Well, so why did you talk about sucking a comforter?
I'm going to explain everything to you.
OK, let's explain it.
First, you must dress up like a college girls, about dialogue, at some vital points... such as:
It'll be more impressive if you have some tears in your eyes.
Just like this.
Do you see?
That teardrop...
Good, the teardrop is inside the eyes.
Where is the teardrop?
You damned extra.
In fact, I am an actor.
You might need something to help you since you've no experience, and the simplest way is to eat Wasabi.
Wasabi? What are you talking about?
Must we be fooled by this damned extra?
Miss, if you must call me an extra, you don't need to add 'damned' in front of it.
In fact, being club girls... If you can show some respect to the others, then...
- What are you calling us?
- Excuse me.
Forget it, we are club girls indeed.
I just don't like him calling me that way.
She's always like this, never mind her.
It's OK...
I've asked you not to stir up trouble!
It's OK...
It's OK...
Why must you still behave like this?
Don't panic, it's alright.
- Don't panic, it's alright. - Club girls?
It's alright... Don't panic, take it easy, it's alright.
How could I know he's so amusing?
I brought you there as I thought he charged for nothing.
If you hadn't block my way, I'd have...
Please, beware what you say to the clients.
- Go out...
- I'm sorry.
What's going on?
This is a big night club.
Get lost, I'm sorry.
- Are there other hostesses?
- Yes, they're coming soon.
Connie, come here.
What is it, Mama Debra?
Master Lung is here and he's drunk.
He thought he's being dumped and he wants his first lover back.
All the girls here are college girls, they'll suit him.
Look, he has scanned almost all my girls.
But none of them suits his taste, he's nuts.
Look at his money, it's piled up.
- Have you gone inside?
- Not yet.
Wait here for a while.
Go and send some more girls here.
I have so much money.
Come and get it if you can.
I want my first lover.
First lover!
You wanna try?
I'll give it a shot, sometimes it's hard to tell the taste of a rich man.
Get lost.
Hurry up, be smart.
Master Lung, here come the beauties.
Say Hi to Master Lung.
Boss.
Get lost!
- Master Lung, don't get mad.
- Go away!
None of them is pretty!
They are not sincere, I want my first lover!
First lover...
They're all here for money!
I am sincere.
I really love you.
Mary, I'll give you anything you want.
I can give you all the money on the table... as long as you don't leave me, Mary.
- What is it?
- Are you alright?
I've hit you hard, sorry.
If that table wasn't there and I could kick you, I wouldn't have been defeated by you.
I'm not here to fight with you, I'm here to learn acting from you.
Go away.
To some honest friends who have the same interest as I do. I'll be more than willing to teach them. Just a second.
I'm coming, 1, 2, 2 and a half, 3.
Must it take you so long for make up?
You damned...
Don't again!
- Your tie is high-classed.
- Thanks.
Since I've taken your money, I should act accordingly.
- Where's the ping pong racket?
- Under the table.
There're many people here, let's go over there.
I'm Wan Tin Sau, and you?
Lau Piu Piu.
What do you want to learn?
How to pamper those bastards in the night club.
The first love feeling of college girls must be built from the base.
You can take me as your client, and greet me first.
Boss, want some fist games?
Don't call me "Boss", you're college girl now.
You can say Good Morning, or Morning, Sir.
Good morning, Sir.
Try to lower your head a little bit, pretend to be shy.
Let your client touches your chin and raise your head and then say.
Morning, Sir.
Your regards are bad, again.
Give me glistened regards.
Morning, Sir.
Too glistened now, I'll faint, again. Take it easy.
Morning, Sir.
These are eyes of dead body, you'll scare others to death.
Again.
Be natural.
Morning, Sir.
Good!
Now let's discuss about your action, say, hugging.
Hug me with your way.
What for?
What for?
You needn't lock others with your thigh every time.
- Sorry, my job requires this. - You must stop doing that.
Being a college girl, you needn't always take initiation.
You can act shyly so that men will hug you.
What do you mean by shy?
Like this.
- Like biting a quail?
- Act on.
Right, when men see you biting a quail, they'll naturally hold and hug you.
Now you can put your head on their shoulders.
What for?
Excuse me, my job requires this.
You must stop doing that!
Superficially it's all.
If we go further, I must then ask you about your first love.
I never have first love.
Everyone has first love.
I said I never have one.
You must have some unforgettable memory. No.
Or you must have heard someone say something you can never forget.
Never!
I hope I can be with you forever.
Promise me, let me take care of you for the rest of your life.
Then you must have unforgettable experience.
Never!
Being club girl?
Didn't say you'll take care of me?
How come I have money if you don't work as club girl?
How can I take care of you if I have no money?
Now, imagine I'm your first boyfriend lover.
Sau, on the night of your play, I was engaged in a transaction.
So I was too busy to come, sorry.
- Was there good response?
- Sure.
It's good then. I will surely come next time.
Someone're shooing kids karaoke, you aren't one of them?
I've things to see you, excuse me.
Take me new boy to collect protection money for me.
Help me improve his appearance...
About the way he speaks?
Right, that's it, you won't refuse my request, right?
Thanks for teaching me.
Over there.
Being a triad member... you must have a unique appearance.
It's right you have a gold chain with you.
You must try to look furious and severe.
Try it.
More furious.
Show some anger.
Wrath.
Throw that nibble away.
This is it, you know what you're going to say?
I seem to know.
Good, I'll remind you from time to time in this dim place.
Tong, over here a bit, right, cheer up.
- Shooting a movie?
- What is it?
I forget already.
You know, HK is in economic recession.
And being hit by financial storm, it's all because of the 'Ross'.
There are many factors.
Now the S.E. Asia collapses in economics... and that infects HK too.
Those enterprises suffer much.
The worse is there'll be global economics recession soon.
You have a view in economics.
I majored Economics in HKU.
Did you?
I graduated this year.
Did you?
I graduated in 1996, this is my name card.
- You're my senior, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- How come you shoot kids karaoke?
- I can't help.
What are you doing now?
Nothing, I fool with triad members.
Seeing you shooting movie here, I come to collect protection money.
Brother Kei, someone collects protection money.
Who collects protection money?
- Economics in HK is now...
- Is it you?
Good.
Bastard, what triad groups are you come from?
Dare you to fool me?
Fix him!
Kill you!
Go to hell!
Bastard...
Dare you play with my bird?
Don't you know me?
Don't come near...
It hurts...
Don't talk with me, pretend we're at a duel.
Make a call...pretend calling for help.
I want to go home.
You must act on until I shout cut.
- You must be profession.
- I want to go home.
It's a day.
They're gone.
Don't be afraid, they're gone, all gone.
Take a chopper and a rush there, get some fame.
What's wrong?
That scoundrel is still there.
Concentrate!
you're scoundrel too, show some anger!
I want to eat ice-cream.
Bastard! Show some anger!
You needn't do that.
Forget it, I fear you now.
What's up? You acted very well.
What has happened?
He acted really well to get this.
He managed to collect $20.
Why are you still crying?
You managed to get $20 protection money in front of a temple.
You're making a fame for yourself.
You do look like a hero.
Keep the image and use it to collect protection money now.
Brother Sau, you're competent, great!
You're flattering me.
Let's get a feast, with this $20.
What are you laughing at?
Keep this image, got it?
- Stop laughing! Cry! - Stop laughing!
Cry!
Be good, cry, cry now!
That under-graduate hold two choppers. And rushes over while crying and shouting.
He's crying loudly.
He is capable to play the spirit of a triad member.
Thanks for his persistence, He managed to get $20 as a protection money.
What are you talking about?
Persistence, Aunt Ha.
I believe that I'm a good actor, do me a favour please.
I have new experience about holding choppers.
I'd play well in a kung fu movie.
What?
You've brought enough trouble to me.
How dare you asking me for help?
Go away!
Sorry, Brother Sunny, he's leaving now.
I've looking for you.
Make up and get ready.
Thanks!
Director, we've found the stunt man.
You said you can't find one just then? You're wasting my time!
I've found one now.
You have no problem?
No problem, I'll try my best to be the stunt man for Sister Cuckoo.
Director, no problem.
Light the fire.
Director. Beside responding with the hot fire, Can I show an expression of cool loneliness?
As you like,
As long as you don't turn your face to the camera, get it?
Got it.
Light the fire, just don't move.
Ready.
Who put the pigeons here?
Director, I put them here intentionally.
There're pigeons here in our last shot.
If the pigeons fly, they'll stir up the fire.
- Take them away.
- Director...
The mood of this shot will be better if the pigeons are there.
How much better?
It's hard to say, it's something abstract.
Anyway, the mood will be better.
Put them up and let's see the effect.
That stunt man mustn't turn his head!
Director, how do you like it?
It's a bit better.
Let's try the effect with the pigeon's head towards me.
Now put the pigeon's tail towards me.
Take it away. Ready.
It's better without the pigeons, take it away.
Ready.
Where's my lighter?
Man, bring me a lighter?
Director, here it is.
- Really?
- Yes.
- It works? - Yes.
Hurry, quick, ready!
Ready, keep your posture, don't move.
Roll, action!
What is it?
What's wrong with you?
You screwed up every time!
Sorry, Brother Sunny, it's very hot here.
I've told you already, and you said no problem.
Shall we try again?
Again?
Get a smarter guy.
It's your fault, Sunny?
Sorry, Director.
Get lost!
I've tried my best to help you, don't ever come again.
Just then...
Do you smell BBQ chicken wing?
I've sacrificed my arm just for this movie.
Unit Manager, give him an over-cooked chicken wing rice lunch box.
OK.
You, don't ever let me see him again...
Or I'll fire you instantly as well!
Aunt Ha...
Don't ask me anymore. Brother Sunny!
Chicken wings rice.
Let me see which is over-cooked, the chicken wing or your arm.
Not over-cooked, go away now.
- Brother Sunny said I have a lunch box. - Go away!
Extras are human being as well.
What?
Repeat it loudly!
Aren't extras human?
Why must you always jump in me?
- You want to know the reason? - I want to know the reason.
Because you're not entitled to eat this lunch box!
You thought you're talented and teach others acting.
You always talk about theory.
You teach someone to be a triad member and collect protection money.
You're indeed insulting the word 'acting'!
Don't shout on, let's get to work.
You talk about 'acting' in front of me?
Shit!
Damn it!
They dare to collect protection money from those 2 ice-cream cars? I'm the protector of those 2 ice-cream cars.
They don't respect me at all.
Men, get some weapons and teach them a lesson.
Sau, come with us.
You can experience how we fight for our right, and keep guard for us as well.
Little Hung, where are you going?
Granny, where are you doing here?
You're getting better with you tuberculosis.
So mind you catch a cold, have you taken your medicine?
Yes, you're going to fight with someone again?
No.
Don't go.
I'm not fighting with anyone.
- Don't go fighting.
Granny, he isn't going to fight, he's going to act in a play.
That Neighbour Theatre, we're playing "Thunder Storm".
"Thunder Storm"?
It's a good play.
Bruce Lee, Bark Yin, Ng Chor Fan did it years ago.
There was great response, so we're putting up one more show.
We're hurrying for the rehearsal.
You're acting in a play? Yes.
Good, my grandson is an actor, how smart he is!
I'm very happy!
OK, come on, go home now.
She's put much saliva on my face.
Your granny brought you up alone, she's a real heroine.
You're not.
See how happy she is.
Stop fighting anymore, come and join our rehearsal.
If you can defeat me, I'll swallow this plate.
You aren't convinced?
You should speak with stressing tone "You aren't convinced?"
This is raise my wrath from the inside.
No need, as no one is watching.
You suddenly want to play "Fist of Fury".
And make us to wear this costume, this way is too much.
I'm doing you a favour, right?
- I only want to change the wig.
- Let's leave.
That girl is pretty, your girlfriend?
Sure.
- Let's get serious, try again! - Coming.
If you can defeat me. I'll swallow this plate.
You aren't convinced?
Change the position, hurry.
We're concentrated when acting on the stage.
It's dangerous if you suddenly rush up.
I want to join you as you guys were fevering up there.
I chose "Fist Of Fury" for some commercial reasons.
Because there're fighting scenes, audience will like it.
The story is consisted of blood and tears.
Speaking of blood and tears, I wonder if my spine is injured.
Last time I was in a bad mood and I slapped at your face. So I came here to apologize.
I'm grateful as you watched our play tonight.
- Thanks.
- You mean it?
Thanks...
Thanks.
Thanks for your encouragement, I'll remember it.
You'll make it!
Last time you taught me pretending to be shy... and men really lift up my chin and I said...
Morning, Sir.
They're all enchanted by me and I'm making lots of money.
Really?
Surely, I've made a fame in the night-club now. Congratulations.
You will become an excellent club girl.
Thanks.
You will become an excellent damned extra too.
Thanks.
Looks, it's so dark out there, I can't see anything.
No, it'll become scenic when dawn comes.
I got to go.
Those 3 guys are dead beat.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
Your lips are chapped, you need lip balm?
Thanks.
I only have this, is it better?
Yes, it's better.
- You want some more?
- No, thanks.
Forget it then.
Go to hell, asshole!
What's wrong with you?
I hate people with chapped lips.
But I don't want to have chapped lips.
Why don't you put some more lip balm then?
OK, I'll put on some more!
Go to hell, don't force yourself to!
I do want to put some more on.
I'm warning you, don't nag when I put it on your lips.
I've said I want to put on some more.
Wait.
You asshole!
Put it on for me like professional beautician, OK?
OK.
- Master Hung.
- What is it?
How much is a night-club hostess charge for overnight?
Around $1000 to $1200 with a fair appearance.
- What if she's pretty?
- How pretty is she then?
I mean she's a real beauty.
About $1 million to $10 million.
Thanks, Boss.
What is it?
- You're leaving?
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Going home.
- And then?
- Going to work.
Is it possible if you don't go to work?
Are you supporting my living if I don't go to work?
What now?
I'll support your living!
Take care of your living first, nuts.
Whether you despite me or not. I'm an actor.
You're talking to me?
You're calling yourself an actor, fuck you!
You owe me 3 lunch boxes, I want to take them back now.
Take them!
Dare you take them!
Thanks.
- Wan Tin Sau!
- Stand there!
Don't run!
Aunt Ha, this is my lunch box.
As you like, someone's looking for you.
Come on.
Mandy, you may go now.
Go inside.
Put down the lunch box.
Close the door!
Sister Cuckoo, director.
Take this seat.
I want you to do an audition now.
We're lovers.
Here is the dialogue before I die.
Take a look.
And my role is...
You play the role of Wan Tin Sau, and I'll play the role of Cuckoo.
OK.
- Call "Action" now.
- Action.
Tin Sau...
Cuckoo...
Tin Sau...
I...
You will be alright, Cuckoo...
I don't think I can make it...
Cuckoo, I've encountered too much failure in my life.
I'm very tired.
If I lose you too.
I can't hold on anymore.
You...take care.
Don't go, Cuckoo...
Cuckoo, answer me...
Speak to me, Cuckoo, speak something, Cuckoo...
Cuckoo...
Cut.
- Sister Cuckoo, clean it first. - Get lost.
What's wrong?
A running nose?
You were really absorbed in the role.
Not only absorbed in it, very stunning too.
Let me tell you, I won't wait for Big Brother.
You can compromise on the schedule with Big Brother. Who will compromise?
I've had it, I want a new partner.
You rather use this guy than Big Brother?
Don't fucking, sorry.
Don't bullshit me, OK?
Cause I'm not doing business like this.
"Oh", don't you bullshit me.
We need some new blood.
New bloods are all around, but we're making a big budgeted movie.
So you can't just introduce a common guy like him to me.
He's not a common guy.
Mr. Shaw, I've noticed him for quite some time. He's a real professional actor.
What professional?
We're talking about business here.
Don't mix your personal feeling into it, Sister Cuckoo.
Let me tell you something man. I'm not going to work with these people and that bitch.
I'm not gonna work with this man,
I don't want to see him, I don't want to talk about it!
Mr. Shaw.
I want you to be the leading actor in my next movie. What do you think?
Good.
Here're the character, background relationship. Scenario, script...
And the novel, you may take them home for reference. I think they'll help you a lot.
Here're the schedules and the character's images.
We'll get your measurement as soon as possible.
Any problem?
I'll surely have a lunch box everyday?
Mama, I don't want to do any business tonight.
What? You fool me again.
I'm not fooling you.
No?
You're fooling me right now.
Master Lung comes to see you, he's willing to pay a lump sum.
You must treat him nicely tonight.
Stop fooling now.
I don't want to work anymore?
You don't want to work?
You think you're a virgin.
Why don't you just quit.
I've fallen in love with someone.
I don't know how to thank you for giving me this chance.
Just try your very best.
I'll input all my strength and time into this movie.
I hope your girlfriend won't complain if you can't accompany her.
I don't have girlfriend.
You'd rather choose love than money?
You're nuts!
I don't care.
You must treat him tonight, whatever you do.
We'll talk about it after that.
Miss, get up and get your handbag.
Master Lung, sorry, I feel sick suddenly.
I'm afraid I can't accompany you tonight, sorry.
Forget it, don't pretend like a virgin.
I have lots of money.
Take it, how's that?
I'm really feeling sick, I can't.
I don't want to hear "I can't".
Is that clear?
Say again.
I really can't.
Is it hurt?
Didn't you say you're a dancing master?
Yes, I can dance very well.
Then what make you step on my feet?
Is it because your pace is a bit too fast?
Can you slow down your beat, just for me?
OK, just for you.
Bitch!
Last time I spent over thousands of dollar on you.
And now I came here and... you turn me down?
You're embarrassing me in front of everybody here.
I'll give you another chance.
Say it again in front of everybody, can you?
I can't.
Master Lung, stop beating her.
She's a little girl.
Master Lung, stop beating her.
Can you?
I can't!
Let's go.
Call someone for help!
- Morning!
- Morning!
- Morning!
- Morning!
- Are you Cuckoo Tu?
- Hello.
It's you?
I'm Lau Piu Piu.
I'm your fans, can I've your autograph, please?
You're very beautiful,
I love watching your movies.
It's Cuckoo, ask for her autograph, she's leaving now.
In today's movie, You play the role of a waiter at a Chinese restaurant?
Or a bell boy a hotel?
What's happened at your face?
Don't bother.
Cuckoo, who are you dating with recently?
You guys are neighbours?
You know him?
Sister Cuckoo helps me, she wants me to be leading actor.
- Go to hell.
- It's true!
Sau, let's go.
Mr. Shaw doesn't like to be kept waiting.
- Really?
- Yes!
I've said you can make it someday, remember?
I've said he'll make it, he will make it.
Cuckoo, ask him if you don't believe me.
Sau, Mr. Shaw is flying to the States this afternoon.
Let's hurry.
I think he wants to talk with you before he departs.
Do you remember, I've said you'll make a fame.
Didn't I say this to you that night on the beach?
I really said that to him on the beach that night.
The producer has reserved the shooting range for you. You must practise shooting.
He'll also teach you somersault, and spring board.
And also fly with wire, you have underwear on?
You must wear underwear when flying with me.
I have.
- OK.
- Let's go.
Is your friend looking for you?
No.
I've something to give you back.
You took it.
Yes, I took it for fun.
For fun?
Is it funny?
No, so I'm giving it back to you.
- Anything else?
- No.
Goodbye.
That's all.
You said you'll support my living, are you serious?
Yes!
You mustn't cheat me.
I've said yes, I'm only waiting for you to say "yes".
Why don't you go aside and chat, just don't be late.
OK.
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Never mind, come there.
Let me introduce. This is Peter, our Producer,
And Johnny, our Associate Producer.
Mr. Wan, morning.
- Morning!
- Morning.
- Sit down. - Please sit down.
I've analysed the character.
I've found there are 3 levels, 4 stages...
And 5 different ways to act it.
I've written it all down, maybe we can discuss it.
Very good.
In order to let foreign audience to accept me as a new actor... I'll have to get an English name, Number.
Number?
Number One?
Yes, Number One.
Good, excellent.
About the image, I also have...
Tin Sau, the leading actor was played by Big Brother.
As he is too busy, we've decided to use a new actor.
Just then he called us up, saying he has time for this movies.
So he'll be the leading actor.
Then...
If so, I can play the role of the scoundrel.
For me, this is also a challenge.
Sorry, we've chosen the actor who plays the role of scoundrel.
Then...
I think...there is...
Mr. Wan, just as Cuckoo has said... we all know you're a professional actor.
Don't worry. We'll get you another role.
Thanks.
What role is it?
You play the role of the lawyer.
Read the script, and remember your lines.
Get prepared.
How many lines are there?
You've three.
What are they?
- The first is: "What".
- What?
- The second is: "Yes".
- Yes...
The third is: "Go away".
I understand.
I'll study them well.
Mr. Wan, mind giving us back the script?
Tin Sau.
- Don't be like this.
- Sorry.
Mr. Wan, please take off the costume.
We have clothes for you to change. This way please.
Tin Sau.
Sorry.
Sister Cuckoo, about the schedule of Big Brother...
Go out first.
It's usual in movie business.
Get out!
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.
My life is cheaper than ants.
You ride a Mercedes, while I pick my nose.
It's worse than dying.
Shit, I'm a dump of shit.
Kid, still want to play a character?
- How may lines?
- Definitely more than 3.
- What kind of role is it?
- A good guy.
What movies is it?
Don't ask so much, are you interested?
-Yes.
- Come here.
What is the situation?
I'm working on it.
Frankly. I'm not a real Unit Manager.
I'm Police Officer, he's my supervisor.
We're from Criminal Intelligency Bureau. Or short-formed as C.I.B.
To make it simple, I'm an undercover.
You're an undercover?
You don't believe that?
I'm much better than those so-called actors.
I'm more skillful.
Because I'm acting every day when I work here.
Though I have no script, I never make any NG. Because any NG will cause the death of me.
So I should be the Best Actor in Oscar.
Mighty!
Today I should be going on a mission with my informant.
But he suffers from epilepsy suddenly, be can't go with me.
I want you to substitute him,
We'll pay you $800 for being our informant.
Money is not important, I only want to practise my acting.
You surely can.
Big Brother, policemen are outside, you'd better run away.
Buddy, just left, I'll stay behind.
You betray me?
Sorry, I'm an undercover.
What make me pull the trigger?
I'll go to the robber's place in an hour.
And I want to install bugs to collect their criminal evidence.
But every time I got there, they'll search me thoroughly.
So, I want you to deliver a lunch box to me, with the bugs inside.
Then you go away.
- You mean I am...
- The delivery boy.
I have no...
Your role is important, grasp the chance.
What about the character, the relation and background?
The character, the relation and background... are all on the menu of the coffee shops.
Study them now.
But you must act accordingly when you are on the scene.
Why choose me?
We need a professional actor.
I think that person is you.
You're the leading actor this time.
What is there in a Mixed Grill?
Pork chop, beef steak, chicken wing, sausage, egg.
And Set Lunch A?
Sunny-side-up-egg, minced beef rice, chicken corn soup.
Coffee or tea.

Let's start.
- It's formal?
- Yes.
- No more rehearsal?
- No.
- Could you say "Action" first
- Action.
- Ben.
- Mao!
Why didn't you ask me to go to Macau with you?
I did page you for that.
When did you page me?
I think you didn't turn the pager on. How come?
I turn it on 24 hours.
No wonder you're so poor.
Hey, check my dick...
This bastard takes advantages of others all the time.
Feel free to check it.
Chu, greet Brother Mao.
Just call me Mao, Brother Chu.
Leather jacket again?
Is it a gathering for leather jacket wears?
We've the same design too.
I'm here to deliver food...
Steamed rice with tomato and egg, $25.5, please.
- Kee.

His jacket is worn out naturally.
Look at the texture.
His jacket must be worn for at least 20 years.
- Your grandpa left it to you?
- I bought it recently.
Bastard.
I want one too.
Order some food now.
Time for meal.
- Come over, help me.
- Time to eat.
Let's chat while eating.
OK, good dishes!
Good dishes?
We can eat something much better after the project. Project?
Wait...no tomato and egg?
I want tomato and egg, I want rice with tomato and egg.
No need, want tomato and egg?
Here it comes.
How come?
It's really tomato and egg, bingo.
Scrambled egg?
No, I want sunny-side-up.
Let me order sunny-side-up with tomato.
Sunny-side-up?
Chu, make one for him now.
Why making trouble? Delivery service is convenient.
You're asking for trouble indeed.
Is it Kuen Fat?
How come the delivery is so fast?
Yeah, I haven't ordered yet.
Why is it taking so long?
I still have something else to deliver, men.
Have you ordered anything?
I ordered it, mutton stew.
How come it is here so quick?
Is it well done?
Ask the cook for that, $39.8 please!
- I'll pay.
- No need.
Why not? Let me pay.
- I've said I'll pay.
- It's alright.
I will pay.
You pay next time, it's my bill.
No...don't do that.
Let me treat you this time!
Just $40 and you two push around and around.
Why don't you pay by credit card, asshole!
What did you say, bastard?
Don't move, either you pay now or I'll take it back.
What are you doing?
I've said many times, why don't you walk closer?
Walk closer and shoot him from the top.
Then blood won't splash on the wall.
You never listen to me. Can't you be a professional?
But delivery boys are very rude these days.
They are always like this.
Let's eat.
Who is it?
I'm here to deliver some food.
Go and take a look, Chu...
How are you, I'm here to delivery some food.
OK.
Steamed rice with tomato and egg, $25.5 please.
You ordered that?
No, I haven't.
You haven't ordered?
Have you come to the wrong place?
- No.7.
- No.7?
It's No.1, send it to No.1.
Do you still want it?
Are you out of your mind, I didn't order it.
Rice with tomato and egg?
What do you mean?
Are you nuts, Go away.
You want rice with tomato and egg, I'll take it.
No, someone else ordered it.
I said I want it, come here.
Come here!
Can you give it to us first?
What a coincidence!
No.1 also ordered rice with tomato and egg.
Is tomato and egg good?
The egg and tomato are both nutritious.
What do you mean nutritious?
It contains a lot of Vitamin C.
Other fruits contain that too.
Other fruits don't contain as much as tomato.

How much if I want 3 extra sausages?
Don't do that.
How much is it?
I'm only a delivery boy.
I ask you how much it is.
I don't know.
How much?
I'm really a delivery boy!
You are not!
Kid, tell us frankly, are you a delivery boy?
- I've just started work today!
- Just started work today?
I didn't know being delivery boy must answer so many questions.
Don't fucking fool me?
What are you doing?
Are you a cop?
Yes, what's wrong?
I'm really a delivery boy.
Nothing...he's an idiot.
Search him if you don't believe. Search him!
Kid, I let you go now, be smart in future!
What is it?
Why did you do this?
What do you want?
What is it?
Want to harm me?
Sorry, I'm an undercover.
Cut.
How's that?
I'm fine, I'm still alive.
I mean my performance.
Very well, as this is your first time being the leading actor.
Good take.
Thanks.
I'll call to police.
- Police!
- Freeze!
He's on my side...
Call the ambulance!
Piu Piu.
What's going on? It's dark already, and you didn't give me a call?
- Shall I cook dinner for you? - Just then I...
What's happen to you? Didn't you play as the leading actor?
I don't care whether you're a leading actor or an extra.
You must support my living forever.
Come on, try it and see if it suits or not.
Red?
Is it lipstick?
You're dating someone else?
I forgive you but...
I won't cook for you if you dare next time, go!
What are you looking at?
Fight back, nuts!
Piu Piu, I love you.
Wait
You two mustn't get married!
Why?
Because you guys are brother and sister.
Sister, I'm sorry.
It's not your business, I'm willing myself.
Your mood is wrong for this situation.
I've told you before. Mood begins from your heart, then goes to the outside of your body... and returns to the heart, got it?
- Yes, got it.
- Don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Sau, I think the role of Master suits you more.
Why don't you play it?
Forget it, I'm not talented in acting.
I'd better be audience.
Not at all.
You're good.
Brother Sau, audience are waiting outside.
- Are they? - Hurry up.
- Take off your clothes first.
- For what?
I'll play it. - Oh, no.
- Give it to me.
But you're not talented.
I'm not?
Are you talented then?
I am.
Give it to me!
- No. - Sau, stop fighting.
Stop fighting, eat potato chips, why fighting for?
There're really many audience.
Sure, as we have special guests today.
Sister Cuckoo comes to help us today.
Thanks, Sister Cuckoo.
You're welcome, we finally have the chance to act on the same stage.
Thanks!
Kung Hei Fat Choi! Thanks!
Happy New Year.
Congraduation! Everybody cheers up.
Thanks! Kung Hei!
%% Why do birds
%% Suddenly appear
%% Every time
%% You are near
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Why do stars
Fall down from the sky
Every time You walk by
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why
All the girls in town
Follow you
All around
Come on. Let's move, let's go!
Got to get to Vegas.
- Holly.
- Hello, bride to be!
- There he is.
- I'm so excited.
Seth, my man.
You can still back out.
Would you stop already?
We're getting married.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Thanks for the update, Larry.
Go.
I need you to come with me.
We're guys.
We don't go in pairs.
We are going to the bathroom.
- I'm not going to the bathroom.
- Come on.
Unbelievable.
Okay, my headset.
They'll kick us out of first class.
- We need to go to the bathroom.
- I'm not going in there.
- Two friends can go to the bathroom.
- No, it's creepy.
- All right, fine.
- Thank you.
- You are starting to bother me!
- Sit down.
Larry, you're my best friend... but if I see Mr. Chocolate, I'll scream.
You're not leaving this bathroom until you call off the wedding.
But I love her.
After everything you've been through?
- It wasn't that bad.
- Not that bad?
Let me break it down to you one more time.
It all started at my wedding rehearsal.
Saturday night, and everything seemed so perfect.
I got my wedding dress.
Then she walked in.
Miss Bachelorette.
Party photos!
Why are you bringing those here?
Give me those, Chelsea!
Who is that?
One of the bridesmaids.
Chelsea Turner.
No boyfriend.
Pretty hot, huh?
She could steam clean carpets, whatever that means.
Say no more.
I'll hook you up.
Wait.
Why would she go out with me?
- I'll lie, fool.
Come on.
- That's my only hope.
- How does she get in parties?
- I don't know.
She always finds a way.
- Excuse me.
- Hi, baby.
Soon to be Mrs. Larry Garnett.
Chelsea, I would like you to meet... one of my groomsmen, Seth Winnick.
He's my writing partner.
He's funny as hell.
He actually reads to the blind and delivers meals on wheels.
I shit you not.
This man is one miracle away from sainthood.
I'm impressed.
Stick around.
Later, I'll part traffic on the freeway.
You know, you guys will be walking down the aisle together.
God, that's great.
- Have you ever done this before?
- Are you kidding me?
I'm like a professional bridesmaid.
I should open a store called Hideous Pastel Chiffon Dress World.
It's my first time, so be gentle.
Nothing to it.
Come here, I'll show you.
I'm an expert at this.
Shoulders back, chin up.
- Act really serious.
- Serious. So much to remember.
You're doing good.
Thanks to my teacher.
Would you mind dropping me off by those guys over there?
You can make it.
I have faith in you.
God bless ya.
In sickness and in health... for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
I now pronounce you Mr. And Mrs. Lawrence Garnett.
You may kiss your wife.
That was so beautiful.
That's my booty right there.
- Come on now.
Robot, baby.
- Here come the robot.
How's your salad?
It's good.
I'm predicting chicken and vegetables show up next.
Right.
Bring it on down!
I heard they're serving dog shit pudding for dessert.
That sounds good.
Thank you.
Yes, I'll be break-dancing later.
I, myself, suffer from white man's disease... which is the number one killer of rhythm.
You are a dickhead.
Amber?
Dickhead.
Cute little pet name she has for me.
- I like it.
- Thank you.
Work it, girl!
Normally, all the bachelors try to catch the garter.
But I'm handing it to the man who needs it the most, Seth Winnick.
Come on up here, buddy.
Come on. Get up there.
Get up there, you sexy thing.
Let's go!
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to get you for this, Jetson!
Now that I'm married, you are next.
I only wish you the joy and bliss... that Holly has brought into my life.
Thank you.
I know she's out there.
Something in my eye.
So tell me everything you know about Seth Winnick.
Girl, Seth is a great guy.
- No ex-wives.
- Beautiful.
- No kids.
- Loving it.
And I know he makes serious bank... because he splits a paycheck with my husband... who now splits his paycheck with me.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, yes.
Hear, hear.
I think he's so sexy.
I wonder if he's got a big cock.
- Hi, Nana.
- Hello, Holly dear.
Remember, you make him wait at least three dates.
- Three?
- Yes, three.
At least three dates.
Don't be a ho, dear.
Nana, give it up.
Shit.
I can't stay long.
Richard thinks I'm in the bathroom.
He'll kick my ass.
Amber's probably slashing my tires.
I have a crazy idea.
Do you want to get together later on tonight?
Yeah.
How would you like to go dancing under the stars?
In Los Angeles?
Wise men say
Be honest.
You bring all your dates here, don't you?
Not all of them.
It depends on if my cousin's working.
Eddie, this is Chelsea.
Do women really fall for this?
You know, I can't honestly remember... being with any other women.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
You are so beautiful.
I know you must hear that all the time... but never at the planetarium, right?
Probably because it's dark.
Aren't I killing?
- It's cute you're trying so hard.
- Yeah?
You can stop trying now.
Falling in love
With you
Like a river flows
You'll have to forgive the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.
God, look at the microbes on that couch.
This place is a freakin' crack house!
This is nice.
You have beautiful taste.
- Really?
Thank you.
- Yeah.
- I'm actually a decorator.
- Really?
You know, I need a decorator.
You have to come to my house.
- Right now.
- Right now?
It's a decorating emergency.
Stay calm.
Let me just change into something a little less matrimonial.
Be right back.
Seems to be a theme running through your reading material.
You mean the bridal magazines?
My mom sends those to me.
For some reason, my biological clock is ticking in her body.
Those moms.
She's threatening to adopt grandkids.
I would love to find someone to share my life with... and start a family.
- How do you feel about kids?
- I can't wait to have kids.
Yeah, tired of mowing my own lawn.
Do you have a cat?
Not a cat.
The cat of all cats.
Gracie, come say hi.
That's okay.
I'm deathly allergic.
I wheeze.
There's my baby girl.
Come here.
Look at her.
She's a cutie.
Any chance we could shave her... and seal her in Saran Wrap?
He doesn't mean that, sweetheart.
So far, it was the perfect first date. So far, it was the perfect first date.
You even got her back to your place.
Just keep in mind that I've only been here three months.
What do you think?
The Sony PlayStation...
That really warms up the room.
Yeah, I thought so too.
That's why I put it there.
Moving on. Please, go into the dining area.
Come on. Stay with the group.
No flash photography, please.
This place could be so warm and cozy.
It's just not.
No, it's not.
A rat hole, really.
Let's go in here.
This is a room I like to refer to as the other room.
Clever.
I'm just guessing that you're an Elvis fan.
Yeah.
He may not be with us, but he lives on through his plates.
Moving on.
And, finally, in keeping with my theme of simplicity... the master bedroom.
- You need me.
- Yes, I do.
You're hired.
- Smart man.
- Yeah.
So just tell me what you want, and I'll make it happen.
Really?
I can think of one thing that I want.
Stop.
I have a rule.
A rule?
Already?
Let me guess.
"Never kiss a client." You're fired.
My rule is I never sleep with a man... unless we've had at least three meals together.
Three?
We had dinner at the rehearsal.
That's one.
And I'm ready for a little breakfast.
Meal number two.
Breakfast at a mini-mart.
I don't deserve this.
That's where you're wrong.
You do deserve this.
This is the best microwave egg burrito in town.
Plus, I needed gas, so it's pretty convenient.
Here you go.
Take two.
They're small.
There you go.
You know, I know what we should do next.
- We are not eating lunch.
- Man.
Tiger, I found your ball.
I guess I used a little too much club.
After 18 holes of professional miniature golf, I'm famished.
You're hungry.
What a surprise.
It's actually lunchtime in Paris.
So that would be meal number three.
All conditions satisfied.
If we do this, it means that I stop dating Richard... and you stop dating Amber or Turquoise... or whatever crayon she was named after.
So you want an exclusive relationship... after six hours?
Or I can just be your decorator.
It's up to you.
You can have the wildest night of sex in your life... or a few nice throw pillows.
Oh, God!
- What'd I do?
- Good morning, Miss Littlejohn.
What in God's good name is going on here?
You know what?
I opened the showroom a little bit early... and this customer wanted to know how well the bed performed.
So this is the new Sealy Posturepedic?
I like it.
After one night, you had yourself a girlfriend.
Chelsea quit her job to work full-time decorating your house.
And she also decorated you.
She even got you to take allergy shots.... so you could build up a tolerance to her cat.
Meanwhile, we were shooting our new sitcom...
Ronnie and Juliet.
Chelsea, this is my agent.
Where do you find these babes?
Hi.
Marty Mark.
With a name like that, I should be modeling underpants.
The man's show is on the fall schedule.
- We haven't shot the pilot yet.
- Irrelevant.
I spoke to Bloomstein, president of the network.
He said it looks terrific.
Bloomstein never says that.
He says, "Looks fantastic."
Which doesn't mean squat.
But he said, "Looks terrific," which is fantastic.
Ronnie, we have to stop.
Why? What?
Was I moving my tongue too fast?
I have this rule.
I can't have sex with a man until we have three meals together.
I said that to Seth.
Get used to it.
Our men write sitcoms.
If they had original thoughts, they'd be novelists.
They don't make any money.
Baby.
That was such a great show... but next time you steal my lines, I want a credit that says...
"Cute dialogue by Chelsea Turner."
It's a done deal.
- Mr. On-The-Schedule!
- Yeah.
I really like this guy.
I think that Seth could be the one.
Are you serious?
Does he feel the same way?
Please, he's a man.
He has no idea how he's feeling.
I know your man Elvis gave Colonel Parker a brand-new Cadillac.
I want a Jaguar with two phones and a fax.
The show was fantastic.
No, it was terrific.
I knew you guys had a hit in you.
I'm glad you saved it for us, instead of wasting it on NBC.
It is so over for those guys.
Girl, it's about time.
I'm so used to you with these... GQ-Iooking, just feel like going bare-chested... bicycle riding through Central Park kind of men.
And they always break my heart.
And they always will.
That is why Seth is perfect.
He's so sweet.
He makes me laugh.
I finally found a nice guy that's ready to settle down.
Lunch tomorrow, okay?
We'll go over strategy.
Now remember, it took me three breakups, seven ultimatums... and God knows how many not-so-thinly-veiled threats... before Larry coughed up this ring.
Okay, whatever it takes. I'm gonna marry that man.
Just the man I want to see.
Rum and Coke, Vodka cranberry.
And it's all on this man.
Coming right up.
Hi, Tawny.
If you ever need an actress that looks like me... don't forget, I look like me.
Yes, you do.
You never know when we might need a sexy neighbor.
Gee, you think I could play sexy?
- I guess I could try.
- Yeah.
Hi, I'm Chelsea, Seth's girlfriend.
I'm Tawny.
Your boyfriend is so cute.
I'll see you later.
Did I hear you say you act?
Why didn't she know you had a girlfriend?
You know, you got me.
Been handing out flyers all over town.
Just do me a favor.
Don't ever give that bimbo a part.
What if the part is for a bimbo?
Then hire another bimbo.
- I just don't like her.
- No?
Chelsea had her fish on the hook. Chelsea had her fish on the hook.
Now she started reeling you in.
Wow.
This place is fantastic.
This looks like an actual house.
You're not Chelsea.
Where are you going, Batman?
- I hope you like dogs.
- I like anything that chases cats.
Hello.
Nice to meet you too.
My God.
He's so cute.
What's his name?
Say, "It ain't Tom Jones, Papa."
Elvis!
- What do you think of the house?
- It's fantastic.
You did a great job.
Reminds me a little bit of your place.
Yeah, I do feel right at home.
You'll love what I did to the guest room.
Surprise.
It's one of those baby rooms.
You said you wanted kids.
I'm good to go.
My God!
This place looks terrific.
Thank you very much.
Man, you are the greatest woman in the world.
- Look at you.
- Sit down, boy.
My God.
That's Viva, Las Vegas.
That's my favorite movie.
Come on, everybody and snap your fingers now
That's it.
Come on, everybody and clap your hands real loud
That's right.
Come on, everybody take it really fast
And repeat after me
I love my baby
And my baby loves me
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the longhaired music
Like Brahms Beethoven and Bach
But I was raised with a guitar in my hand
- And I was born to rock
- Audience participation!
Come on, everybody and turn your head to the left
Come on, everybody and turn your head to the right
The funny thing is I do this every night.
Take a real deep breath and repeat after me
I love my baby
And my baby loves me
Bring it home.
Big finish.
- You know what?
- What?
I love you.
Already?
Wrong response.
It's just that it's only been four weeks.
I knew after four minutes, you dope.
So say it back.
It back.
Seth, you ruined it.
That could have been so romantic.
What happened to Mr. Planetarium?
Shit.
Honey?
Crap.
Where are you going?
Are you leaving?
If you don't love me, it's better I know right now.
But I never said that I didn't love you.
The words every woman dreams of hearing.
It's all right. Maybe I'm just not the girl for you.
- But maybe you are.
- Maybe.
Way to commit.
Wait.
I love you.
- Do you mean it?
- I think I mean it.
If you don't know you mean it, don't say it.
Then I mean it.
Say it again.
I love you.
Again.
Louder.
All right?
Why didn't you just say it in the first place?
I tensed up.
It's a guy thing.
You see what happened?
Every time Chelsea says...
- I love you.
- You are required by law to say...
I love you too.
And that changes everything.
This might be the best idea I've ever had.
Ronnie needs an operation.
Juliet walks in on him.
He's getting a sponge bath from some hot nurse I could help cast...
- The hospital show?
- Come on.
I did not say "hospital show."
- How dare you talk about Chachi.
- I know a lot about Chachi.
People!
We're doing our first 13 episodes.
We cannot steal old plots.
That's right.
Until we get picked up for the rest of the season.
Then we'll just check old TV Guides and phone them in.
It's not "the hospital show." It's the "sponge bath show."
- I need to talk to you.
- What's wrong?
I'm gonna go take a sponge bath.
I'm sorry.
It's an emergency.
Tell him you love sponge baths.
My God, honey, what happened?
Gracie ran away.
Gracie the cat?
Yes.
I'm sorry, honey, but isn't that a cat thing?
They have their little adventures, they come home.
This is not a cat thing."
She has never done this before.
You have to help me look for her.
Honey, I'm under the gun here.
We need a story in like a half hour.
So...
So what are all those writers for?
What is more important, my cat or a stupid sitcom?
Let me see.
There's your cat... that makes me gasp for oxygen... and my body break out in a horrible rash... or my livelihood.
Come on, kitty.
That's not how you call her.
She's used to it a certain way.
Now listen.
No, listen to me!
- You are not paying attention!
- I'm trying, honey.
Are you telling me the cat won't respond unless her name is... properly enunciated?
Don't give me any shit!
This is your fault!
So it's my fault your cat ran away?
Yes.
Every night... poor Gracie watched me pack an overnight bag... with a sad look on her sweet face.
Then I would leave her all alone because of your dumb allergies.
She thought that I didn't love her anymore.
So she left, rather than be a burden.
Maybe we should just respect her wishes.
That is not funny.
I can't stay in my house... without Gracie.
There's too many memories.
So I'm moving in with you.
What, are you serious?
I'm there every night anyway.
If you really loved me, you'd want me there all the time.
- I do.
- Really?
Bang! See how she snuck in?
"If you really love me"?
And four hours later...
Chelsea and Seth can't get to the phone... so leave us a message and we'll call you back.
Won't we, baby?
Sure.
Now, that was smooth.
Chelsea was in the house.
And you know what happened the next morning.
Look who's back.
- Great.
It's a miracle.
- I know.
It's Gracie.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I want to make a toast. I want to make a toast.
A toast.
To my amazing husband Larry... on our special anniversary.
And to my boyfriend Seth on our special anniversary.
And to my date Jesse... on our special anniversary too.
Happy anniversary.
Do you guys have any idea what we're toasting to?
Not a clue.
Not really.
Baby, what happened one year ago today?
Something important.
We took our first plane trip together... to Hawaii.
Hawaii.
Our first plane trip.
- Important.
- Of course.
What did we do two months ago?
- Oh, we...
- We moved in together.
Right.
I was gonna say that.
- One week ago?
- I've only known you a week.
Yes, silly.
One week ago, you saw me on Baywatch.... and told my agent to have me call you.
And I did like an hour later.
Yeah, all right.
Happy anniversary.
Cheers, everyone.
I would also like to make a special toast to Larry.
For introducing me to my future husband.
What?
My God, is this the big announcement?
No ring yet.
I'm sorry, honey.
That kind of slipped out.
It's okay.
My heart has resumed beating.
To Larry.
Thank you.
A little thirsty?
Did you see the look on Seth's face?
He looked like Wile E. Coyote hanging in midair thinking...
"I'm fucked."
Just keep dropping hints, spoil him rotten... and screw his brains out.
Believe me, he will come around.
If that doesn't work?
Never underestimate the power of tears.
Do you guys think Jesse likes me?
Honey, yes, he does like you.
He also likes every other girl in this town.
I'm sorry.
I thought you should know.
That's cool.
I just want him to take me to my prom.
"Love bears all things, believes all things... "Love bears all things, believes all things... hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails."
And I love you.
Happy Valentine's Day.
A new watch?
This is beautiful.
God, you shouldn't be spending this much money on me.
I knew you'd say that, so I put it on your MasterCard.
So I get the bonus miles too.
That's great.
Thank you.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Why are you crying?
You haven't even opened it yet.
My God, I know.
But if this is what I think it is...
- It's an amethyst.
- Yeah, it's your birthstone.
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.
God, that looks beautiful on you.
Hello. Pretend you just got a present.
I said it's nice.
Thank you.
Don't you want to make love?
Go ahead.
That will be nice.
I'll just lock up when I'm done.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What did I do?
It's my problem.
I'll be fine.
You want to talk to me?
- You don't want to know.
- Yes, I do.
I'm pretty sure.
It's just that we're at this romantic vacation resort... and I thought that you were going to... that you were going to propose.
Propose marriage?
Isn't that what people do when they're in love?
I thought we were just coming here to play golf.
I mean, marriage... That's a big step.
I mean, you're deciding is this the person I want to annoy... for the rest of my life.
I never want to make love to another man again.
And I never want to make love to another man either.
But I only want to get married once.
I watched my parents split up, and it was a major nightmare.
Dad became an alcoholic.
Mom became a lesbian.
Then Dad became a transvestite to get Mom back.
That was stupid... but I think my point about divorce is still very valid.
My parents have been married 42 years... and they are so happy.
We can be that happy.
Come on, baby.
Come on. Let's just get engaged.
Say, "Chelsea, will you marry me?"
All right, you don't have to set a date.
Just buy me the ring.
Four carats, colorless, grade E, Clarity:
VVS-1, emerald cut.
That would shut me up.
We're still getting to know each other, but at least now...
I know what kind of diamonds you like.
You are so unfunny.
Come on, Chels, you're making me crazy here.
Now we should talk.
If I am not the one for you, just tell me... so we can stop wasting each other's time.
What are you saying, marry me or it's over?
Either we're moving forward or we're standing still.
What does your heart say?
My heart says let's make a deal.
How about we live together for a predetermined amount of time... during which you agree never to bring up the "M" word.
When time's up, if things feel good... then we get engaged.
And exactly how long is this predetermined amount of time?
- Two years.
- What?
I am not waiting two years for you to see if things "feel good."
How about 18 months?
Six months.
One year.
But that's starting today.
No credit for time already served.
Deal?
Deal.
That was so beautiful.
Yeah.
I'm feeling the love.
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for coming to another taping of... Ronnie and Juliet.
Now, let's meet the stars of our show...
Jesse Travis and Rebecca Melini!
Ladies and gentlemen... we just found out... we were picked up for the entire season!
Good morning.
Are you ready for your sponge bath?
I am so ready.
It's very good that you're here because... I'm filthy.
I can clean everything... except that dirty mind of yours.
- Shit!
- What?
Seth hired that bimbo.
Thank you, nurse.
I can take over from here.
I'm sorry.
Only medical personnel can perform medical procedures.
Look here.
Either give me the sponge... or the proctologist will have to remove it.
You think he's doing her?
You are the coolest, hottest little honey dip in this town.
Only a complete schmuck would cheat on you.
I do not need to be this close to your head.
Here's an idea.
Why don't we get another sponge?
Then the two of you can give me a sponge bath?
Bad idea.
I told you the sponge bath would work.
- And cut!
- I am going to kill him!
Seth, how was I?
You were terrific, lady.
You're such a doll.
Good job, Tawny.
You give one heck of a sponge bath.
You are such an asshole!
Hi, honey.
A million bimbos in this town... and you hire the one I asked you not to.
Tawny gave the best reading... and she's not a bimbo.
Thank you, sweetie.
No, don't help.
Oh, my God, this is such bullshit.
Could we maybe talk about this at home?
Don't bother coming home.
God.
It's okay.
We have these pretend fights... so that we can pretend to make up... so that we can have pretend-fight/make-up sex.
It's fun.
- Good show.
- Great show.
Can we talk to you?
Break up and run for your life.
It's not that simple.
I love her.
You love a jealous, controlling, possessive bitch!
Shall I leave?
- Definitely not.
- You guys need help.
We'll get you a little couple counseling... and get her a whole bunch of anger management.
- You'll be fine.
- Larry, don't you get it?
That chick is a ticking time bomb.
Seth, get out of the building.
It's true.
Chelsea can be a tad dramatic.
And, yes, she's got a bit of a temper.
But for the most part, I think she's sweet... fun... heck of a homemaker and, come on... the sex is fucking outstanding... as in outstanding fucking.
We'll get you someone new.
Jasmine is it?
What about that redhead friend of yours at the tanning salon?
- Gina?
- Yes.
- Single and a freak.
- Great news.
Tell her to be at the planetarium in an hour.
- Call your cousin Eddie.
- Do you want to be single forever?
How cool will you look, rolling in your walker... chasing some toothless old lady?
You get better blow jobs if they're toothless.
- I hear.
- I say commit to the long run.
All couples have problems.
Work it out.
It's worth it.
Gina's out of gas, but if you bring a can of unleaded... to the Pinto stuck in the middle lane... of the Hollywood Freeway near the Melrose exit... she'll follow you home.
Go.
Knock, knock.
Is it safe to come in?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I saw that girl, the next thing I'm Glenn Close... looking for a rabbit to boil.
Look, honey, nothing's going on.
I forgot all about that night that you met that girl.
Can I please make it up to you?
What did you have in mind?
Back rub, blow job, breakfast in bed.
The three B's.
Yeah, that's got a shot at working.
Why are guys so easy?
And that was pretty much how the year went.
You guys would fight, make up and have make- up sex.
The next thing you know, it's Valentine's Day again:
The deadline.
Isn't it a little early to be in our pj's... Isn't it a little early to be in our pj's... cuddling by the fire?
Because it makes it more romantic.
And 3:00 is the perfect time to exchange gifts.
And I can't wait any longer.
Are you ready?
Yeah?
Happy Valentine's Day.
Fuck you.
I'm sorry.
I thought I just heard you say...
You're not proposing, are you?
Not today.
But...
Don't you even want to try them on?
They're so beautiful in the box. I bet on an actual earlobe... That would just be magnificent.
You son of a bitch!
You promised!
I did not promise.
Our deal was if and only if everything was great... then we would get engaged.
You have to admit, honey, it was a pretty rocky year.
Because you won't marry me.
What is your problem?
I am pretty.
I am sexy. I am fun.
And nobody will ever love you as much as I do.
So why won't you marry me?
What's the rush?
I don't get it.
Can't we just be together?
- You are never gonna marry me.
- What?
Honey, I never said never.
That's it!
Where is my bag?
I am out of here!
I need more time.
Big deal.
Wait!
Would you be happier if we weren't living together?
You know what?
For once in your dysfunctional... emotionally constipated, fear-filled... spiritually crippled existence... say what you want.
You know what I want.
Don't tell me I would be happier moving out.
If you want me to leave, open your fat mouth... and say the fucking words!
I think a little space might be good for the relationship.
You want space.
I will give you the fucking galaxy!
And here's what I think of your pathetic attempt to buy more time.
Wait!
Those cost $10,000!
Fishy, here's $10,000 worth of fish food!
That's it!
You have officially pissed me off!
You haven't had it so bad:
A free place to live, all expenses paid... vacations, clothes, more shoes than I've ever fucking seen.
You just threw away the best thing you'll ever have! You suck!
Hi, it's Seth.
Leave me a message.
If you want to talk to Chelsea, you should really ask yourself why!
God!
You thought you were finished with Chelsea... but the fun was just starting.
So Juliet says, "Ronnie, guess what?
My mom's moving in with us."
- And Ronnie says... - "Your mom?
That's not exactly what I had in mind... when I suggested you, me and another woman."
That's comedy.
I suggest we end on a high note.
Take the rest of the day off, start fresh in the morning.
I have a delivery for Seth Winnick.
- Yeah, that's me.
- Right on.
- Who's this from?
- Looks like your agent.
Just sign right there.
So this is the think tank?
- This isn't from my agency.
- It's a lawsuit.
You signed proof of service.
I'm sorry, dude.
But I really dig your show.
If you're looking for new writers... I brought my spec Frasier script.
- See?
It says "Frasier."
- Get out.
Right.
So, should I call you then?
- Should I leave it on your desk?
- Leave it in your ass!
Right on.
Walter Drooz?
Isn't he that scumbag lawyer, which is redundant.
- Right.
- He's an expert in...
Palimony.
- Hello!
- Shit.
- This is your fault.
- How is it my fault?
Because you said, "Work it out.
It's worth it."
- Obviously, you didn't work it out.
- No shit.
Look at this.
She claims I promised to marry her.
She gave up her career to act as my wife.
- She co-wrote all my scripts.
- I co-wrote all your scripts.
She wants half my income for the past year... plus my house and spousal support payments.
I'm sorry, man.
The girl is crazy!
But she's still fine.
- Holly got other friends...
- I think you've done enough.
Look who's back.
The antichrist.
Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Making veggie lasagna.
How lovely for you, but considering this joke of a lawsuit...
It's no joke.
You're in a heap of trouble.
Yeah, I'm scared to death.
Why don't you just get your stupid, lazy cat... and get out of here.
I think not.
I get my mail and phone calls here... which means this is my legal residence.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're not moving out?
Why are you doing this?
Couples break up every day.
They don't get lawyers.
They just move on with their lives.
Just go get an apartment.
I'll pay for it.
You'll pay for a lot more than that.
After everything I've done for you... think I'll let some other woman get all the benefits... and I get nothing?
Baby, it's too dark in here.
That's better.
Look at you, pretty girl.
- What are you doing?
- Let's brush you before bed.
Get that bad dander away.
Yes.
Look at it.
It's bad.
You look so pretty, honey.
So this is what hell is like.
You found yourself a real sweetheart.
She's got no case, right?
One year of cohabitation is not a marriage... but the beauty of American jurisprudence... is you can sue anybody for anything.
So who knows?
Rich TV producer versus poor working girl... sobbing, "He promised to marry me."
She might get some money.
But, Monica, I never promised to marry her.
Your word against hers.
And if this goes all the way to trial... this could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Just to break up with my girlfriend?
Can't I just kill her and get off?
This is Los Angeles.
I'm warning you, whatever happens... do not lay a finger on her or her possessions.
That's fine, but I cannot guarantee the safety of her cat.
- I didn't hear that.
- I'm just saying, accidents happen.
Lawn darts in the backyard... "Gracie, look out!"
One from behind.
- Look what Drew Carey is making.
- Yeah, I should be making that.
I'm here.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was at my lawyer's... dealing with my ex-girlfriend's palimony suit.
But don't worry because I can assure you... this will have no impact on the show.
So let's read this week's script entitled...
"Ronnie Smashes Juliet's Skull In With A Frying Pan."
I heard Monica Harris is your attorney.
- Drooz will eat her for breakfast.
- We'll see.
You might want to keep yourself scarce Saturday night about 7:00.
- I have a date.
- Good. I hope you marry him.
I'm so over the marriage thing.
Now I just want to go buck wild.
- You're such a pig.
- I am so sorry.
I had beans and broccoli for dinner... and washed them down with some crab cakes.
Goodness.
I am so sorry.
Would you like to spoon me?
I feel like I'm past the worst of it.
- I need some cuddle time.
- Stop it.
I was wrong.
Incoming.
My goodness.
I'm keeping the neighbors up.
Your feet are on fire.
Wait.
You're so gross.
Man, I've got skills.
I've got game.
- That's my date.
- Could be my date.
Listen, babe, you don't want to be around when my date shows up.
Same goes for you, babe.
You asked a woman to pick you up?
You have zero class.
It just so happens... - What's in your ear?
- My diamond earrings.
The diamond earrings that I gave you?
Yep.
The ones that you threw in the ocean?
Did you really think I would throw away... $10,000 worth of diamonds?
Slipped them in my little pink bra.
Goddamn.
As much as I hate you right now, that was a good move.
My God.
Did the network fire me?
They love you, as long as the ratings stay up.
Come in.
You look adorable.
Look at these.
They're beautiful.
Come with me.
Let's put them in some water.
All righty.
- These are so gorgeous.
- I'm glad you like them.
Wait a minute.
You're her date.
Marty's your date?
You weren't supposed to be here.
I begged him to stay upstairs.
You can't go out with her.
You're my agent.
You're supposed to at least pretend to be my friend.
Come on, Seth.
You know I hardly ever get laid, for free.
You guys broke up.
I just want to bang her a couple of times.
You don't mind, do you, buddy?
Excuse me.
He says he wants to bang you... because he never gets laid... because he's a lowlife, fucking worm!
She doesn't even like you.
She's just using you to get back at me.
I have no problem with this.
She's a bloodsucking, inhuman creature of the night... spawned from Satan's seed.
Yeah, once again, not a problem.
Hello?
Bad time?
Come on in.
You look adorable.
Look who's here, sleeping her way to the bottom.
She's just jealous because you're a stunning actress... and her date is a slimy bottom feeder... sponging off of people who actually have talent.
By the way, Marty, you are so fucking fired.
Fine by me.
I'll still commission Ronnie and Juliet.... and make a fortune off of you by doing nothing.
So nothing will change.
- What is she doing here?
- I live here.
Did Seth forget to tell you he's just using you... in a pathetic attempt to upset me?
Look who's talking.
By the way, Marty, when she gets into your pants... she's just looking for your wallet.
Playing with your dick is just to distract you.
Works for me.
All I ever wanted to do... was spend my life loving you... you disgusting sack of shit!
Then why did you hire the sleaziest lawyer in town... you pathologically deluded, morally bankrupt... in denial, self-esteem deficient bitch on wheels?
I am not in denial!
- I'm getting my purse.
- You are a freak of nature!
- Get away from me!
- You don't like me following you?
- Then move out!
- You move out!
- This is my house!
- Not for long!
- I dropped my last name.
- I saw your guest shot on ER.
Loved the way you overdosed.
But now my character can't come back.
Please. You should have your own series anyway.
I'm with Inventive Artists.
- Maybe we should do lunch.
- You need psychiatric help!
- You're beyond help!
- How about dinner tonight?
It's like you're reading my mind, pretty lady.
Sad, really.
You smell fantastic.
Do not tell me to shut up.
Say, "Be quiet."
Just stop talking.
Nice job.
You fucked up date night.
Gracie sleeps with the fish under the pier.
Somebody needs a bath.
Baby, Mommy's coming!
Yeah, here comes Mommy.
Oh, my God!
She's coming to save you because she loves you so much.
I, on the other hand, couldn't care less.
God, this is a long pier.
Shit.
Mommy's flagging a little.
I don't think she ate her Wheaties.
Don't hurt my cat!
Say good night, Gracie.
My God, she can't swim!
There's only one way to learn.
You do not want to do this.
Here.
Come on.
Just step back from the rail.
Let's talk about it.
Talking time is over.
Swimming time is here.
But don't worry, Gracie.
There's lots of yummy fish down there.
She won't answer to that.
You have to say Gracie!
My baby girl!
It's okay!
I am gonna kill you!
Didn't Gracie tell you?
She loves to bungee jump.
I can't believe you did that to my baby!
- Mommy's coming.
- By the way... the EPA estimates that about 10,000 people... take a dump in that water every day.
That's just a fun little fact.
My baby.
What did that bad man do to you?
Happy Valentine's Day.
Ronnie, is this what I think it is?
It's amethyst.
Yeah, your birthstone.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I was hoping for a diamond.
You thought I was gonna propose?
Why would we want to get married?
Our relationship is going so well.
But where the hell is it going?
Apparently back to the jewelry store to return the amethyst.
What the fuck is happening to my character?
Every week she's getting bitchier and more desperate.
Who thinks this is funny?
I find that all the best humor comes from life.
Not your life.
Yeah, you better fix this shit.
'Cause your fucked-up life is fucking up my show.
Ratings are going down... my personal TVQ is going down... and worst of all, Seth... the quality of my babes is going down.
You're not mad at me, though, right?
- Come on. Let's go smoke.
- Yeah.
Here.
My God.
My hair's falling out.
You know, stress will do that to you.
Holy shit.
It's really falling out.
That's so weird.
Oh, my God.
Jesus.
What did you do to me?
I didn't do anything.
You must have used my hair remover instead of your conditioner.
You put some in there to fuck with me!
I didn't do it.
I swear.
Man, you are the fucking devil!
Good morning.
You've got 15 seconds.
Go.
- You need extra-strength Rogaine.
- You look like a big-ass roll-on.
Mr. Clean called.
He wants his look back.
You look like a prick with two ears.
With two together, we'd have an ass.
Take some skin and comb it over.
It will look fuller.
Time.
Gracie, look at all your new roommates.
But you're still my favorite.
My, what a festive little dinner party.
- Nice rug.
- Thank you.
Going for a Chuck Woolery thing.
By the way, a couple of Gracie's new friends... accidentally knocked your Elvis plates off the shelf.
Accidentally?
I think they were bungee jumping.
You know how they love that.
So you moved into the nursery.
You figured it was only temporary... because next week was the settlement conference.... for Chelsea's palimony suit.
And after that, she'd be gone.
I want to know just what it's going to take to settle this case?
Your Honor, all my client wants is justice.
How much is justice going for today?
It's very difficult to put a price on a heart shattered by betrayal.
I'm sure you can find a way.
How much?
It really isn't all that simple.
Your Honor, Seth begged me to quit my job and move in with him.
I turned his empty, cold house... into a warm, cozy love nest.
I took care of his every need and desire... because he promised to marry me!
Bullshit.
Perhaps Mr. Winnick should suck a cough drop.
I'm good.
We're not here to try this case, we're here to settle it.
Your Honor, my client is willing to forego her pursuit of justice... for the more than reasonable sum of...
Half a million dollars?
You two should be wearing ski masks and carrying guns.
This is fucking robbery.
Mr. Winnick, watch your mouth.
Sorry. We believe he's suffering from Tourette's syndrome.
- Fucker!
- You see?
A trial is a year away at least.
During that time, you'll spend a half a million dollars... in legal fees alone.
Walter, you're a lawyer.
So I'm sure you're familiar with the legal term "suck my dick."
I think not!
- There goes that Tourette's again.
- This is unbelievable.
- I won't put up with this!
- He does not have Tourette's.
- This is a ransom note.
- You're such a liar.
You lie.
People, shut the hell up!
For the love of God.
This mandatory settlement conference is over.
I'm ordering that neither party... annoy or molest the other in any way... until this matter is resolved!
Yes, Your Honor.
Schmucks.
I'm checking into the spa this weekend... so I'll be out of your hair... or your rug.
- Don't forget to feed the cats.
- I'll teed them.
Feed them to the coyotes.
Chelsea Turner checking in, please.
- Welcome to the spa.
- Thank you.
Your reservation was canceled.
And the hotel is sold out.
Canceled?
I didn't cancel anything.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Which way to the massage center?
- It's right over there, sir.
Terrific.
Have a lovely day.
- And you too.
- Nice people.
Lovely rooms.
Life is good.
Relax.
Feel the clay mask and seaweed wrap... melt away your stress.
Now keep your eyes closed.
That feels nice.
- Time for your next treatment.
- Great.
What's next?
The super cleansing colonic volcano.
Colonic?
Isn't that where you go through the...
You know what?
I think I'm going to pass... on the super cleansing colonic volcano.
- But thank you.
- Your wife said you might be nervous.
Yeah, well, that's not my wife.
That's Lucifer, angel of darkness.
He can change forms.
Please unwrap me.
I can't move.
Just relax.
Drop the probe and step away from my ass!
Take a deep breath and just go with the flow.
But... No flow.
Don't want the flow.
Don't need the...
I feel you clenching.
Now, no clenching.
Have you done this before?
Very professional.
Fill your lungs with air.
You have lovely lungs.
Hello.
Hi.
You look super clean.
Yeah, I can't walk so good, but I feel 20 pounds lighter.
- Can we talk?
- Bad timing, pal.
- We're mid-pump.
- Yeah, thank you.
Could we call a truce?
I can't take this anymore.
I'm sure that we can settle this.
Just you and me, no lawyers.
Speaking of lawyers, you're annoying and molesting me.
What?
Back off, toothpick.
How about this?
- Are you listening?
- Not really.
I give you $50,000.
You move out.
Everyone's happy.
I'm not happy yet, but keep trying.
How about this?
An even 100 grand.
An extremely fair offer.
Come on.
You know we still care about each other.
Let's just stop fighting.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Yes.
Wait a second.
Yes, that would be nice or, yes, we have a deal?
Yes, we have a deal.
Hi, toothpick.
What?
Don't scream at me.
Talk to the Sasquatch.
- You could have let go of me!
- You could have not been flirting.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I hate you.
- I hate you more.
- I wish I never met you.
- God, you make me sick!
- You turn my stomach!
- Don't stop.
- Don't tell me what to do!
- Then shut up and do it faster!
You shut up and do it faster.
God, that feels good!
- Oh, God!
- Me too!
- That was different.
- That was great.
Do you think it's better if you hate the other person?
Definitely.
You thought the lawsuit was over... until you got that call from your lawyer.
Sorry about that.
Gotta get those brakes fixed.
- What are you doing here?
- Making sure there's no trouble.
How are you?
What's with this 200 grand bullshit?
Walter said it wouldn't kill you to be a little more generous.
Walter is on a percentage.
So the more that Walter squeezes out of me... the more that goes into Walter's pocket.
We shook hands.
- We had sex.
- Hate sex.
- Here's more good news.
- What?
A restraining order.
It states you shall vacate the premises immediately... and shall not travel within 200 feet of Miss Turner's residence.
All contact to be made through your attorneys.
How'd you swing this?
Walter told the judge how you followed me... to the spa and were stalking me.
- It wasn't my idea.
- You didn't try and stop him.
So I can't live in my house?
You've got 15 minutes to collect your things.
Bite me.
In fact, both of you can bite me.
You should have married me.
So what, she has your house?
You still get the tax write-off.
The blessing-in-disguise bullshit doesn't work.
That just makes me more bitter.
But thank you.
Hi, guys.
Hey, sweetheart.
- It looks like Seth's moved in.
- He just needs a place to crash.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?
- Suppose Chelsea came to visit me?
Wouldn't that be awkward?
Let's not worry about hypothetical situations.
Now can we worry?
You really shouldn't be this close.
If I wasn't such a nice person, I could have you arrested.
You call the police because I'm staying here... and, technically, you're in my home.
That decision has not been finalized.
Larry said it was okay.
- But Larry forgot to check with me.
- Bad Larry.
Can't you two try and work this thing out?
I offered her 100 grand.
She says she wants 200.
Are you crazy?
You do not owe her a penny!
Sweetie, I think that's for a jury to decide.
You think she should get paid for being his girlfriend?
Chelsea invested her time and her love and her body!
But they weren't married.
If you walk down the aisle, that's one thing.
There's a chance you may get the shaft.
Wait.
You're saying alimony is unfair?
My point is she's acting like a hooker... that's trying to get a court to make her trick pay up.
- Don't call my best friend a hooker.
- You're right.
A hooker lets you know the price up front.
The bottom line is... I do not want this bald-headed, wig-wearing man staying here.
Too late.
I already told him... he could stay in my house!
- Your house?
- Yeah.
Have you ever heard of community property, Lawrence?
We need a room.
Would you like two queens or one king size bed?
Two queens.
The beds, not us.
I bought some roses and went crawling back to my wife.... but you hit the mini bar and got wasted.
- You don't want me to move in?
- Of course, I want you to move in.
Then what is this pre- prenuptial agreement all about?
It just says if we ever break up, you can't sue me.
Why would I sue you?
And why would we break up?
We wouldn't, honey.
You can sign this knowing.... that it's completely unnecessary.
- Then why bother?
- Who knows?
Maybe someday, you'll get mad at me for something.
How about for making me sign this agreement?
And then it hit you.
There was only one way out of this mess.
Gracie, it's me.
I'm sorry, baby, but you left me no choice.
Yes, Elvis.
Daddy's back.
You're probably a little upset with me.
Upset?
No, I'm thrilled.
Because kidnapping is a felony, which means you're going to jail.
Then you'll know what it's like to be the angry girlfriend.
Look... I'm sorry about the chloroform... but I had to get you here.
It's the perfect place to do this.
You will never get away with this.
They will know that you killed me.
Do you think I would actually kill you?
Sure, I've thought about it.
Every day.
But the sad fact is... I'm crazy about you.
Look.
I think there's a reason... that you couldn't just take the money and move on.
We belong together.
Hell, we deserve each other.
- What are you doing?
- Eddie.
Our long, dark night is over.
My darling... - Yeah.
- Don't even think of doing this.
It is way too late to try...
Oh, God!
Four carats.
Colorless.
Grade E.
Clarity:
VVS-1.
Emerald cut.
It's perfect.
Will you marry me?
If this is a joke, I will kill you.
No joke and no prenup either.
This time, what's mine is yours.
And we're selling the house full of bad memories.
Good God, it's like the Manson Ranch over there.
We'll just buy another one.
Fresh start.
So we've had a few bad months.
We're gonna be happy the rest of our lives.
We'll just fly to Vegas and do it.
Vegas?
When I get married, I want white doves and the horse-drawn carriage.
I want all of my friends and family there.
I want everything to be perfect.
Our friends and our families already think that we're insane.
Do you think that anybody would even come?
Hell, no.
Let's just get married.
And then when they see we are making it work... then we'll renew our vows... and have the big wedding.
Will you marry me?
Come on, baby.
Don't think about it.
Just say yes.
I'll help you.
- Yes.
- Yes?
Come here, woman!
Holly and I were the first to hear the wonderful news.
You're a moron.
That's not very professional, is it?
I'll need papers dismissing the palimony suit.
We'll sign them right before we get married.
I better start on the prenup.
No need.
We're in love.
We're never breaking up again.
You put your house up for sale.
We want a ten-day escrow.
We can't wait to move in.
- Ten days?
- It's okay, sweetie.
We just rent while we look for our dream house.
- Ten days.
You got a deal.
- Excellent.
You had Chelsea's ring appraised and insured for $75,000.
Damn!
Chelsea picked out her wedding gown.
She was in heaven, and so were you.
You turned Ronnie and Juliet back into the show that everyone loved.
Come on, Jules.
Let's go eat Mexican.
Cutie, I feel like Chinese.
- You know the cure for that?
- What?
Chicken burritos.
All of a sudden I'm craving egg foo young.
- I love you.
- I love you more.
No, I do.
And cut!
I'm going home.
Cover for me.
Great show.
The love is back.
The ratings are back.
And my babes are back.
I've got an idea.
I think Ronnie and Juliet should get married for May sweeps.
I'm getting married myself.
Not to the psycho lawsuit girl.
Her name is Chelsea, and she's right here.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.
- Thank you.
- So here we are.
Seth, for the last time, I'm begging you:
- Call it off!
- You know what?
If I'd just married her to begin with... none of this shit would have happened.
So just wish me luck.
You need more than luck.
You need Jesus, Moses.
- Muhammad.
Buddha.
- Thank God.
- It's about time.
- I'm not going in there.
Hello.
What were those men doing in there?
We're plumbers. Yeah.
- Well-dressed plumbers. Go on.
- Do your thing, little man.
- Baby, we're getting married!
- That's right, little darling!
And what better place than in Viva Las Vegas!
This is great.
We'll tie the knot, a little gambling, some hookers...
- Honey...
- Okay, no gambling.
This place is classy!
Thank you very much.
You're a fantastic audience.
In the words of the king... love each other tender and don't be cruel.
That way you'll never be all shook up in heartbreak hotel.
Do you take Seth to be your lawful wedded husband... for better or worse... richer or poorer... as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Do you take Chelsea as your lawfully wedded bride... for better or worse, richer or poorer... as long as you both shall live?
L...
I don't think so.
What?
Thank God.
Security!
Keep an eye on the bride.
- She's got a wee bit of a temper.
- No problem.
Make sure you stick between us.
You're not marrying me?
Why not, son?
That was a beautiful ceremony.
It was lovely, but the fact remains... that when we broke up, she hired a prick lawyer... and sued me for palimony.
But today Chelsea dismissed her lawsuit... and she moved out of my home... forfeiting any legal claim to live there.
Your stuff is in the Store-lt-All, unit 48.
- Did you know anything about this?
- I swear, I don't know anything.
Nobody knew except for my dentist and his assistant... who bought my home and will be selling it back to me tomorrow.
- He didn't.
- I think he did.
And my jeweler who said that piece of glass... on her finger was worth 75 grand.
But we're in Vegas.
- Let's party!
- You're the devil in disguise
Yes, you are
You fooled me with your kisses
He's lost his damn mind.
What the hell is he...
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got mine
She shot me in the ass!
- I got her!
- Somebody call an ambulance.
Wait!
Give me the gun!
There's still four bullets left!
Stop wiggling, ma'am.
Watch it!
There's a bullet in there!
- I'll see you in court!
- I'll see you in jail!
Yeah?
I'll sue you for tricking me into signing that dismissal.
I will sue your ass for damages... for damaging my ass!
Watch your head, ma'am.
Pull in the train, ma'am.
Be careful with the dress!
I will get married someday!
Someday, ma'am.
Why are you arresting me?
He's the one who should be arrested!
He's the one who lied and made me temporarily insane!
You have put me off women.
I'm gay now!
That's right!
And not just a little gay!
Full-on, Liberace gay!
I like show tunes!
You asshole!
Back to hell, demon!
- We need new friends.
- Yeah.
You want to stay on your stomach, sir?
Pal, that's not where the bullet is.
I'm not really gay, all right?
God!
Can you believe that creep wouldn't marry me?
- No, ma'am.
- You'd marry me, right?
- No, ma'am.
- Of course you would.
