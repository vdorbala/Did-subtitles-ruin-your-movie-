Ohh, you're so good.
Ohh, yes.
I am the best, baby. - Oh, yeah!
Oh, that was a tit.
That is a tit!
Yes!
Oh, you're so big!
Yeah, that's right, baby.
- Oh, doggie wants to hide his bone. - Yes!
Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smuggling', baby.
Man, would you shut up!
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.
Good night, Mom.
Kiss good night.
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- There's...
There's this nature show that I'm trying to watch. - Take it off.
- And the birds are all scrambled and I can't even... - Do me!
Yes!
Baby!
Ride me like a pony!
The thing must be broken or I sat on the remote or something.
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- Yup, I'm all set, Dad. I'm all set. - Yeah?
No, I think he's tried to watch some illegal channels.
Illegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.
- Oh, spank my hairy ass! - What's that?
- Ooh, baby!
- You know what? Here.
Just give me this, please...
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this...
Okay, okay.
Let's, uh...
What the hell's the matter with this thing?
Yes!
Illegal channels?
Shit!
If there's any channel that should be illegal, it's that "all-woman's" channel.
- Lifetime supply of pantyhose or some shit. - Yeah.
Hey, uh, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? - No.
- Ariel, man.
She's so hot!
- She's a mermaid, dude.
- Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's party. We got to go. It'll be great.
Why?
All that happens at Stifler's parties is people get drunk and do it.
Yeah.
Now, come on, Kevin. Open it.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in. If you think so, just open it.
Fine.
"Dear Miss Latham:
We're sorry but after keeping you on the waiting list... for the past couple of months, we've decided that you are now rejected."
Shut up!
- You got in.
- Yes!
I love you!
Okay.
Hey, you think I should wear this shirt to Stifler's party?
You've worn that shirt for, like, three days in a row, man!
Guys.
She said it.
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.
- Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?
- Oh, man!
Cornell's not that far from "U" of "M."
Yeah, it's only, like, seven hours.
Oh, and you get to drive across Canada.
- Beautiful country.
- Whatever. It's doable.
Wh-What we should do today, in band.
Instead of playing our instruments regularly, we should play them backwards.
- That'll be so funny! - Yeah.
No offense, but you're talking about a post-high school, long-distance relationship.
And you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What do you expect him to drive to Cornell for?
Milk and cookies? We're gonna have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.
It's got to be completely perfect.
I want the right time, the right moment, the right place...
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch.
It's sex.
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy? - Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy? - Same ol'...
- Finch.
You got the Latin homework?
Oh.
It means, "My dog ate it." It's Latin.
- It's a Latin joke. - Yeah, Latin.
Just drink your coffee.
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?
What I'm drinking, it's mochaccino.
'Nova!
What's up, dude?
You comin' to the party tonight, Ozzie, you fuckface?
Uh, depends if my date wants to stop by.
- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.
How about you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink-wrap and fucking use them!
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.
I'll look for you in the no-fucking section.
All right. I'm shooting for a 9:00 E.T.A. beer in hand by five after.
Breath check.
Thank you.
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- So, you got something up your sleeve for tonight?
This is a foolproof plan, my friend.
I have a serious question to ask you guys.
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian chick?
She might be there tonight.
Now, do you think she would prefer...
Laid-back Jim... or...
Cool, hip Jim?
I don't think it really matters with that shirt you're wearing.
Correct me if I'm wrong but you're the one with the girlfriend... and you're still stranded on third base.
Hey, at least I know what third base feels like, okay?
- You're still just a batboy. - Batboy.
Batboy. What are you talking about?
Guys, uh...
What exactly does third base feel like?
You wanna take this one?
- Like warm apple pie. - Yeah?
- Yeah.
Apple pie, huh?
McDonald's or homemade?
Gentlemen, destiny awaits.
♪ It's been one week since you looked at me ♪
♪ Cocked your head to the side and said, I'm angry ♪
That's number five and six for the Stif-meister!
Yeah.
Oops!
- H-Hey! Nadia!
Buenos días.
Glad you could make it.
I'll be back for you later.
- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?
Welcome to Stifler's Palace of Love, fellas.
- The keg's back there!
Enjoy! - Yeah.
Vicky, Jessica!
Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.
Haha, bitches!
- Sherman!
What the fuck are you doin' here?
What's goin' on?
Fellas!
What's goin' on? Sherman.
Not much.
Just, uh, scoping' the babes.
Indeed! Some fine ladies here, boys.
Confidence is high. Repeat.
Confidence is high.
Sherman is movin' to DEFCON 2.
- Full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You have somethin' going' tonight, Sherman?
You see that Central chick, Bernette?
- Um, no.
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.
Fellas, it's time she experienced... the Shermanator.
Yeah, okay, Sherman. Whatever.
I'm a sophisticated sex robot sent back through time... to change the future for one lucky lady.
Go get 'em, tiger.
I'll be back!
- Hopeless.
- Completely.
- Hi.
- Hey, Vic.
Oh, shit. Guys... Guys...
There's Nadia and she just looked at me.
- She just looked at me.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.
Yeah, I could do that. Sure.
Sure.
Kev?
Kev?

We're here for the party.
What party?
There's no party.
Weird.
Try the house down the street.
So, what's your major?
Post-modern feminist thought.
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?
Sure.
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the springtime that's just cool, you know?
Like the smell of fresh rain or somethin'.
Suck me, beautiful.
What did you just say?
Suck me, beautiful.
My friends call me "'Nova," as in Casanova.
That's pathetic.
Jeez, you don't have to laugh at me.
Well, there's just some things you need to learn, that's all.
- Like what? - Well, you've got to tone it down.
You don't need to come to a place like Lookout Point... and spout off cheeseball lines to be romantic.
- Okay. - You have to pay attention to a girl.
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.
Vicky, think it's time to take the next step in our relationship?
- Tonight? - Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.
I mean, it's how you've always pictured it, isn't it?
Dude, you gotta take a shit! You smell like a Yeti!
Or not.
Just relax.
You actually said that?
Shut up!
You did a hell of a lot better than I did with Nadia.
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.
Hey, no problem, 'Nova.
Hey, don't call me 'Nova anymore. I'm a...
I'm a fraud.
You guys are pathetic.
I'm gonna find myself a little hottie.
"Suck me, beautiful"!
- Let me know.
Keep going.
I should be able to talk to girls.
I'm articulate.
You know, I got a 720 on my S.A.T. Verbal.
Bullshit. There's no way.
I kid you not, man. Look. Listen.
Copious.
Verisimilitude.
Oh, ohh.
Now.
Suck me, beautiful!
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!
- Please, vacate the room. - You are such a jerk.
God, I can't believe how many cool people are at this party.
Yup.
And you got a keg too!
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.
No. No.
Here, babe!
Thanks.
You're really beautiful. Oh...
- Really? - Oh, yeah.
You know what?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
- Doing what?
- You know, like, if we hook up tonight, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
No way!
Steve, you could at least look at me when you say that!
Look.
Sarah,
I... I wouldn't go telling stories or anything about you.
I promise.
So, just... relax, take it slow... and let the good times roll.
- Okay. - All right.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Xenophobic.
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky? I mean, h-have you just never had one with Kevin... or have you never had one, period?
I've had one.
- I think.
- Okay.
That's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex.
You tell me you never even had one manually?
- I've never tried it.
- You've never double-clicked your mouse?
Ha-ha, nice!
Jesus!
Stifler, how much did you drink, man?
Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?
- Fuck you! - Ooh, whoo!
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.
I cannot believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler.
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF." - What the hell is that?
- M-I-L-F...
Mom I'd like to fuck.
- Yeah, dude!
- Yeah!
MILF!
MILF! - Hey, guys... Guys.
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?
Yeah, uh... Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact?
I got company, if you know what I mean?
She's hot!
If Sherman has sex before I do, I'm gonna be really pissed.
Sherman?
The Shermanator?
Come on, man.
MILF!
MILF!
MILF! MILF!
Dude, hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?
Enough of this blow job bullshit.
- I gotta get laid already. - That's nice.
Really, really nice.
- Can I have a ride?
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch. Where were you last night, huh?
What happened to that foolproof plan of yours?
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late entrance and I was too late.
So, no ladies left.
It was a very special night, very special.
Guys.
- I'll never forget this.
- Oh, I'll never forget it, either.
- Thank you.
- Uhh. - Well, bye.
- Bye.
Fellas, say good-bye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.
I... am now a man.
I highly recommend you join the club.
We were doin' the wild thing...
all night.
I'm exhausted.
I don't get it. I mean, how the hell did you do that?
It was just my time.
It was just my time.
Best of luck to you boys.
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys. You know, we should be happy for Sherman.
No, we shouldn't be.
You know, I put in months of quality time with Vicky.
Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores.
- This is just wrong.
- No shit. How the hell am I supposed to become Mr. Sensitive Man?
You know, we're all gonna go to college as virgins.
You realize this, right?
I mean, they probably have special dorms for people like us.
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.
It's really simple.
We just got to make an agreement.
Er, nah. It's... It's more than an agreement.
- What? A bet?
- A pact.
No money involved.
More important than any bet.
Here's the deal. We all get laid before we graduate.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Think about when you work out, Oz. You gotta have someone there, right?
Someone to spot you. Someone to keep you motivated.
Well, that's exactly what we can do for each other.
I mean, we'll be there to keep each other on track.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable, but together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny.
Their tiger-style kung fu is strong.
But our dragon-style will defeat it.
- Guys!
- The Shaolin masters from East and West must unite!
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.
We must make a stand, here and now.
No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused!
We will fight for every man out there who isn't getting laid and should be.
This is our day.
This is our time.
And, by God, we will not stand by and watch history condemn us into celibacy.
- Amen. Yes.
- I like that.
- We will make a stand.
We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!
- We will get laid! - Yeah! - Yeah!
Now, the sex:
It's got to be valid, consensual sex.
No prostitutes. That's what you're thinkin', Finch.
Busted.
So, basically, prom is our last chance.
- Oh, dude.
Prom sucks. - I know, but you gotta think about it this way.
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it. - Yeah-yeah, he's right. It's, like tradition or something.
- So, that gives us... - Exactly three weeks to the day.
- We're gonna do this.
- All right, to the next step!

Well, if you want to get her in the sack, I mean, just tell her you love her.
- That's how I was duped.
- Look, Jessica,
I - I don't want to dupe her.
All right. What you need to do... is learn how to press a girl's buttons.
You have to give her what she's never had.
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.
Ohh, Kev!
Uhh.
Yeah.
- Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.
- You got it, stud!
- Well, you know,
I'm-I'm pretty sure that I've... given her a...

- Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action? - Yeah.
- I-I think you sounded pretty good. - Yeah, man.
I think you need your balls reattached.
- Hey, keep it down, dude. - What the fuck are you doing here?
This place is an untapped resource.
I mean, check it out.
- These vocal jazz girls are hot.
- Why the hell is he joining jazz choir so late?
Maybe he's preparing for another senior year at East?
You guys, we don't even know him.
You dipshit!
You're expecting to score with some... goody-goody choirgirl priss?
These chicks don't know me.
I can work the sensitive angle here, fellas!
You know, it's just like that college chick told me.
All that you gotta do is just ask 'em questions... and listen to what they have to say and shit.
I don't know, man. That sounds like a lot of work!
Uh, just a second!
Come in.
Oh, Jim, you're here.
Uh, I was just walking by your room and uh... And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy, it's been a long time since we've had... a little father-son, uh-uh, chat."
I almost forgot.
I, uh, I bought some magazines.
Do you just want to flip to the center section?
Well, this is the... this is the, uh, female form.
And they have focused on the breasts, uh, which are used primarily to, uh, feed young infants... - and, uh... and also, uh, in foreplay.
- Right.
This is, uh... This is Hustler.
And this is a much more exotic magazine.
Now, they have decided to focus on the, uh, pubic region...
- Right. - The whole groin area.
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that?
See what's she's doing? She's kind of looking right into your eyes saying,
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"
- You see? - Right.
Shaved is a magazine I'm not too familiar with, but, again, if you flip to the center...
Section... Well, you see the detail that, uh, that they go into in this picture here.
- Uh-huh. Yeah. - It almost looks like a tropical plant or something...
- Yeah. Yes. - Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Well, don't say, "Oh..."
- Yes, I know what a clitoris is.
Oh, you do. Oh, I see.
Yes, you do.
I forgot you've been there and back.
- You know everything...
- I've learned about it in Sex Ed... - I really don't need you to talk about clitoris.
- I'm trying to make this painless...
- You know what?
I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have got hot there.
Well, you know what I'm going to do, Jim.
I'm going to just leave these books here... for you to, uh, peruse at your, uh... at your leisure.
Wait!
Well, safer than a tube sock.
- Okay, that... That was good.
- See you at dinner.
- Uh, yeah. I'll see you at dinner.
So, Finch, this is your plan?
You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing.
Kevin, I'm sure that they're not.
Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in.
- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know? - Sure, what do you need?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.
Look, I gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
You know, Finch, it's... it's senior year.
I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school?
Excuse me.
Uh, that's Paul Finch, right? - Yeah.
- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right?
- Uh, yeah.
- So, my friends, they want to know. Is it true?
You know, that he's... equipped.
I have no idea.
Finch showers with his bathing suit on.
I mean, uh...
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!
- Does he have a date for the prom yet? - No, definitely not.
All right.
Thanks.
Oh, man!
So I was thinking maybe you could give me some advice, brother to brother.
I thought you might know a trick or somethin' to make her...
- Orgasm? - Yeah.
- What's good here?
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll. - What?
- How do you do that?
- Hey, never mind that.
Listen, pay attention.
Is that all that you're interested in, tryin' to get your girl into bed?
No, it'd be good to be able to, you know, return the favor.
Be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do. See that?
That's good.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Now, you qualify.
- Qualify for what?
- My man, you've just inherited the Bible.
It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam.
And each year it got passed on to one East student who was worthy.
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff that guys have added over the years.
But you have to keep it a secret and return it at the end of the year.
All right. So now you know.
Good luck.

Yeah.
So, you've got this sort of Frank Sinatra thing going on.
I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.
I mean, uh, music is so expressive.
Okay.
I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone...
- with your lacrosse stick or something?
- Oh, sure. Sure.
You know, I know what people think.
"Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."
You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,
- that's not all that I am, you know? - Of course, I didn't...
I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You think I don't get that?
God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, "Oh, look.
There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."
So, like, what else do you do?
Well, the same things you do, like hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why?
What do you think I do? - Oh, I...
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
- Oh, well, what do you want to know?
You know, stuff... about you.
All right.
Mom, I'm home!
- Jim!
- It's not what it looks like.
Well, we'll just tell your mother that, uh... that, uh... we ate it all.
Goal by number eight, Chris Ostreicher.
- Nice game. Good game.
Hey, what are you doin' here?
Just enjoying my first exhilarating lacrosse experience.
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks. - Um, Chris...
- Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want.
- You can call me Ostreicher.
- What's your middle name?
- Nah, forget it.
- Come on. I won't tell anyone. - Well, neither will I.
Okay. Um.
So, I had this thought and...
It may seem like it's way out of left field.
I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anybody, I thought that maybe...
Those guys sucked ass!
Choir chick, what the hell are you doing here?
Well, uh, I was asking Chris to prom.
So, do you want to go?
Oh, yeah! That would be great.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo!
Stifler, fuck! I mean...
Why do you got to be so insensitive all the time?
What?
Whatever. Look, uh, don't forget. My cottage after prom.
On Lake Michigan.
Hey, wait up, you pussies. Where you goin'?
Ah, well, I gotta... I gotta hit the showers now, but I think this is gonna be really, really good. - Yeah.
Me too. - All right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
- 'Appenin' Oz!

Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here.
Well, that was a fun day wasn't it?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Jim, I want to talk about masturbation.
Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.
And I have to admit, uh, you know.
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
I, uh...
I used to call it "stroking the salami."
Yeah, you know, "pounding the ol' pud."
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort?
He "pinched the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day.
See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game.
You see?
It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.
- Right. No.
- It's not a game.
What you want is you want a partner to return the ball.
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.
- You do want a partner?
- Oh, I want a partner.
- Want a partner. Good. Good.
Good.
So, once Hal becomes king, he has to take on... the responsibilities of leadership and turn his back... on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff. You see, Hal is going through a... rite of passage, much like you all are.
So, does your tongue cramp up?
Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.
That's amazing.
She's probably gonna want to do it soon.
All right.
Class dismissed.
Still questing after the Holy Grail, huh, guys?
Hey, uh, where's Finch?
Oh, he went home to take a shit.
I don't get it.
How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
- What reputation?
- Observe.
Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?
Yeah!
He's the guy with the tattoo, right?
You know, the eagle and the blazing fire and that stuff.
Well, um, if you guys see him later, will you tell him Courtney says hi?
Bye.
Okay.
Explain.
I can't.
I don't know how he's doing it.
I, uh... I guess that just leaves Jim trailing.
- Aw, Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!
Yeah, I know.
James?
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Me?
Y-Yes.
No, uh...
- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you could help me with my studies.
Uh, yeah.
Absolutely.
Tha-Tha-Tha... That would be...
That would be great sometime.
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practice.
Perhaps I could come by your house afterwards?
I could change clothes at your place.
Oh.
Uh... yeah.
I suppose that would be okay.
Nice car!
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about?
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
No, wait.
You're a jerk.
Wait!
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Heather, I wasn't makin' fun of you.
Gimme a break. You're so full of it.
Fuck me!
There's gonna be an Eastern European chick naked in your house.
And you're not gonna do anything about that?
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?
- Yeah.
- You can do that?
No.
I cannot do that to her.
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.
If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one?
I don't like the kid, but he's got a point.
See, even shit-brick knows you should do it.
All you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the 'Net... and tell me the address.
You can send me the address too.

I-I really don't think they liked it.
How do you know that?
She's already on a plane back home.
Yeah.
You know, guys?
Maybe I'm just not good with girls, period.
No-no-no, really-really. Like...
Like I was born without that part of the brain.
I mean, I can't talk to girls.
And when I do talk to them, I screw it up.
Yeah, well, come prom those excuses aren't going to do you any good.
And one time at band camp, we weren't supposed to have pillow fights, but we had a pillow fight, and it was so much fun.
And this one time, we all lost our music and we were supposed to play this song, but we didn't know it, so we just made it up and we kept playing and playing, and the conductor didn't know what we were doing, and it was so funny.
So, you're pissed about somethin', huh.
You know what I do when I'm angry?
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.
- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh...
You have no idea why I'm angry?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky... when I know I have a big test to study for.
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...
- because this one time at band camp...
- W-What's your name?
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.
Michelle, um...
Do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?
You seriously want to go with me?
Yes. Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?
Because that would be so cool.
- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool!
We're gonna have such a good time.
It'll be like this one time at band camp when we all had a campfire...
Hi.
- How'd you know I was here?
- Stifler told me.
- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, I needed to find you.
We're gonna have to work on that song.
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.
So you work nights?
- My dad's the manager.
Cool.
Tell him the subs are great.
- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah. My parents want me to go to Northwestern, but...
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?
So when my "U" of "M" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it.
- Onions? - What?
You, uh, want onions?
Oh, no, thank you.
So what are you gonna major in?
State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team.
Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh?
I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player?
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor?
Yeah.
What are you talkin' about?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me.
Finch.
Shit-brick.
Oh, gosh.
I-I forgot.
You look okay.
I-I mean, the scars healed really well.
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.
What was that all about?
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that?
What do you mean, "no comment"?
- Did you two hook up or something?
- What, are you kidding?
Then how did all this get started?
Well, I guess it's all right for me to tell you now.
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Cheese, please.
Finch comes up to me and says, "Jessica,
I need your help with this, blah, blah, etcetera."
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks, and I'll tell a couple of girls that you're dynamite in bed."
So he did, and I did.
- That actually works? - Well, duh!
Of course.
Naturally, I embellished a little bit.
Did you hear that Finch had an affair with an older woman?
No, I didn't hear that one.
That one was my favorite.
- ♪ Thank you, baby ♪ She calls me up... ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪
Oh, my God, you're gay!
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
No, thanks, man.
You've been singin' that shit all week.
If you try that at M.S.U. This Saturday, I'll kick your ass.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Yeah, well, shit.
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass.
But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by.
So you can't sing at the competition.
Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right. Listen, thanks for understanding.
So, uh, I guess I'll see you later?
Hey, Kevin.
- You seen shit-brick lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?
Me?
Nothing.
See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked.
But, uh, I'll tell you one thing, though.
I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
Slipped a little something into his mochaccino.
Oh, God!
Oh!
Oh!
Right this way, sir.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
It's gonna be fun.
You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations.
You're just saying that because prom's a week away and you don't have a date.
No, no, no.
I don't want a date.
Finch is goin' stag and... so am I.
God, he's like so...
refined.
You think that older woman thing is true?
Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.
Joanie, was that you?
- Can't hold it.
Kev?
I think we've come...
- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.
Maybe it's time... we start to express ourselves in new ways.

- Yeah.

It's your turn.
That's not what I was thinking.
Sex.
It's always about sex.
It's not always about sex.
I just thought it was about sex this time.
Look, Vicky, love is a term that gets thrown around, and-and people don't mean it.

Jessica, this is great!

No, I spent 50 on the flask, 150 on the earrings.
- These are, uh...
- Let me just clarify...
- that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch.
- Of course not!
So I take it you and Sherman are pretty close, huh?
You met at that party a while back, right?
Yeah, we were up all night together.
We had one of those amazingly deep conversations... where you feel like you really get to know someone.
Deep conversation, huh?
Is that what you call it?
What else would I call it?
Thank you, Great Falls.
We're gonna take a little break.
You are beautiful.
You suck!
Excuse me, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.
I just thought you all should know this.
Chuck Sherman is a liar.
I never had sex with him.
He's never had sex with anyone.
I know this because he told me.
Once he tried to screw a grapefruit, but that's all.
Oh. He also told me that when he gets nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.
Thank you for your time.
- Guess what?
- Not interested.
Kevin.
Come on, man. The bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
- I'm not going.
Why not?
Look, things didn't really turn out how I wanted them to.
I mean, I don't even know what I'm doin'.
I-I'm acting like I've got everything together tonight.
I know that Vicky's gonna ask me if I love her, and...
I don't know what I'm gonna say.
I mean, I'm on the brink.
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.
I don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe I am just scared.
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.
We-We are finally going to a post-prom party on the lake.
We have been waiting for this for four years.
Why else have we been friends with Stifler all this time, right?
We were friends with Stifler?
Hey, look.
Sherman didn't even get laid.
- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.
What?
We'll tell you on the bus.
I'm gonna go inside and grab my bag.
My date too, perhaps?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
That reminds me of this one time...
Hey, can I ask you a question?
How come you don't have any stories?
I've got lots of them, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories. Believe me. They're just, uh...
They're just a little more risque than tales of band camp.
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!
Okay. You want a story?
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer...
- This is the nicest room in the house.
- Kev, it's perfect.
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't ya?
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers!
- Out.
- Aw, come on!
- Get out.
- Aw, man!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but, uh,
I want you to know.
You see, uh,
I'm a virgin, and, uh...
Well, me, Kevin, Jim and Finch were...
We all made this pact... that we would lose our virginity... before high school was over, and tonight is supposed to be the night that we all do it.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
No, that's... That's not what I mean.
W - What I mean is, uh... Look, do you know what made me leave that game?
See, Coach, he was givin' us this speech about... not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score...
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, you see...
You see, Heather, what I realized is that... with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal... looking for the best way to score.
This may sound a little corny, but... I feel like I've already won.
And, uh, I care about you a lot.
Oz, I know.
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.
It's what your friends call you.
I mean, I feel like I'm one of your friends now.
And... your girlfriend?
♪ Ain't never thought that I could love like this ♪
♪ This feeling inside me is growing ♪
♪ I never thought that you would care ♪
Are ya lost?
You're Stifler's mom.
No, no, not lost.
Just, um, you know, taking the tour.
Hey, uh, thank you for letting us have this wonderful party.
As if there was an alternative in the matter.
So, you enjoying yourself?
I'm... three sheets to the wind, ma'am.
I'm so happy for you.
But it takes the edge off, doesn't it?
- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. It was... It was a bathroom incident.
- Pardon me?
- Never mind.
You have anything to drink?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
That is what the cretins drink.
I'm talking about alcohol, liquor.
- The good stuff.
- All right.
I got some scotch.
- Single malt?
- Aged 18 years.
The way I like it.
Why don't you go grab a glass from the bar?
I think I should.
Allow me.
You know it's a bitchin' party.
The Stif-man always comes through in the clutch.
And then he just puked his brains out.
- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.
Do you want to hear a nasty story of mine?
It's sort of sexual.
Yeah! Yeah, let's hear it.
Okay, well, this one time at band camp, we were playing this game.
I don't know if you know it, but it's called "Spin the Bottle."
And I had to kiss this guy named Mark Wander on the lips.
And-And he plays trombone...
So how do you want to be?
Like... how do you want to do it?
I don't know.
How do you?
Like... normal style.
The missionary position.
Okay.
Kev?
- I wanna hear you say it.
Okay.
Victoria,
I love you.
I love you.

So the end of the story is you... had to kiss the guy for 20 seconds.
And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...
- but I didn't care because it was so funny.
- I get it.
And this one time at band camp, I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Excuse me?
What? You don't think I know how to get myself off?
Hell, that's what half of band camp is... Sex Ed.
So are we gonna screw soon, 'cause I'm gettin' kinda antsy.
This'll do. Whoo-hoo!
Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.
Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.
I don't want you coming so damn early this time.
What makes you think that I would come early?
Come on.
I saw you on the 'Net.
Why do you think I accepted this date?
You're a sure thing.
Yes, I am.
So I said, "This is very obviously a Piero della Francesca."
So, uh, would you object if I said that you were quite striking?
Mr. Finch, are you trying to seduce me?
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

Okay, let's go.
What's my name?
Say my name, bitch!
Michelle, Michelle.
Oh, God.
That was a great night, huh?
Yeah.
I mean, I just can't believe we had our senior prom.
I know.
It went by so fast.
Yeah, it did.
Kevin?
Next year with you going to Ann Arbor... and me going to Ithaca, it's not gonna work, is it?
Don't say that.
I mean, we could make it work.
- It'll be perfect.
- No, Kevin.
- See, that's what I've been realizing... is that...
And you can't plan everything.
Well, I guess... you will be pretty far away. And we'll be on our own, meeting new people.
Last night, though.
I wasn't lying.
I know.
She's gone.
Wha...
Oh, my God.
I was used.
I was used.
Cool!
What's this door locked...
Mom, where's...
- Mom?
Shit-brick?
- Hey, Stifler.
I just gotta say that women, like a fine wine, only get better with age.
Of course, I have no basis for comparison, but, uh, it was good.
So you almost made it, huh, Oz?
- I'll just say that we had a great night together.
- Hang in there, buddy.
- You'll get there.
- You know, guys, I think we're falling in love.
That's great, man.
That's awesome.
- You know what the coolest thing is, guys?
This.
You know, right now.
I mean, after this, everything's gonna be different.
After... getting laid?
- After high school.
- Here's to the next step.
- To the next step. - To the next step.
- To the next step.

The night started out with a bang.
A gunshot to the chest on a drug deal gone bad.
All the elements were in place for a long weekend... heat, humidity, moonlight.
I was good at my job.
There were periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me.
But in the last year, I started to lose that control.
Things had turned bad.
I hadn't saved anyone in months.
I just needed a few slow nights, followed by a couple of days off.
- Ladder Four.
- We're there.
Respond to a 10-22.
Four-flight residential. 417 West 32.
77-David at 177 West 24.
There's a woman who says a roach crawled in her ear. Can't get it out.
Says she's going into cardiac arrest.
63-Boy, men's room, Grand Central.
Man set his pants on fire. - Bad burns.
- Move back.
- Which apartment?
- 5-A.
- Oh, Jesus, it's Mr. Burke.
Why is it always the top floor?
Goddam.
Shh, shh. Over there.
Mary, it's two hands. It's my dad.
We were just watching TV, and he was sort of punching his chest... - Step outside.
- Next thing, he locks himself in the bathroom. So I told him I was gonna call you guys, and he said not to.
- How long ago did he stop breathing?
- I don't know. Ten minutes. Twenty.
A woman on the phone tried to tell us how to do C.P.R.
- Could you do something?
- We'll do what we can.
He was cryin'. I never heard him cryin' before.
I need you to squeeze this once every three seconds.
Clear!
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
Please don't.
- Ma'am, step back.
In the last year, I'd come to believe in such things... as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back. Spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them.
I understood how crazy it was to think this way.
But I was convinced that if I turned around, I'd see old man Burke... standing at the window, watching, waiting for us to finish.
I'll take over.
Call E.R. and ask for an 83.
Sorry.
Do you have any music?
- Music.
I think it helps if you play something he liked.
John.
Play the Sinatra.
- Play the Sinatra.
What is it, Johnny?
Okay, Frank, you can call it. 83.
- No, we can't.
He's got a pulse.
Is he gonna be all right?
His heart's beating.
Have 'em bring up a board.
Help your family. Ride with your mother and brother.
Help your family. They need you more. Help yourself.
For the family.
I had to concentrate to keep my mind from wandering off... on these short trips.
It was the neighborhood I grew up in... and where I'd worked most as a paramedic.
And it held more ghosts per square foot than any other.
Hey, partner. Your man doesn't look well.
They not gonna appreciate you inside.
- Nobody loves me, Griss.
- Hey, Griss just tellin' you things are backing up.
Griss, let us in.
Whatever you say.
Oh, my foot!
Don't even slow down.
Just keep on moving.
Sir, you say you've been snorting cocaine for three days... and now you feel as if your heart is beating too fast... and you would like for us to help you.
To tell you the truth, I don't see why we should.
Correct me if I am wrong here, if I'm mistaken.
Did we sell you the cocaine? Did we push it up your nose?
- For Christ sakes, can I please get a cup of water?
- Shut up, goddam civilian!
- All I want is a cup of water!
No, no, no, no, no, guys.
We're on diversion here. We're not accepting any more patients.
The dispatcher should've let you know that, Frank.
I cannot do it. No. We picked him up at 49th and 10th.
Where do you want me to put him? You tell me.
He wanted to come here. He said that the nurses at Misery were the best.
- All right, fine.
I'll kick someone out of bed three.
Excuse me. You're a kind man, I can see that.
A man like you's not gonna deny a poor, sick, dying, helpless man... - a small cup of water.
- I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Will you shut the fuck up?
Goddam it. What the hell are you doing to me?
We're all backed up in here.
Jesus Christ, look at this guy. Looks like he needs the works.
What's wrong with him?
- You should know.
You pronounced him. - You told me he was dead.
- Flatline. - He got better.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone. Yeah.
Better, huh?
They're fixed and dilated.
This guy's plant food.
Hey, we stole a stretcher from X ray, so put him in three next to the overdose.
All right, look. He's our lowest priority now.
He shouldn't even be here.
All this technology. What a waste.
The doc'll be out in a minute.
- Sir, is there some way we could find out what's going on?
Please, folks, step back.
I've already told you two to step back. - Mister...
- Now, look, don't make me take off my sunglasses.
First-time heart attack, age 45. He should've gone to C.C.U. ten hours ago.
We got three bodies up there just like the one you brought in.
Over there, two AIDS patients.
One is 12 and filling up with fluids.
Mother won't sign the "Do Not Resuscitate." Mercy killing doesn't translate well in Spanish.
It's a sin to have to tube that kid.
We got three more O.D.s from this new killerjunk they're calling Red Death.
What's in it?
It's a mix of heroin and I don't know what else. An amino acid, maybe.
This stuff is so strong, they're drinking it with grain alcohol.
You need ten times the usual amount of Narcan.
And when they wake up, watch out 'cause they're liable to go nuts on you.
- He one of 'em?
- No, that's Noel. He used to be a regular off and on.
I haven't seen him for a while.
He seized and almost coded. I gave him a hypertonic solution.
He drank so much his kidneys were taking out salt.
- That's one for the textbooks.
- Doc, you're the greatest. - You gotta help me.
- Can you give this guy a drink of water?
Noel, I am helping you. You drink any more water, you could die!
Hazmat, three's coding.
Start C.P.R. Milagros, get me an epi.
Odette, wake up Dr. Starks.
Tell him we're gonna need him stat. 400 joules.
You want water? I'll give you water. - What a pain in the ass.
Just get out of here. - 600 joules.
- So you get drunk every day and you fall down.
Well, why should we help you? You're just gonna get drunk tomorrow, fall down again.
Griss, this man wants to leave.
- I know him.
That's Noel.
You better step outside.
It's... It's me.
It's Mary Burke from 49th Street.
Oh, Mary, I'm so thirsty.
They won't give me any water to drink in there.
- Please. - I'll get you some.
I wouldn't do that.
The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
He's had a rough life.
He grew up on our street.
He's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse... for not giving somebody a lousy cup of water.
My father's dying, Noel.
Chinese closes in five minutes.
Beef lo mein.
Been on my mind since I awoke. What do you think?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth, we'll get a run.
Turn here.
You missed it. Chink's on 11th.
Oh, finally. Where you been?
Hey, ambulance man, what you looking at?
Yeah, pretty soon you'll be coming for me.
Do you think he'll come for me?
Pretty soon you'll be coming for me.
Boy, some partner you are, Frank.
I could've walked there faster. I'm starving, and you stop to talk to hookers.
You're making me nuts.
Is that what you're trying to do?
I just remembered.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night.
I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost 2:00.
What the hell am I gonna do?
What are you getting?
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat.
Larry, I eat.
Just haven't had coffee yet.
Only coffee and whisky.
Lucky you ain't dead with that diet.
I got it.
Half fried chicken and fries.
Let's go.
Rose's ghost was getting closer.
It had been six months since I lost her.
A homeless girl, asthmatic, 18 years old.
I used to block the bad calls out. I used to forget, but she wouldn't let go.
And now she'd come to bear witness for all of them, all that had been lost.
These spirits were part of the job.
It was impossible to pass a building that didn't hold a ghost of something.
The eyes of a corpse.
The screams of a loved one.
All bodies leave their mark.
You cannot be near the newly dead without feeling it.
I could handle that.
What haunted me now was more savage.
Spirits born half-finished.
Homicides. Suicides. Overdoses.
Accusing me of being there, witnessing a humiliation, which they could never forgive.
Turn it off.
- What?
- You know what.
The radio.
That's not the police band. It's your fire department scanner in your bag.
Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22.
Six-flight residential. 534 West 32.
- Let's do it.
It might be a good one.
- There are no good fires.
People die in fires.
People get burned up in fires.
People can't breathe.
That's what we're here for.
Let's go.
- Don't push it, Larry.
- Oh, you're burned out, man. You're scorched.
- Not yet, Larry. I'm still burning.
If you get any closer, I'm gonna put a burn on you.
6-3 Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.
Zebra three, I need you.
- You see? He's giving it to us anyway. - Zebra, are you there?
- I'm holding an unconscious at 9th and 41st.
3:00 in the morning. That can only mean one thing.
- Mr. Oh.
I'm not answering it.
Answer the radio, Zebra. You know it's that time. Four times this week I've had him.
Aren't there any other units out there?
- Zebra, are you there? - Don't answer it.
They'll get somebody else.
63-Zebra, answer me now, or I'm sending a captain to your location.
Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. You could do me that favor.
- Yes, Zebra, you'll be driving... to the man who needs no introduction.
Chronic caller of the year, three straight and shooting for number four, the duke of drunk, the king of stink,
- our most frequent flyer, Mr. Oh. - 10-4.
Not this time...
Relax. It's a street job.
It's easy except for the smell.
We just throw him in the back, zip over to Mercy. No blood, no dying. That's how I look at it.
He's just a drunk.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Yeah, but they're just gonna keep calling.
Someone's gonna have a cardiac, and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
He ain't eaten nothing all day.
And he's seizing and throwing up.
- So, what's different about him today?
- He says his feet hurt.
- Oh, why didn't you say so?
- I can't find a pulse, but he's still breathing.
Well, it looks like we're just in time.
Step aside, sir.
- He's drunk.
- He's sick.
You gotta help him.
He's fine. He can walk to the hospital.
Walk?
Are you crazy? He's in the wheelchair.
Oh, don't give me that.
He walks better than I do.
That's right, Mr. Oh.
Your limo's here.
- Good luck, old buddy.
- Faster!
Come on, Frank. Faster!
- Faster? You want faster?
Oh, no. Take that stinky-ass motherfucking bug-ridden skell out of my face!
Johnny, welcome back.
Good to see ya.
And my conscience simply will not allow that.
Griss, this gentleman would like to leave.
He looks so pale.
Hey, you getting enough to eat?
You getting your fiber?
Wasted.
That's my diagnosis. He's shit-faced.
He just needs a bath and some food.
Let's take him in back.
- Get a stretcher. - She's nuts.
That's why he comes here.
- She encourages him.
- Don't you dare. This is not a homeless shelter.
- He's gonna have to wait in the lobby.
- No way, man. Not even in the corner.
Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.
My first cigarette in over a year.
First is always the best.
The doctor doesn't think my father will make it.
Said he was dead for too long.
After six minutes, the brain starts to die, and after that, just close the door.
You never know.
You know, my father and I haven't spoken in three years.
When my brother called me and said that my father had a heart attack... and that he locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over there, I was thinking of... how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was.
When I got there and we put him up on the bed, and I thought of all the other things that I wanted to say to him...
Well, right now I'm more worried about my mother than anything.
Go home.
Take her home.
Get some rest.
- You're not gonna find anything out now.
- That's what I told her.
If she could just see him for a second, then I know she'd let me take her home.
Thanks for the light.
Here's your dinner.
I wheel, you heal.
6-2 David, at 38th and 2, you'll find a three-car accident.
Two taxis and a taxi.
6- 2 Henry, 6-2 Henry. 487 West 22.
Report of a very bad smell.
No further information.
Larry, swing over to 10th. We're gonna have to run one of these calls.
Relax, will ya?
The biggest problem with not driving... is that whenever there's a patient in the back, you're also in the back.
The door's closed.
You're trapped.
5:00 or 6:00 in the morning is always the worst time for me. Just before dawn. Just when you've been lulled into thinking... it might be safe to close your eyes for one minute.
That's when I first found Rose.
She was on the sidewalk, not breathing.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry.
Let's say we go back to the hospital, call it a night.
You got no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Take me back. Put me to bed.
I surrender.
We've done enough damage tonight.
You take things way too seriously, Frank.
You ever think of doing anything else?
Sure.
Taking my captain's exam next year.
Once the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office.
I thought, "What the hell? I'll start my own medic service."
Out on the island, the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal.
It's just a matter of time and who you know.
Someday it's gonna be Chief Larry calling the shots.
I'd always had nightmares. But now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep.
I drank every day.
"Help others and you help yourself."
That was my motto.
But I hadn't saved anyone in months.
It seemed all my patients were dying on me.
I'd waited, sure the sickness would break.
Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow, the feeling would drop away.
More than anything else, I wanted to sleep like that.
Close my eyes and drift away.
Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.
Zebra, answer the radio.
Come on. I got one for you.
Pick up the radio and push the button on the side and speak into the front.
- Suicidal male bleeding, corner of 44th and 8th.
No further information.
10-4.
We have a call, Chief.
Somebody's bleeding. 44th and 8th.
Brake! Brake!
It's the water.
Turn around.
Come on. Kill me!
Push it in!
Do it!
Kill me! Huh?
Kill me. Just push it.
Huh?
I'm gonna cut my throat, man.
No, don't!
Drop the bottle.
- Put down the bottle.
- He's crazy. Really?
You look pretty thirsty, Noel.
You want some water?
See, I can't do it.
I came out of the desert.
Those people left me in the sun to die.
You came out of the hospital.
You were tied down and hallucinating.
You got some bad chemicals in your head.
- There's some medicine at the hospital that'll fix that.
- No! No medicine. - No medicine.
- He got ya. - Do it!
Man wants to die?
I know how to kill that mother.
Larry, call for backup.
6-3 Zebra, 10-85 forthwith, 44 and 8th.
Get out of the road, you crazy bastard!
Noel, you didn't let me finish.
We have rules against killing people on the street, okay? It looks bad.
There's a special room at the hospital for terminating.
It's a nice quiet room with a big bed.
- You mean that?
Man, thank you, man.
Wait a minute. How?
How are you gonna kill me?
Well, you have a choice.
You can have pills, injection or gas.
- Pills. Definitely pills.
- You fucking arsehole!
Tom Wolls, that crazy motherfucker.
- He used to be my partner.
This the guy you called about?
I know you.
- Nah, you don't know me.
You don't know me.
- Oh, yes, I do, Pedro.
I do. - I know you.
I know him.
- I don't think so.
You give my friend here any more trouble, I'll kill ya.
- Yeah, at the hospital.
At the hospital. He's gonna kill me in the hospital.
Forget the hospital. I'll kill you here.
This looks like a very bad man I took in a couple of weeks ago... who'd been holding two priests...
not one, two priests... hostage with a screwdriver, and I told him... if he was ever caught making trouble again, - I'd kick the murdering life out of him. - It's not worth it, Tom.
- He's surrendering.
- What?
- The war's over.
- Not mine.
Hey, Pedro, come here, you little motherfucker.
I just want to talk to you, give you a little psychological first aid.
I'm gonna give you your first lesson on how to be an American.
It's called "Eatin' My Shit."
Tom, don't do it, Tom.
I have to take him to the hospital.
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- That's enough! - Take that!
There's a double shooting three blocks down. 41st and 8th, confirmed.
We'll do that. Larry. Larry.
- That's enough.
I'll do that.
I'll see you over there, okay?
What happened?
Just walked up and shot him. Not a word.
- Damn, that was cold.
- E.M.S. Move it.
Where are you hit?
You see this shit, man?
Niggas put a hole in me.
Yo, Tiger did this shit, yo.
And money right here work for Outlaw.
- We got a gang war about to start, yo.
- Take a deep breath.
Major Tom!
I'm going to Misery!
You take yours to Bellevue.
Okay, Frank, you take yours to heaven.
I'll take mine to hell.
Get him on the board.
You're gonna feel a stick in your arm.
Don't move.
Listen, I'm quitting, man.
I'm going in the army where it's safe.
I don't wanna die.
- No, I wanna die. I'm the one.
- You're not gonna die.
- What did you say?
- Shut up! You're going to die. He's not.
Got it?
- Hold my hand, man. - I can't.
I gotta do the other arm.
- Hold my hand, man.
- Hold this.
If you let go, I swear I won't kill you.
It's all right.
We're here.
He's not breathing. Call a code.
Noel, let's go.
So here I am. And this junkie got something jammed in his teeth.
Now, none of these junkies wanna give mouth-to-mouth.
It was a blow dryer.
So I pulls it out.
His body was cold except for his throat.
It had been blow-dried for an hour.
Junkie had second-degree burns of the tongue.
Did you ever give mouth-to-mouth?
A long time ago, when I was your age, boy. Never again.
Chances are you end up with a mouthful of puke. Junkie puke.
I'd do it if I had to. It's part of the job.
- What about you?
You ever do mouth-to-mouth before?
- Once. On a baby.
Now, babies are a whole different thing entirely.
Did I ever tell you about the time that white woman approached me?
I said, "Ma'am, I'm a true cocksman, and I don't mix my seed. "
Only time you see me with a white woman when I'm holdin' her for the police. " That's the truth.
You shouldn't smoke.
It's okay. They're prescription.
Works better with a little whisky.
Yeah, that was my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.
That's it!
I've had it!
Can't take it anymore.
- You got... blood on...
- I know.
That boy you brought in, he's, uh, shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
- Our Lady of Misery. - It's crazy in there.
What's the matter with that doctor... who keeps mumbling and poking himself in the eye whenever he talks to me?
He's working a double shift.
Well, my father's in there. He's in a coma.
My mother, she's... she's going crazy.
It's like, uh, she's in a trance.
She should go home.
Yeah, well, I'd take her, but somebody's got to stay here.
- Did you see him?
- It wasn't him.
You saw him?
They showed me someone. It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband.
Mrs. Burke, they'll take care of him.
You should go home now.
I should know my own husband.
They wouldn't let me see him.
Larry and I'll drop her home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.
Mom, they're gonna give you a ride home.
Come on. This way.
You want some coffee?
I have applesauce cake too.
- Right here.
I'll call you if anything changes.
Saving someone's life is like falling in love.
The best drug in the world.
For days, sometimes weeks afterwards, you walk the street making infinite whatever you see.
Once, for a few weeks, I couldn't feel the earth.
Everything I touched became lighter.
Horns played in my shoes.
Flowers fell from my pockets.
You wonder if you've become immortal, as if you've saved your own life as well.
God has passed through you.
Why deny it that for a moment there...
Why deny for a moment there God was you?
Taking credit when things go right doesn't work the other way.
When things go wrong, spreading the blame is an essential medic survival tool.
"The elevator broke down." "The boyfriend was crazy."
"I should've called in sick." "The tube wouldn't go in."
The god of hellfire is not a role that anyone wants to play.
- Good morning, Captain.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?
Pierce, I just got off the phone with Borough Command.
Out of 12 shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four.
That includes the shift where you came in late, you went home early.
- I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you. - You're sick?
You're killing me, do you know that?
You've got no sick time left according to Command.
I mean, I was told to terminate.
I'll just get my things out of my locker.
Excuse me. It's not okay.
I-I never fired anybody in my life, man.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Don't take it too hard.
Nobody tells me to fire anybody, ever.
I told them, "Stick it right up your big one." Pardon me.
I said, "You wanna fire him? Come on over and do it yourself."
You know they won't do it. It's up to you.
You've gotta be strong. - Be a man. - I am a man.
You think they give these to sissies?
Come on, kid. This is a weekend of full moons.
Nobody wants to work.
I mean, your partner Larry's called in sick.
Okay, Larry Veeber. Stupid Stanley too.
Come on. I need bodies out there.
I got buses that gotta run.
I had to put Marcus on 62-Young. Hey. Hey.
You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row. - You swore you'd fire me... if I came in late again.
- I'll fire you tomorrow.
Even better than that, what was I thinking about?
I could forward you some sick time.
How about a week?
A week's not gonna do it.
- Kid, you're saying no, it ain't gonna do it.
You're going out with Marcus.
Duty calls you, kid. The city needs you. Please.
I'll front you sick time. I'll make it up to you. Honest to God.
Look at me.
The next time I see you, I'll fire you.
- I can bark too. - Pierce, you can do it all.
I never said I could bark better than you.
Go and help... Go and help the people of New York. Go ahead.
Get out there and mop them up for me. Go ahead.
Do your job. - Do your job.
You're the best.
- Put down that crack stem.
Put down that crack stem and drop your jug of sin, your high-heeled skirts and your stock dividends, your patent leather underwear, televised suicides, lap dancers in leotards in delicatessens.
And the Lord said, "If you can find one that isn't a sinner... just one...
- then I will spare the city. " - My Lord, Mother of Man.
Boy, you look like hell.
What you drinking?
Captain almost fired me tonight.
I'm on my way out.
Anytime now.
Nobody gets fired, son.
Look at me.
The most they might do is transfer you to the Bronx.
Boy, you look like you aged about ten years since I rode with you last.
I ain't feeling so hot.
I've been seeing the ghosts.
- You mean the people we lost?
If they got to go, got to go.
God bless 'em.
You ever notice people who see shit are always crazy?
Scientific fact.
- I think the worst is over. - Oh, no, son.
It can always get worse.
See, you can't change what's out there.
Only where you're coming from.
Thank you, Jesus... take over in here.
6-2 Young.
Let's go, 6-2 Young. Answer the radio.
Marcus, it's Love.
I haven't heard her in months.
Well, no, she only works when I'm on.
I makes her wait.
Drives her crazy.
- It is true you and Love went on a blind date? - Mm-hmm.
- She hit you with a bottle?
- Why you gotta bring that up?
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
6-2 Young, I don't have time for your games.
Now, answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Oh, sookie, sookie. now. Rough.
Now, see, I usually don't do calls before my coffee, but I think this'll be good for you, son.
6-2 Young is here, baby.
And I'm gonna take care of you.
Come on, white boy.
'Cause Big Daddy Marcus is alive and on arrival, baby.
I'm not your baby, Young. I'm not your mother either.
You're going to a cardiac arrest. 30th and 11th, north-east corner.
It's a club.
All right, 10-4, sweet mama.
You feeling better, Frank?
- I feel worse.
- Oh, that's good, boy.
This here is for you.
I hope we're not too late from you folks holding us up here. Excuse me.
Right this way.
Get the hell out of my way.
Okay, what happened?
- Please tell me he's gonna be all right.
- You buggin'. We just signed our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.
Ain't nothing we can do about it.
Come on, Frank. That's it.
- What do you mean he's dead?
- He's not dead.
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop bullshitting me and tell it straight.
Then, the good Lord willing, we'll try and bring him back.
He broke up with his old lady.
- We didn't break up.
We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.
- Shut up, arsehole! Nobody asked you!
- Was I talking to you?
Dick, shut up!
I'm still waiting and this young man here is still dead.
- You wanna leave here in a body bag too?
- You'll end up like him, dick!
- Shut up!
- He's been snorting that Red Death stuff.
It's been going on for, like, four days now.
I rebuke the spirit of drugs in the name of Jesus.
What's his name?
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What you mean I.B. Bangin'?
- What the hell kind of name is I.B. Bangin'? - I don't know his real name.
- It's Frederick Smith.
- Okay, Freddy...
- It's Frederick.
Okay, I.B. Bangin', we're gonna bring you back from the dead.
Now, I want everybody here to grab the hand of the person next to you.
Come on now. We ain't got much time.
And look up towards the heavens.
Dear Lord, here I am again... asking one more chance for a sinner.
Please, Lord, bring back I.B. Bangin', Lord.
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.
You have the super light to spare this worthless man.
- Rise up, I.B. Bangin'... and start your life anew!
Oh, thank You, Lord.
- What happened? - You fucking died, you stupid bastard.
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.
- Not us.
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest.
He's gone.
Burke?
You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube. He had to be sedated.
He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I.C.U.
- What do you think?
- Who knows? It's all lower brain stem activity at this point.
The heart refuses to stabilize.
You know, he coded 11 times since he got here.
But the guy's a fighter.
Every time the Valium wears off, he starts yanking on the restraints.
The family know?
I wanted to bring them in to see if he'd respond to voices.
But there was no one in the waiting room.
This guy's daughter was in my face all night. Finally, I got something positive to tell her, she's gone.
You put poison in your veins, and now that you're breathing again, you can't wait to say "Thank you very much" and get back out to poison shopping.
Well, since we saved your life, could you do us a favor... and stop breathing in another city next time?
I ever tell you about that time years ago... I was on this ledge uptown trying to pull this damn psycho inside?
You mean where the guy jumped and you almost fell?
No, you never told me that story.
No, you never listened.
There I was. I put everything I had into saving this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal... that when he went down, it was like I wanted to go with him.
That happened once in Ireland.
This girl jumped off the cliffs of Moher and the wind blew her back up.
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.
The wind, my black ass.
That was Jesus.
Don't tell me about the Good Book.
I'll preach heaven and beat the hell out of you. Don't tell me that now.
I was going, son.
But if someone up on high... Thank You, Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...
Would you turn left here?
I wanna make a stop.
The point is, everybody go through a stretch where folks gonna die on you.
Just don't meditate on it.
I'll be right back.
It's Frank Pierce from the ambulance last night.
I brought your father into the hospital.
- I just learned some news.
- I'll be right down.
He's better, isn't he?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement.
I mean, it's still early. It might mean nothing, but I thought you'd wanna know.
I sensed it when I heard your voice.
You-You look so different.
It's awful, isn't it?
It's like Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
No, I think it looks good.
Ah, I was going nuts in that waiting room.
I came back to check on my mom.
- How is she?
- She's sleeping.
I was just gonna get some food. Pizza.
I thought maybe we...
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.
He hasn't talked to me in three years.
But it's okay. Sometimes you just have to put things behind you.
I gotta be getting back.
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.
Who that?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night.
I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery.
Her father's showing signs of improving.
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.
- I'm hungry too. We gotta get something to eat after this.
- God, help us. He's hungry.
Can you hear me?
It's Mary.
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me, Dad.
He squeezed my hand.
He's moving, Doctor.
He grabbed my hand.
Come on, Dad. Show 'em.
See? See? I'll be damned.
It's movement.
Just not sure how voluntary it is.
No, he heard me.
Come on, Dad.
Nurse Crupp.
Ten milligrams of Valium!
Get over here.
- Where's that Valium?
- Why don't we step out for a little while, - wait till this passes.
- Make sure he's breathing.
He wants to pull that tube out.
It's pretty painful.
That's why they keep him sedated.
- But it's a good sign.
- Are you sure?
I know my father would hate being tied down.
He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
That's how it's done.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and the heart... recover enough to go on their own.
He's better though, right?
He's better.
I'm sorry. It's just...
It's important to me. I mean, a week ago...
I was wishing he was dead.
And now, I wanna hear his voice just once more.
You know what I mean?
Went over to Ray's and got this.
Must be a place reserved in hell for somebody who charges $1.50 a slice.
Anything comes up, I'll call you.
I'm not really hungry.
You know, my father's a really wonderful man.
There was nobody he wouldn't help.
You know that crazy guy, Noel, who I gave water to last night? He lived at our house for almost a year.
Total stranger he'd do anything for.
His own family, though...
It's best not to... dwell.
It's good pizza, huh?
Mmm, it's not as good as, uh, Nino's.
You remember that pizza place, Mimi's, on 10th, maybe 15 years ago?
When you ordered a pie, it came with a little plastic Madonna in the middle.
Saint Anthony, yeah.
You from the neighborhood?
- I grew up on 43rd.
I went to Holy Cross.
- Really? I went to Sacred Heart.
Where'd you go to high school?
Well, you know, Mary, we moved out after that. Upstate.
Like everybody else, except us.
- So, your parents...
Good. - They're fine.
My old man's a bus driver, and Mom a nurse.
Sort of born to it, I guess.
- You married?
I was.
Hard to explain.
She had a hard time adjusting to, uh...
Well, maybe-maybe it was my fault too.
White cocksucker!
Is it always this bad in here?
How does anybody survive? - Gosh.
- Well, it's been bad lately, but it's-it's always bad.
How long have you been doing this?
Five years.
Wow. You must've seen some things, huh?
Well, no.
I mean, you sort of learn to block it out, you know?
It's like, um... like cops fencing off a crime scene.
But then, something good'll happen. Everything just glows.
You must get a lot of overdoses.
Bet you picked me up a couple times.
I think I'd remember that.
Maybe not.
I was a different person then.
Does everyone you meet just... - spill their guts on you like this?
- Uh, mostly.
Must be my face.
My mother always said I look like a priest.
You do.
Yeah, my mom thought I was gonna be a nun... because, uh, I ran away to a convent when I was 13.
But I didn't want to be a nun.
I just... I wanted to run away.
Well, Sister Mary or Mary the Junkie, it didn't really matter to me.
- You know, I better go check on my father. - Yeah, all right.
Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one.
Maybe, um, when he gets better.
- When we're through with all of this.
Look after her, Griss, okay?
Rule number one:
Don't get involved with patients.
Rule number two:
Don't get involved with patients' daughters. - You understand?
What about rule number three?
Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Now, boy, you don't know nothin' about rule number three.
Cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule.
Let's go look at some hookers, hmm?
Kit Kat Club be lettin' out 'bout now.
74-Will. 330, West 33rd.
Church of Jesus Son, for demonic possession.
72-Victor, you're goin' to 8th and 14th.
On the corner, there's a 40-year-old man hearing' celebrity voices.
76-X ray, take it uptown, 541 West 54th St, for the elderly woman abducted by her cat.
Look at these women.
Can't even tell who's a hooker no more.
Whatever happened to go-go boots and hot pants? They'll wear anything now.
Walk out the house with whatever they got on.
The street's not like the E.R.
There's no walls, no controls.
To make up for that, they try to teach me how to act without thinking, like a soldier who can take apart and reassemble a gun blindfolded.
Kick his ass! Fuck him up! Fuck him up!
Kick his ass!
Beat the shit out of him, baby!
Beat the shit out of him! I realized that my training was useful... in less than ten percent of the calls, and saving someone's life was rarer than that.
After a while, I grew to understand... that my role was less about saving lives than about bearing witness.
I was a grief mop.
It was enough that I simply showed up.
Except with Rose.
Shut up!
- I'll get ya a glass of water.
Noel, I'm your friend.
Come on, calm down.
I'm gonna take you to a spa.
I'm gonna get you a facial. Shh, shh.
Look-Look-Look at that.
Leaves you with no idea what's underneath. Not even a suggestion.
Could be a skeleton for all you know.
Yeah, that-that's nice, though. Right there.
Mm-hmm.
Pullin' back her hood as we drive by.
See, there's a mystery to it.
- Then she shows ya.
- She's not a whore, Marcus.
We're all whores, Frank.
You know what I'm talkin' about?
The way she looked at me.
She wasn't lookin' at you, man. She was lookin' at me.
Why did you kill me, Frank?
- I didn't kill you. - No, you didn't, Frank, and thank you.
But there's still a couple hours left on our shift.
- No, it's not you. It's some...
- You hearing' them voices again?
- I just need a drink.
- What-What them voices sayin' to ya?
They say, "Kill Marcus!" Okay?
That ain't funny, Frank.
Look, I don't need shock treatments. I'm not sick, all right?
- I just need a drink. - Okay.
62-Young, answer the radio.
I have a call for you.
I can't wait all night, Young.
I'm holdin' a priority, and if you don't answer I'm gonna knock you outta service.
62-Young is here, baby, and I'm gonna help you out.
Just remember, you owe me.
You're going to 370 West 98th Street.
17-year-old female, cardiac arrest.
No further information.
- 10-4, hon.
- Why is everything a cardiac arrest?
What happened to chest pain, difficulty breathing, fractured hands?
Come on, people!
Lord Jesus, help me get through the night.
I hate this block. Nothin' but crackheads.
- I don't wanna go in there without the police.
- I'm goin'. It's easier than waitin'.
E.M.S!
- Ambulance!
- Oh, Jesus. My bad back.
My feet hurt.
Damn crackheads. - E.M.S!
Please, hurry.
Please hurry. Come this way, please.
- She's over here.
My, oh, my, a fat crackhead!
Now, that's a first.
- What's wrong?
- No English.
She has terrible pain in her belly.
- I mean, she's pregnant.
- No, no, that's impossible.
We're virgins.
Are you pregnant? ¿Estas embarazada?
Can you walk?
- She say she in great pain.
- Thank-Thank you. Thank you for the translation.
What's your name?
All right, let's have a look.
You two know each other a long time?
Yeah, two years, ever since we left the island.
This is a personal question, but I gotta ask it. - In all that time, you never had sex?
- No, never.
Maybe you had a couple of beers one night last summer.
You know how it works, son.
- No cigarettes, no drugs, no beer.
- No underwear? - We're virgins!
- Oh, Jesus, we'd better go.
Call for backup!
- It's coming.
Hold her down.
- My God! What the hell is that?
- It's three legs.
- That's too many!
- They're comin'!
- Is she dying?
- She's having a baby. Twins.
- That's imposible. It's possible!
It's possible!
She's having a baby, okay?
It's a miracle.
Contractions stopped.
Help me get her out of here.
- All right, look, let's just put her down.
Put her over here.
Let's just put her down.
You take the first one.
It's a boy, Frank.
He looks good.
How's yours?
Open the door!
She had a pulse!
Code!
Code blue!
Get her on the monitor.
- Where's the pediatric cart?
How many months, Frank? - Can't tell.
- It was a breech.
Twins.
The other seems okay. - Step back, Frank.
Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
I'm a mother!
I got a daughter!
I got rights!
- Give her some Valium!
- Ten mil, stat!
- Flatline.
Let's start C.P.R.
- Starting.
- Status?
I think I got a pulse.
- Fuck! - Nothing!
- Give me an I.V. line.
- Call X ray.
- I.V. 's in. Give me epinephrine.
- How long has she been down?
- About ten minutes.
- Call respiratory.
Can I please bother you for a cup of water? - Can we get an X ray here?
Oh, my God.
- For days, I have eaten nothing but sand, O Lord. - Stop compression. - I've waited so long.
- Can I please get some fucking water?
- Flatline!
Jesus Christ! Who woke that guy up? - Come on.
- I've got nothing.
Are the parents here?
Someone's gonna have to tell 'em.
Don't give me that look.
- What look? - You know what look.
It's all over your face.
That I-Just-Saved- A-Little-Baby-Boy look.
We just saved a little, bouncing' baby boy.
- Think of it that way. - I don't wanna hear about it, okay?
That's three jobs for the night.
It's over. Three jobs.
Time for a drink.
Six A.M.., the cocktail hour.
So, pass the bottle. I know you're holding.
The bar is now open.
I hate gin.
You know, when I had that little baby in my hands, I felt like I was 21 again.
Call like that makes me wanna go back to workin' three nights a week, not two.
- You know, start runnin' again, cut down on my drinkin'.
- I'll drink to that.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
The greatest job in the world.
62-Young, I have priorities holding'.
Pick up the radio.
Don't do it, Marcus.
Please. Tell her the bus died.
Tell her the radio's not working.
Tell her our backs are out.
Tell her... Tell her we're too drunk to take any more calls.
- Let's take it!
62-Young, this is Marcus.
Only for you, baby! Only for you!
- Keep it to yourself, Young.
Male diff breather, approximately 30. West End and 72nd.
10-4, hon.
I'm comin', baby!
Big Daddy Marcus is comin'!
- We comin'! We comin'! - No!
Thank You, Jesus.
- Are you all right?
- Amen. Thank You, Jesus.
Oh, thank You, Lord.
That is the last time you do this to me, Marcus.
- Where are you goin', Frank?
I'm through.
Oh, you think just 'cause you quit, them ghosts gonna quit too?
It don't work that way, Frank!
I've been there, son!
You need the Holy Ghost, Frank!
The Holy Ghost!
- What's going on, Griss?
- Your friend there just untied the water beggar.
Griss was comin' out to thank her.
Probably saved Griss a murder charge.
She's having a tough time, though.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
No, I'm all right.
I can't stand seeing people tied up.
I'm in that waiting' room for hours, and I'm listenin' to Noel screamin'.
And the only reason that's he's screamin' is 'cause he's tied up!
- Don't seem so bad to me.
- Don't say that.
I almost cut my father loose too.
You know, one minute they tell me that he's almost dead.
The next minute, they tell me he's better and I can go in and...
It's killing me seeing him fight like that.
Well, since you're here, maybe, uh, maybe you could do me a favor and, uh... wait for me outside this building, 'cause I gotta go visit a friend who's sick.
I'm only asking you because this is a dangerous building, and there's been some robberies and a woman was raped not long ago, and...
This woman I'm seeing, she's gonna wanna sit and talk with me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and tell her that you're waitin', then she'll let me out quick.
If anything happens, I'm in 16-M.
Maybe I should come up with you.
If I'm not back in 15 minutes just hit the buzzer, and that way she'll let me go.
If that's what's gonna happen. I'll come with you. I'm okay.
I'm just visiting a friend who's sick.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Fifteen minutes.
You know, everyone at that hospital's crazy!
I'm going crazy too.
You understand?
I just have to...
I just have to relax a little and not feel so guilty all the time.
We can still go back.
I'll walk you home.
You sleep for a couple hours. Watch some TV. Take a bath.
Don't be such a cop.
If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
You go on home.
Really.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
I don't need you.
- Hey, Cy, guess who's here.
Can I help you?
Mary Burke.
She's a friend.
She's not here.
Wait a minute. You can't go in.
- Kanita?
- It's all good.
- He looks like a cop.
No, he ain't no cop.
You're a medic, right?
I'm Cy. Cy Coates.
Frank Pierce.
Mary said you might be coming over.
- Where is she?
- Sleepin', brother, in the back.
She asked me to pick her up, go out for a movie and a malt and bring her right home.
I know, I know.
I know. But she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours.
See, it's terrible about her father and everything.
I better just go in and see her.
Frank, see, I call this the Oasis.
It's a refuge from the world out there.
You wanna come in here, relax, sit down.
Brother, she is sound asleep.
She ain't gonna know any difference.
No, I'm gonna go see her.
Well, did you know two people got shot in this building' last week?
A priest got robbed by ten-year-olds across the street.
Oh, brother, be careful.
That's the Tiger.
Lady's down the hall.
Clean up that nose, brother.
Welcome to Dayrise Enterprises, Frank.
Stress-free factory.
We have to get going.
She asked for something to help her sleep, brother.
Mary, we really have to go.
- Whoa, Frank, she suffered enough, all right?
Now, she's gonna be fine. I promise.
Come on, Frank.
Now, I'm always interested in people with stressful occupations.
Now, bein' a paramedic, that's about as stressful as I can imagine.
Go ahead, take a seat. Sit down.
Tell me some war stories.
You know, what's it like?
Got a beer?
Oh, that shit is poison, Frank.
We don't have alcohol around here.
What you need is one of these.
Did-Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Excuse me?
Red Death.
Tell me something, Frank.
Does killing your clients sound like good business sense to you? Hmm?
See, the kids selling' that Red Death are just tryin' to make a quick buck.
They don't got no respect for me or the work I done in this community.
But don't worry.
They're gonna be taken care of.
I got Tiger workin' on it.
- I should be going.
I just quit. - Oh, look.
Sleep is all stress reduction. All right?
Here.
Now, if you take one of these, sleep for two hours...
That's all you need.
Why do you think I'm tellin' you this, Frank?
For my health?
Now, brother, you gotta look at yourself in the mirror, all right?
Would you get our new friend here a glass of water, please?
Oh, you're so fine.
Is this what you gave Mary?
Yep, that's the stuff.
I call it the Red Lion.
It's very king-of-the-jungle, "Makuna matata," all that.
There's no language. Just brute power.
But, see, you just ain't gonna believe how relaxing' that shit really is, all right?
- I guess I'll be going.
- Just relax.
You at the Oasis now.
Take my pulse.
It's good, isn't it?
It's perfect.
It's two beats per minute.
I knew it.
I was wrong about you.
You're not so bad.
- You're in the stomach.
- You sure?
You're in the stomach again.
- You're in the stomach again. Let me try.
- One more time.
- Rose.
My name, Rose.
- Stomach again.
- No way!
No pulse.
Let me try.
No pulse! No pulse, goddam it!
Take it easy!
Okay, what happened?
- He flipped out!
- All right, now, Frank... Frank, be cool, my brother.
- You're havin' what you call a paradoxical reaction.
- He's psycho!
- Listen to me, Frank.
Frank, where are you goin'?
Yeah, you go.
Okay, that's good. You go in there.
You go in there, lie down.
Get some sleep, whatever.
- Cy, you want me to stop this?
- No, Tiger, it's all right.
- You sure? - It's cool. Be cool.
Let him go.
Frank, you are makin' a serious mistake, my man.
She's just gonna come back.
Oh, and Frank, you owe me ten dollars.
Put me down.
Get off!
- Did you and Cy have a nice talk?
Did he tell you about Dayrise Enterprises helping people?
Well, I've seen him hurt people.
Why are you following me?
Because you can barely walk.
You remember Noel from the other night?
He wasn't always like that.
He was my brother's best friend.
Cy or Tiger or one of those goons put a bullet in Noel's head.
He was in a coma for three months.
He's been crazy ever since.
This is... my building.
What is it with you?
You wanna help me?
You feel sorry for me? Well, keep it to yourself.
I just need to sit down for a minute.
You wanna fuck me?
Everyone else has.
I've been clean for two years. No drugs.
I got a job.
I paint when I'm at home.
I don't bother anybody.
Then all this shit happens.
Oh, no, you don't.
Hey, you can't stay here. Come on.
Get up.
I'm Frank.
Mary's friend.
A very close friend who loves animals.
I washed my face with three kinds of soap, each smelling like a different season.
It felt good to be in a woman's room again, especially a woman who wasn't comatose or severely disabled.
I felt like perhaps I had turned a corner... like I saved someone... though I didn't know who.
You're late, I know it, but I can't fire you today.
- I got nobody to ride 66-X ray with Wolls.
I got a form for you to make out about the accident when you get some time.
Come here, kid. Come here.
Look, I'm gonna fire you tomorrow. I promise you.
What-What if there is no tomorrow?
Will you get out of here before I give you a big hug!
"No tomorrow." I love that kid.
What do you know?
You and me again, tonight.
The Rough Riders, tearing' up the streets just like old times, huh?
This old bus is a warrior, Frank. Just like us.
I have tried to kill him...
many times, and he will not die.
I have great respect for that.
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!
- We're full up here tonight, Frank.
Get the hell out of here.
Step back!
Step back!
Go to the bank, boy.
Take out everything you can.
Mr. Burke?
I'm going. I've had enough.
- I can't reach.
You're taller.
- Don't do it!
- He's getting better.
- Better than what?
It doesn't matter! - Better than what? - Why not?
- The family wants us to keep him alive.
The wife wants to believe in miracles. We keep him alive.
Shock him, Frank.
He'll come back.
He always comes back.
- You son of a bitch! - Nothing.
Don't do it!
- Son of a bitch!
- Do it again.
Don't do it!
Jesus! Move!
Where you goin', Frank?
Frank, what the hell you doin' back there?
I'm sick, Tom.
I need a cure.
Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose... and a drop of adrenaline.
It's not as good as beer, but it's all I got.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spillin' in the streets.
Let's go have some fun.
Watch out.
These are hard times, Tom.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
It's great to be drunk.
Sobriety's killing me.
Look up in the sky, Frank.
It's a full moon.
Blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it.
Our mission:
to save lives.
Our mission is coffee, Tom.
A shot of the bull. Puerto Rican espresso.
10-4.
El Toro de Oro.
Blast off!
This cure's not working, Tom.
Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Oh, come on. Don't worry.
Tom will take care of ya.
Put your head out the window. Get some of that nice clean air.
- Come on, stop it!
- Okay, units, it's suicide hour.
14th and 7th. A man with a noose around his neck and nothin' to hang it on.
66-X ray, don't even think about getting coffee.
I have a call for you too.
66-Exterminator here.
We like our coffee bloody.
This better be good.
My partner's dying to help someone.
You're in luck, X. Your patient awaits you with bleeding wrists in the tunnel.
- Tom, where are the Band-Aids?
- This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Look out!
He does this every time he gets drunk.
- You smell that? - But he hates when I call you guys.
What the hell's goin' on here?
You gotta take him to the hospital.
- He tried to kill himself.
- You guys got any coffee?
- Show him your wrist. Go ahead, show him.
- All right, come on.
Let me see.
It's not even bleeding.
He does this all the time.
He ain't right.
It was bleedin' before. He kept spilling his beer. I gave him mouth-to-mouth.
You're lucky you didn't kill him.
I wanna hear it straight from the Looney Tunes himself.
Try to bump yourself off?
Why didn't you say so?
I'm gonna fix you up.
Sir, I am going to give you some medicine that is still very experimental.
It's from NASA.
And although our astronauts have been using it for years, we are the very first service to try it.
Now, I am gonna put this patch on your forehead, like this.
And in about a minute, you will have to relax.
You will lose all your suicidal feelings. It's very important that you wear the patch for at least 24 hours. And keep checking the mirror.
If the patch turns green, you have to see a doctor immediately.
The side effects could be fatal.
- Okay, now, what did I say? What color?
- Uh, clean.
- "Cream." You said "cream." - Cream.
Green. - Green.
This, uh...
Excuse me.
This is the worst suicide attempt I've ever seen.
Can you feel that pulse? Here?
That's where you cut.
And it's not across. It's down, like so.
Here.
Take it.
- I can't.
I can't.
- What?
With all the poor people of this city... who wanted only to live and were viciously murdered, you have the nerve to sit here... wanting to die and not go through with it?
You make me sick!
Take it!
We cured him!
There's nothin' we can't do if we just work together.
I told you to stop for coffee.
Thanks a lot.
It sounds like they're trying to clean up the bus terminal tonight.
Major Tom to Frank.
Time to just say "no."
- Where you goin'?
- Come on, Tom, the city's burning.
What are you doin'?
I'm driving out of myself.
- Uh, these brakes are shot.
- I've taken that into consideration.
Are you okay?
Never felt better in my life.
How are you?
- I'm good. - Good.
66-X ray.
X ray-66.
- First of all, I want you to know how sorry I am about this.
I've always liked you two.
A unit above none.
A legend in its own lunchtime.
So it hurts me deeply to do this, but I have no choice.
You must go to 48th and Broadway.
In front of a liquor store you'll find a 50-year-old male, unconscious.
It says here, "Man smells real bad."
- Do I have to say more? - But you've said too much already.
- Mr. Oh!
- It's early for him.
It's all right.
We're not meant to do Oh tonight.
Something's gonna happen. I can feel it!
Sergeant, put me on the back of that jumper. E.M.S. to Central.
What was that call? - E.M.S., a jumper. A shooting.
West Side Projects.
- 10-4.
One minute out.
Let's go. Somebody's gonna kill themselves.
Let's go. I don't wanna miss it. 66.
66-X ray, level one emergency.
Level one emergency. I need units. I need units.
We got fires in the hole. 8th and Broadway.
Shots being fired outside the Dynamite Club. 13th and 6th.
Fired workers are shooting each other at the post office. Where are my units?
Where are my units? 6- 6?
6-6 X-ray?
Level one emergency!
The dead are rising, but you can't tell their faces from the smoke!
Somebody holding' him or somethin'?
Is he trying to jump?
Go on home, sinners!
Go back to your opium pipes and whisky bottles!
- What's with the rabbis?
- They love to hang around with us.
They offered us money for a new rig, so I deputized them.
Back to your slot machines, ribbed condoms, Mexican divorces, your sex clubs and martinis.
Back to your hot oil wrestling, Washington lobbying, organ donation.
- Better bring it all.
You guys grab all the gear.
Let's go.
- This guy a jumper?
- Got a call for shots fired on the 16th floor.
- The jumper called right after.
- He landed on 14.
I'm goin' to 16.
He must've left the tub on.
That's it. Nobody else home.
Aye, that's gotta hurt.
- Tell him not to move.
- I'm going down to 14.
Forget that thing. Go with the torch.
Hey, get this, Frank. We got two patients.
Number one:
the scarecrow outside. Number two:
the big fellah.
Misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony.
Then he throws himself through the glass window.
Then he starts crawling that way and, uh, he passed out.
- Well, he's our shish kebab for the night then.
- Gonna have to torch him.
- How's he doing? - I don't know.
I'm gonna work on Sleeping Beauty.
Hey, big guy!
Either you jump or you get shot. What are ya gonna do?
I think I'd rather get shot.
Drug dealers.
- Does that hurt?
I don't think you're cut through any major arteries.
We have to get you off this thing without setting off bleeding.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I'll take your blood pressure.
- All right, I'm in. You in?
- I am now.
If he happens to fall, I don't think anybody'd be cryin' too much.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm.
Maybe very warm.
I can't hold my head up anymore.
Hold this.
Let him fuckin' go!
- Let him die! - Let him go!
Am I gonna live?
- You're gonna live.
That ten dollars you owe me? - Yeah? - Keep it.
I've been thinkin' about things, you know?
Oh, you guys gave me lots of time to meditate on the future.
What'd you do, huh? Stop for Chinese on the way over here?
I was tired.
I needed a coffee.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
That's, uh...
That's too bad.
See, Frank, make some money, fine-lookin' lady on your arm, then everybody wants to take a piece.
Yeah, there's some kid... who I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes, comes to the Oasis, starts shooting' at me.
The Red Death Gang.
Bunch of 12-year-olds.
I thought I could make it on the balcony, like Tiger.
But he's fat. Falls faster.
That's why.
I'm tryin' to watch my weight, and look what happens.
Goddam, that's hot!
Bring it on! Bring it on!
You can't kill me, duck-ass kids!
Look at that.
Hey, isn't that beautiful?
Oh, when the fires start to fall, them that's strongest rule it all! Oh!
I love this city!
Good thing we clipped you in, huh, Frank?
What about me?
Who buckled me in? - I thought you did.
- Nah, I thought you did.
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Yeah, right. Aah!
Stop jerking' my pole!
I-I got a fence up my ass, all right? I need something for the pain.
We'll get you another sedative.
And somebody'll be by to take you to the O.R., hopefully sometime this morning.
Hopefully? Hopefully sometime this morning?
Oh, Frank.
You saved my life.
Yeah, I know.
Nurse Crupp, we're gonna need some Valium here.
He's waking up again.
- Where's that Valium?
- Coming.
Frank, give me a hand over here. I gotta get something between his teeth.
- Don't!
Don't do it!
- Valium's in.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Fourteen.
Finally got him a room up in I.C.U. He should be up there in a couple hours.
What are you gonna do, just have somebody follow him around with a defibrillator?
That's a good one, Frank.
No, but we might surgically implant one... around the shoulder over here, 'bout the size of my thumb.
Two electrodes connected to the heart. Sends a shock whenever he needs it.
Or we could just send him home with a defibrillator.
Last night I was weak, and it won't happen again.
All that shit I was sayin' was just 'cause I was stoned.
- Just forget it.
- No problem.
Thanks for letting me crash.
It was the best sleep I've had in months.
I used some of your soap.
Did you see my father?
You know, the doctor said that, uh, that his brain's startin' to come around.
They're just waitin' for his heart to stabilize.
I don't know who to believe.
Can I bring you back something to eat?
A falafel or some pizza?
No, we just ate.
I keep thinking about how tough my father was.
Now I know he had to be like that... to make us tough.
'Cause this city, it'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
No, the city doesn't discriminate.
It gets everybody.
I gotta go. Another call.
We're all dying, Mary Burke.
Get ready, Frank.
Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there.
Gonna be trauma tonight, baby.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Look at your screen!
Give us some blood!
66-Xray, a man at the bus terminal... shot three years ago says his arm hurts.
Come on, Tom. Pick up a job.
You want some bum in the bus terminal?
We'll wait for a real call.
- Let's get in a fight then.
That's your job.
- Who with?
Just keep driving.
Keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks.
We stop too long, we die.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something!
Let's bomb something!
- What do you wanna break? - I don't know.
Let's break some windows!
- Why? - Destruction!
Distraction!
I feel the need!
You need a reason, Frank.
You just don't go around breaking people's windows.
- What's the reason, Tom? Give me a reason.
All right, let me think.
Classic cabby move.
Hey, swami!
It's called a crosswalk!
You're supposed to stop before it, not on it!
You Senegalian raghead!
I know who to work over.
Him!
This guy's been terrorizin' the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got out of jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place.
You know, the term "menace to society" was made up for him!
- He's crazy. He can't help it.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, why don't they put him away?
Prisons don't want him.
I took him to the hospital yesterday. I gave him a cup of water.
I was very nice to him.
And here he is again. Oh!
Tell me that's a crazy person.
Every move is calculated!
He knows exactly what he is doing.
Frank, this is the guy.
I've been after him for weeks.
He's quick, though.
He runs like a rat. He'd be tough for one person.
- But with the two of us, you know...
- Okay, what do I do?
Okay, I'm gonna get out here.
If he sees me, he'll run. He doesn't like me.
You start talkin' to him about baseball or something.
I'll sneak around behind him and get down, and then you push him.
And when he falls, we get him.
- That's ridiculous. - Believe me, it always works.
The simpler, the better.
Havin' fun now!
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel.
- I'm thinking Mattingly in his prime.
- Mattingly ain't shit.
Me, I swing like Reggie. Huh?
Mr. October, number three.
Game six of the World Series.
Come on, take a crack at it.
It's okay.
Come on, hit it!
I better not.
Go ahead.
Give it a go.
Try it.
What the hell.
The next year, tiebreaker for the division in Boston.
The Yanks down two to nothing.
Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
- Lucky-Fucky-Bucky, man.
- The pitch: high heater.
Bucky knows what's comin'.
He steps in. Smash!
Over the Green Monster!
What the hell are you doin'?
Now get down those stairs and go after him!
You meet me back here in ten minutes if you can't find him.
Call out if you see him!
Remember, he runs like a rat!
Come on, Frank!
Get with the programme, man!
Why did you kill me, Frank?
I didn't mean to.
You should've helped me.
I tried to help.
I wanted to.
- Don't you love me?
To the moon, Alice!
We're gonna tube him!
- What the fuck?
- Get the kit!
You're gonna be all right, Noel. We're gonna save you.
Do it, Tom! I'll call for fuckin' backup! I swear!
You'd call for fuckin' backup?
You're gonna make it.
Who got that funky motherfucker this time?
Last show of the night.
What do you got? What...
Anybody else hurt? - No.
Get him over by the counter over there.
- All right, we're gonna need an X ray for a C-spine. - Got it.
I'm gonna need respiratory down here.
Crazy bastard.
At least he's intubated.
- Won't hear him screaming' tonight.
- People, hear me out.
Now, the path to your well-being and salvation will not be over Griss' body.
You can forget about that, 'cause Griss gets off in 47 minutes.
Then he's goin' home to take a bath. Nice warm bath...
Nurse Crupp, I'm gonna need another line here.
Fine.
One second.
Notify CAT scan. We're gonna need a C.T. right away.
Welcome home, buddy.
Oh, look who we have.
You're gonna have to start paying rent here.
Give me some gloves, please.
Nurse, call CAT scan. - Tell 'em we'll be there in a couple minutes.
Is Patrick Burke here?
I brought him in.
Where have you been?
What is it?
Let me go.
Code!
- He just coded.
- What a way to begin the day. Are we doing C.P. R?
- Mm-hmm.
One mil epi. Let me see this.
- Is this the man who was down in the E.R. for so long?
- Yes, it is.
Seventeen codes.
- Who's this man?
- He says he's the one who brought him in.
The family?
Seventeen codes.
Well, they must be prepared.
You know how they can be.
Yeah, I know.
Okay, stop C.P.R.
That's it. I'm calling it. 6:02.
Are you gonna tell the family?
Die! Die!
Son of a bitch!
Who is it? - Frank.
- Oh, come on up.
He's dead, Mary.
Your father passed.
They just moved him to the second floor, to I.C.U.
He coded.
They shocked him too many times. I'm sorry.
I don't know how he held on as long as he did.
I'm sorry.
You have to keep the body going... until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Forgive me, Rose.
It's not your fault.
No one asked you to suffer.
That was your idea.
Noel was almost killed.
I took care of him.
He's gonna pull through.
Would you like to come in?
... where the final lumbering remnants of the ice Age the massive and awe-inspiring glaciers calve cathedral-sized icebergs into the sea where nature's bounty unfolds in a panoply of flora and fauna the like of which is seen nowhere else on the planet.
From the ocean depths, plumbed by ageless cetaceans to azure skies, where the mighty eagle soars. This land abounds with creatures great and small, strange and majestic.
It is a land steeped in tradition its mists redolent of the hearty souls of men who have gone to sea.:
Tlingit and Haida Inuit and Aleut Russian and Norwegian.
Their languages and deeds Iingering on in the names of our countless islands and passageways.
A land that has lifted its siren call to the bold and adventurous to those willing to risk their lives for the promise of untold fortune be it from fur, fin, from the heaven- pointing spires of old-growth spruce or from the buried treasures of gold or black energy-rich petroleum.
A land visited each year by the relentless and mysterious salmon.
Each river and stream welcoming home the king and sockeye.... --the coho and dog, pink or humpback which is smashed into cans and quick-cooked to give the colourful local folks something to do other than play cards and scratch their nuts all day.
A land where that nice old lady from Fort Lauderdale who had the stroke three cabins down was probably parked next to the thawed-out halibut you'll eat tonight while your floating hotel chugs through the Hecate Strait to deliver its precious load of geriatrics to the hungry Visa-card-accepting denizens of our northernmost and most mosquito-infested state!
So?
What's " redolent"?
Having or emitting an odour.
You mean people wanna come here because of the smell?
Pleasantly fragrant!
-Not talking about this place.
-Damn right!
Soon as they close this down, they'll turn it into a tourist attraction!
They'll disinfect the joint, and you can get a job in one of those cases.
Like in a museum.
One of those displays.
Dioramas!
Dioramas.
In that diorama they'll hang fake fish guts all over you, put a label underneath:
"Typical Filipino Cannery Worker" !
Probably pay better than this.
