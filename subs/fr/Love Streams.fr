There was a bunch of pigs right here.
Gosh, this looks like a junkyard.
Well, there's your mother.
Robert, you're a coward.
You're disgusting.
And you make me sick the way you're hiding behind my baby!
This is not a baby!
This is Renee, she's my friend...
Yeah and I'm not a maid!
They're taking over the house, cigarettes, all the booze.
They're using the silver.
Put me down you turkey sandwich.
- Thanks for bringing my car back.
- Oh, you're welcome.
I'm Robert Harmon.
Hi, I'm Laurie.
They're in your bathroom.
They've got the jewerly all over, the makeup.
They take baths whenever they want to.
Hi, garbage lady!
I'm Phyllis.
- Stop trying to organize me, okay!
- I'm not trying to organize you, I'm...
This place looks like it's going to take three days to clean up.
- I'm Robert Harmon.
- Hi.
Joanie.
You're a beautiful girl, Joanie.
Do me a favor, will ya kids?
When you're finished doing what you're doing, just clean it up.
Because I only have a secretary, and she's a little annoyed right now, okay.
I'm Robert Harmon.
You're drinking champagne, that's nice.
So, just finish it up, and...
Oh, Hi, you must be Mr. Harmon.
I'm sorry, just having fun, just playing you know.
There wasn't enough hot water.
Joanie's gonna sing or recite.
This is champagne, that's orange juice, make a little marmosa.
Hurry up, like that, cuz we don't want to hold her up.
Just pour yourself something.
Put a lil "Champs-Elys√©es" in it.
You sell?
What?
Anything.
You sell love, you sell drugs, you sell poetry, whatever. What do you sell?
- How old are you?
- 18.
18, that's what you said.
18 ...
You dance?
Charlene tells me you sing.
Yeah, I try.
What do you sing?
I write poetry and I sing it.
Why don't you sing it?
I mean, you don't have to sing it.
You could recite it.
Just say it.
And don't look away, will you please, because I'm going to record you.
What are you doing, I don't know what you're doing?
See, a beautiful woman, has to offer a man her secrets.
I mean, that is so beautiful I can't tell you.
You see, everyone in the world is very screwed up.
Now I know that you're not screwed up And I'm not.
And I know the answer, and you know the answer.
But, we can't tell them the answer unless they ask us the question.
You see?
Tell me what a good time is.
A good time?
Yeah, you have to be with someone to have a good time, don't ya?
Yeah, that helps.
Sex?
I think we do need that.
Yeah, for money.
You don't enjoy it?
You need someone to be with to have a good time, don't ya?
Yeah, it helps.
Well, then tell me what a good time is.
Is it school?
Is it books, is it music, is it movies?
- What's the question?
- Good time, the best time, right?
Cooking.
I love to cook.
Cooking?
Cooking is the best time you've ever had?
Give me a break!
Give me another drink, over here.
I guess dreaming.
What do you dream?
Are you gay?
No.
Sorry.
No, I'm not.
It's okay.
Don't worry.
You're safe here.
I'm Jill Dunbar.
The judge.
I'm Sarah Lawson.
This is my daughter Debbie.
Judge Dunbar?
Hi, I'm Milton Kravitz.
I represent Mrs. Lawson.
Have you two met?
Are you comfortable there?
Yeah, sure.
Sorry we're late.
Traffic was terrible.
You're beautiful.
Come over and sit here, please.
Why don't we have Debbie wait outside?
There is no reason for her to be here?
No, it's okay.
I want to be here.
Sure, go outside Debbie.
It'll just take a minute and we'll call you right back in.
Jack, could she stay here, please?
I mean, she knows everything.
We don't want our baby standing out in the hall.
We are in agreement on the money settlement.
That is correct.
And Debbie has agreed to live with her mother, there is no disagreement on that.
You sign these, we can finish quickly.
I have immediate plans to take Debbie with me to Houston or New York.
I don't know when we'll be back.
New York?
Houston?
Where did that come in?
We're not gonna go to a funeral.
It's okay.
What is the understanding that you've come to on this visit?
You see, we go to a lot of funerals.
I go to funerals, and hospitals and some weddings.
You might say that's what I do:
I visit sick people.
Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, uncles, nephews, aunts.
I don't have any relatives myself, but Jack does.
Some of these are in Houston, and Jack's aunt is in New York.
Which I would feel very uncomfortable going to if she wasn't there.
But nobody died this time.
Just sick, you know.
People like Debbie and me to be with them when they aren't feeling well, because we're cheerful.
Says right here: "Visiting privileges every other weekend.
From Saturday noon til Sunday at 7.
Mr. Lawson will be entitled to take Debbie Lawson to where he resides or any other reasonable place."
Wasn't that what you had agreed to?
You see Judge when someone is temporarily insane like Jack here is...
And he's a wonderful guy, but...
You see, when someone is like that, they don't want to see the people that they really love.
Okay, I understand that.
A person who is sick has to get well before he can be normal, right?
So, when Jack finishes his... sleeping around everywhere, and he wants to assume his responsibilities, he wants to be a real father to Debbie, he can see her.
If Debbie is a very old lady when he makes up his mind, that's when he'll see her.
I don't understand.
You feel that your husband should not see Debbie at all?
Well, I object.
I think Mrs. Lawson is breaking the understanding.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
He's the one that wants a divorce.
One of the reasons we're having difficulty with something we've already agreed to, is that my wife hasn't been cured.
I'm a very happy person.
My wife has been in and out of institutions since our marriage.
That's one of the reasons why we're having difficulty with something that we've already agreed to.
She hasn't been cured.
I have a problem.
I...
I love my family.
I love him, and I love her.
I love them, just them.
And, when I can't be cheerful...
When you get a headache, or you feel really bad.
I go to the hospital.
And I stay there until I feel that I can take care of things again.
Just stepping out of the way for awhile.
Until his little sex things are over...
Whatever it is that causes me to get the headaches...
Something like that.
Could I have a glass of champagne in a crystal glass, please?
I love crystal!
I'm Phyllis.
That's my stage name.
Lovely nails you have.
You're a straight and a marvelous writer.
I just love the way you write about loneliness.
You make it sound so exciting and romantic.
I saw you in here last month.
Are you working on a new book?
Are you doing something on us?
Yes, I'm writing a book on nightlife, as a matter of fact.
Could I have your telephone number please, your card, something?
Lucky boy!
Now is this for research or what?
It's uh...
She's beautiful.
You know her name?
Susan.
I think with all beautiful women, they have a secret.
And the interesting thing, is to get that secret out.
If they volunteer that secret to me.
Yeah, I guess.
I'm a writer, that's why I'm saying that.
I know, I saw you on TV.
Haven't read any of your books, though, don't have too much time.
- I did the cigarette trick...
- Watch the tablecloth.
Give me your glass.
What should we drink to?
I can't think of anything.
You're ambitious enough, I think.
When I came in here about a month ago, there were these two very cute little girls that were singing along with you.
They're not here anymore.
And that bothers me.
- Does it bother you?
- No.
What time is it?
I want to write a book about you.
Why, you think I want to be a big star?
I've gotta go.
It was fun.
I like the way you move.
I really like the way you move.
I'm right here.
That's nice.
Give me your keys, give me your keys.
My dress!
You know what they say about beautiful women.
Their secrets.
They'll give 'em to you gladly, this is...
Where do you live?
Do you know where you live?
Get out, okay.
Get out of here!
Well then, move over.
Gotta get out of my car.
Get out!
Out of my car!
Enough, okay!
Come on!
Let go!
Get out of here.
You're amazingly strong.
I'll drive, alright.
Where do you live?
I'll drive.
Make a right, at the corner.
Okay, this is fine, this is fine, stop.
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!
Turn off the lights.
Turn the radio off.
Are you crazy?
Give me the keys.
Can you walk?
Come on, we gotta get off the street.
Put your arm around me.
You taking me to bed?
Where are we?
My house.
Perfect ending to a lovely evening.
I'm alright.
I'm usually a lot more fun, I'll tell you that right now.
Come on darling, I want you to eat some soup now.
Do the best you can. Cuz I've got to get you out of this room so the child can play.
Hi, Robert.
I'll be right with you.
Is that your mom?
I really should give you a lot of money, but I...
A few thousand dollars will do.
I want to thank you very, very much for what you've done.
You're very welcome.
I was really the one who did the most for you.
She wouldn't do anything.
I had to undress you.
You're the one that undressed me? You took all my clothes off?
And you nursed me, and you washed my shirt?
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
But I don't want you to be a mother now.
Because it confuses me when a beautiful women like you becomes a mother.
I'm not a mother really.
Good bye, thank you.
Excuse me, please.
I'm really sorry to be late.
Well, you understand.
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me...
Okay.
We can start.
Mother.
I want to go with my father.
I hate my life with you.
I hate going to see all those dying people.
I hate being with those old people.
They smell.
Excuse me, could I sit there, please?
They smell?
When did you first decide that they smell?
I want to go with my father.
I don't want to go with you anymore.
I don't want to be a slave.
Nice...
Nobody leave this room until we find out what it means.
I can discuss it.
I have a lot of time.
What is it that you want to discuss?
Love.
We're dealing with legal matters.
And as painful as it seems, this is usual in divorce cases.
Please, Mrs. Lawson.
I must ask you to sit down, please.
Roll her over on her side.
You're going to be okay, darling.
Just relax.
You're doing real good.
Just relax.
We love you.
We love you. Just relax.
So what do you think that is?
Loss.
You don't own anything.
So how can you lose something that you don't own?
Love is a stream.
It's continuous.
It doesn't stop.
No, it does stop.
Oh no, it does not stop.
Your love is too strong for your family.
I want you to describe your sexual life.
- I don't have a sexual life.
- You do.
I don't need a sexual life.
What other interests do you have besides your husband?
He doesn't love you.
That's not true.
And your daughter who chose him over you.
If you don't let go, and if you don't get some balance in your life, something creative, some sex, I don't care with whom, then you're going to have to go back to the bughouse where you don't belong.
Go to Europe.
They don't know you there.
You have money, see something.
Be alone.
Meet someone, you're attractive.
Oh, thank god.
Will you help me, please?
I am American, and I must have your help.
I have all of this luggage.
I'll give you $25 if you help me, please.
Listen to me. Listen.
You can understand me if you want to.
I have to get this baggage, I have no one to help me.
Maybe you should get a carriage.
But I must get to track 9.
And I'm already late.
You'll take it for me, right?
You're not going to go away, are you?
You're coming back, right?
I'm going to wait for you right here.
I'll be right here, okay.
That's good.
You're just fine, just go on ahead.
That's it. Over a little bit to the right. That's it.
Wait. Wait.
I've got it.
Are you taking a bus or do you want a taxi?
No, I want a plane.
I'm going to go home.
I've got to get out of here.
Well you can't take a plane from here, love.
This is a train station, they roll 'em out of here.
I've got to get home.
Listen, would you do me a favor?
Would you make a call for me, please.
Would you telephone my husband.
I want to call him in Chicago, Illinois.
I hate Europe.
Can I have the overseas operator, please.
- France was worse.
- I don't like that place much myself.
Yes, I'd like to place a personal call.
Couldn't talk to anybody there.
Who am I calling?
Mr. Jack Lawson.
In the United States.
What's his number, love?
Reverse the charges.
What's your name, love?
Sarah.
Here you go, love. They're ringing right through.
Come on.
I'm almost not crazy now.
I just don't care.
You alright, love?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hi, Robert.
How are you?
How have you been?
What are you doing here?
Well, I happened to be in the neighborhood...
Actually I hadn't heard from you and I wondered how you were.
Actually, my mother was worried about you.
I think she misses you.
Everybody's always worried about me.
Actually I'm fine, you can see that.
And I can't let you in.
It's okay, I don't want to come in.
Guess you have company.
You're right there.
I've got to go to work.
I wanted to ask you something.
Do you think we should see each other again or what?
I'd like for us to be friends, if you want a friend.
Take care of yourself, Robert.
Keep in touch, okay?
Oh, geez, turn the light off.
I'm going to kill someone.
What's the matter?
I'm looking for my white shoes.
White shoes.
Did you see Phyllis' big white shoes?
Underneath the kitchen table.
Get that, please.
So what?
Who was it?
There's a car coming around to the front.
There is some lady and a little boy here.
And he's carrying a whole bunch of flowers.
They're coming up to the front door, Robert.
This is your son.
You owe him for four weeks.
You want this in one check, or you want it in four checks?
One check.
Here is some flowers.
Thank you.
But let me just get this...
Robert, I gotta ask you a favor.
Would you do it?
If it's for money, yes.
You asked me not to call, so I wrote you 3 letters.
I just don't answer my mail.
My husband and I, we have a big chance to raise some money in someone's big house.
We'll stay overnight.
And they don't want kids.
- You want me to take the boy.
- Yeah, overnight.
- Until when?
- We'll be home tomorrow at 2pm.
Alright.
You haven't even seen your son since he was born.
I said yes, didn't I?
I'll be home Sunday night.
Today's Saturday.
I even have Albie's suitcase in the car.
Fine, let's get the suitcase and let's get on with it.
Come on, let's go.
Wave goodbye to your mother.
Flowers.
Really nice, wanna hold 'em?
Close the door.
I'm gonna introduce you to some people.
This is my son Albie.
I'd like to introduce you to Charlene, who is my secretary, my friend, my accountant and her daughter Renee who is also my friend.
- How old are you?
- 8.
Well, let's go.
Yeah, what do you want?
This is my son Albie.
He's going to spend the night with us.
Hi, Albie.
What's wrong?
Robert, go get him.
He's your son for god's sake!
- Alright, come on. Let's go.
- Mr. Harmon?
Don't call me Mr. Harmon.
That's insulting.
I know it and you know it.
- I hate you.
- Yeah I know, that's cuz I'm your father.
The boy still asleep?
Yeah, he's upstairs in bed.
Here's your check.
Thank you, darling.
Mary, Annette.
Thank you, I love you.
Joanie.
Joanie, I'm sorry Phyllis.
Charlene, have your numbers?
Take good care of these chickens, okay.
You take care, bye baby.
You're the man now, you take care of these little children.
Goodbye kids, good luck in your new careers.
Bye bye, sweetheart.
We'll be alright, Robert.
You better get back to the kid.
You shouldn't leave him alone.
Are you awake?
Go to your right, then go right again.
Can I use your toothbrush?
Use your finger.
I want to have breakfast, but I have to clean up first.
If I have breakfast without cleaning up I vomit.
You get through with this, you can help me... get these empty cigarette packs off here... and this stuff here, then we can eat.
All done.
Want a drink?
Would you like a Coca-Cola, or a beer?
A beer.
Would you like a little toast?
Did you run away because I was born?
No, I didn't even know you were coming.
I don't like men a lot, you know.
I'm a writer.
I don't make money on men.
No one's really interested.
They're kinda boring.
When you're 14 I think you oughta... hitchhike across the country, go into a truckstop, stop there.
Have a cup of coffee, and see what men are really like, you know.
Men. Not these people out here with the suits and ties... that kind of stuff, you know.
I had a picture of you.
My father tore it up.
My mother cried, they had a big fight, and he hit her.
And they changed my name to Albie Swanson, like his.
And mother cries all the time thinking about you.
Please come back to her.
She sleeps with another man every night, you know.
You know what that means?
She has had a baby by another man.
So, that part of... that part of... is over.
I don't like women anyway, you know.
I really don't. I like kids.
And I like older people.
Cuz they seem to have the secret... They don't need anything.
You don't need anything.
They just want...
You're innocent.
And so are old people, they're innocent.
That's what I like about them.
Drink your drink here.
Come on, drink it down.
Hey, dad!
What's wrong?
Someone's here. There's a cab outside.
There's two cabs.
You go out there and you tell them to go away.
I have a lady in the cab.
Paris.
Dad?
This is my son Albie, from the second marriage.
Albie, Sarah.
Oh, my god.
I haven't seen you...
I haven't seen him since he was in the hospital being born.
I would've brought you a present, only I didn't know I was going to be here... I didn't know you were going to...
I didn't know I was going to...
Hi.
- A load of trunks.
- Yeah, I see that.
Well take them all into the house, alright.
Alright Jim, let's get these bags.
Let's take it in.
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe I got here, I can't believe I'm actually here.
I can't believe I'm seeing you.
You're nuts.
You're really nuttier than fruitcake.
I love you.
Where do these bags go?
Bags go- you can put 'em on the first floor or the upstai... put 'em on the upstairs landing, alright?
Just, on the upstairs landing.
That'll be good.
How about a drink?
No, I really shouldn't.
Perhaps, well, one maybe.
One only, cuz I was flying first class and...
- Well, this is not going to hurt ya.
- Make it a weak one, please.
Get a little ice.
Need a little ice for ya.
Put it in this glass.
Sorry, excuse me.
Do you like your father?
Well he happens to be a wonderful person, everybody likes him.
- Will you have vodka, scotch?
- Yeah, just a small one really.
Albie's mother brought him over here, cuz I haven't seen him since he was born either.
We were just reminiscing, going over old times.
Gettin' drunk.
And I'm gonna take him to Las Vegas.
Las Vegas?
You want to go?
Do you want her to go?
No.
- Okay, go get your bag.
- But dad.
Get your bad, let's go.
You want to see the rest of the house?
Come on, I'll show you the house.
This is the kitchen.
The kitchen.
- Can you drive?
- Sure I can drive.
Here are the keys to my car, and you go down to... you go down to... out of the driveway, turn right, go down right again, then you hit Ventura.
And there's a big shopping center down there and you can't miss it.
I read all your books.
Yeah, they're in the bookcase.
- They're all about women.
- I know.
What took you so long?
If anyone calls, just say I died.
Yeah?
How long are you going to be dead?
I don't know. Couple of days, just say.
Who was that?
- Sarah, you mean?
- Yeah, Sarah.
Do you love her?
Not the way you mean.
Do you kiss her?
Not the way you mean, I said.
Imperial Palace.
Ah, Dean !
How are ya?
Here for a little RR, or ya gonna make an assault on us this trip?
- Ah, I got my bodyguard with me.
- Your a computer expert, I know it.
Albie, This is Dean Shindel.
Say hello.
Your suite's blocked and your tux is pressed and on the way up.
Where would you like your bag, Mr. Harmon?
On the bed.
That's fine.
- Here ya are, my friend.
- Thank you, sir.
There's your key.
- Your tuxedo. - Oh good.
Thank you.
Put it right there on the chair.
You have the shoes?
The shirt, the tie, everything in there?
- Anything else?
- No, no.
Here.
How do you feel?
Okay.
Still a little drunk?
Stomach a little upset?
You oughta go to sleep.
Listen.
I'm a man.
And a man, is different than a little kid.
I find it very hard to go to sleep alone.
You know what I mean, don't you?
- Do you?
- Yeah.
Maid!
Can I turn down your bed?
Did you just get in?
Earlier.
You're all by yourself, huh?
You hungry?
A big boy like you is not hungry?
When did you eat last?
Where's your mom?
In Los Angeles.
Not right now.
Oh, I gotta give you checks.
Carla Friedricks.
Spell it.
Gotta see my son, you know.
Love is everything.
Love is everything. Just remember that.
- Go.
- I love you girls.
Remember the Alamo.
Remember Smokey Joe.
Take me home, please. I want to go home.
I want to see my mother, my mom.
I want to go.
I want to see my mother. I want my mom.
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I tell you I was gonna go out all night?
Didn't I?
I told you I was going out all night, I was gonna be with somebody, didn't I?
And you said okay, right?
You said you're gonna be a man and I'm gonna be a man, right?
No, don't do that!
- Didn't I say to you... - I want to go.
Didn't I say to you, didn't I say to you that I was going...
Wait a minute now.
Didn't I say I was going out with somebody?
Didn't I say I was gonna go find somebody?
I want to go.
I want to see my mother.
I want to go home.
I want to go.
- Get out.
Where is your house?
- Right over there.
Albie, I just want to say I'm sorry the vacation didn't work out.
Mom!
Albie, what happened to yourself? Come on, what happened?
What happened, son.
Did he do this to you? What happened?
What did he do to you?
I'm Robert Harmon.
Eddie, stop!
Stop it, Eddie!
It's not your son, Eddie!
... your ass long enough ...
Stay there!
Dad, I love you dad.
I love you, dad.
Come on.
I love him.
He's my father, I love him.
Dad, I love you.
I love you, dad.
- He's your son, Robert.
- Too late.
Robert, he's your son!
Here we are, pal. 28 dollars.
G'night.
Susan called.
She called me?
That's your girlfriend, isn't it?
Uh, Robert Harmon here.
Yeah.
You are Margarita.
You're the mother.
Well listen, I'm the guy that got sick all over your house.
I thought I'd come over and have a drink with you and thank you.
Don't argue with me.
I won't take no for an answer.
Be there in 20 minutes.
Fought with Albie, huh?
Yeah, well, life is a series of suicides, divorces, promises broken, children smashed, whatever.
You oughta go to sleep.
I'm not sleepy.
It's only about 9 o'clock.
You look awful.
Gotta get some rest, gotta go out and get some sun, this is California.
Ya know, with kids I don't think you can do the right thing.
I mean, you always think you know just what's suppose to be, and...
You know what my shrink told me? You know what this quack...
Watch your feet here.
You know the guy in Chicago.
He told me, his big advice was to go to Europe, to find some handsome guy, to have a love affair, if that didn't work, I was suppose to be creative, paint.
Can we walk and talk?
Hey, I don't want to go to bed.
No more emotion now, let's go.
I'm not being emotional.
I just, I'm tired.
Oh, I wanna go- you're right.
I'm going to bed.
Very tired.
Get out of here.
I have to go. I have to see this old lady about a house.
And I have to have a drink with her, and I have to change my clothes, and I have to take a shower, and I have to be really neat, okay?
I'll have breakfast with you in the morning.
I'm gonna turn off the light.
What's all this, what are you doing?
I need some crystal glasses, and some ice, and...
- I've got everything.
- You do?
Come on in.
Sarah.
Sarah, I need you.
I know this doesn't make any sense, but this house is very, very empty without you.
I love you, you dumbo-head.
We're divorced, Sarah.
That part of our life is over.
I'm just saying that it's... it's hard to... tough to bring up a kid.
I know it doesn't make any sense, but that's what you should be doing.
Goodbye, Sarah.
I want you to be patient with me because I don't know exactly where I'm going yet.
How are you?
To tell you the truth, I'm...
Tell you the truth I'm very concerned about my daughter.
Well, we're all concerned.
Oh god, you too?
Oh, I'm sorry, well...
You know all about it too then, huh?
About it?
About the balance, and...
Tell you the truth, this is my first time, and I... I'm looking for the sex.
Well, you'll need bowling shoes.
Oh thanks, I don't use 'em.
Well, you're on lane 13, mam.
Hey, honey.
- You're gonna slip all over the place.
- Don't worry about it.
You want me to keep score?
You can if you want to, but it isn't necessary. I don't keep score.
You don't keep score?
If I bowl a strike, I remember it.
Alright, give me one.
Give me one, come on.
Right down the middle.
Watch this.
You're better than Al!
You're better than Al! He's a bum.
My first husband- i mean, my only husband- anyway, he loved to bowl.
Okay, lets see two in a row. Five dollars, Al.
Two in a row, okay?
Okay.
Brace yourselves.
She's doing better than you, Dottie, I'll tell you that right now.
Don't wait, honey.
Don't wait.
Just roll the ball, ya gotta have a follow-through.
Just relax, just relax.
What, Ken?
Let me tell you something, look.
Let me tell ya. If you stand up...
Now wait a second.
If you stand up, I got the ball right here. You got no pressure, right.
No, wait a second now.
Now go ahead.
Just relax, okay. Take a deep breath.
Put the chalk, put the chalk on there.
Now watch this.
Watch. Pull it out.
It's alright.
- There you go.
- It was easy.
Isn't that crazy.
It doesn't hurt or anything.
Thank you.
- That certainly never happened.
- I'm gonna put it back.
No, I'm not afraid.
I've got another one coming.
Do you walk?
You're a good dancer, you walk?
I walk, I run, I do everything.
Okay you walk with me, ready?
You dance by yourself, let me see your stuff.
I haven't done this for a long time.
Let's sit down like ladies and gentlemen here.
Let's sit down here like ladies and gentlemen.
Let me seat you.
I'm sorry.
Don't get embarrassed ... asses.
A beautiful light, and a beautiful red dress.
Honey, you're late
Hello Frank, how are you?
Oh we were having such a party.
I'm sorry you came in so late.
Come on over and meet Robert.
We were having such a good time.
You asleep?
Are you okay?
Ya wanna glass of milk?
Tomorrow morning.
Give me a kiss.
Go back to sleep.
Honey, don't worry.
Billy is alright.
We were having such a good time.
I was showing Robert how I used to dance, but I couldn't make up a good enough costume.
Mom, go to bed now, okay?
You go home, okay?
Party's over alright.
I gotta get up early tomorrow, that's why.
Goodnight, darling.
She's a wonderful woman.
She doesn't get a chance to go out and show off a lot, you know.
I know.
Goodnight, teeth.
I love you. Goodnight.
I had a wonderful time.
A wonderful time.
Thank you.
You are the cutest guy I ever met.
You want some coffee?
Nah, no thanks, babe.
I had the most wonderful time tonight.
Yeah, you look happy.
What is creativity, Robert?
What is creativity?
No, I don't mean, you know, I know you're a writer and you're creative.
People paint.
But I don't paint.
Would you consider cooking...
an art?
Cooking?
Yeah.
I'm trying to find something.
You know, just something I could do.
I don't mean I'm the only person in the world that can do it, you know, but just... something that I could- something special.
You know like cooking, or...
Writing?
You could do some poetry. Write poetry.
No. Poetry, I love it, but it's just so depressing.
I always get so low.
No, I don't think that's healthy.
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
Would love be considered an art?
Well, some people think so.
You're a writer, you're always writing those books about sex.
Maybe you could write one about love, I could help you with that.
We'll see how that works out.
I love you.
I love you.
I'm going to do this damned thing, I really am.
I'm going to find balance.
And I think you should do it too.
I'm going to do something for you.
I'm going to buy you a baby.
Really.
You really need some... living thing that you can love, Robert.
It could be just a little animal that you could take care of and kiss and sleep with.
Please don't.
And you'd be balanced, I'd be balanced.
Then I can go back to being obsessive about my family.
You know what dad always said?
No, what did dad always say?
For every problem, there is an answer.
I'm not gonna have coffee, I'm gonna take a bath.
I'm gonna go right to bed. I'm gonna get up at dawn.
Goodnight, honey.
Mother?
Are you alright?
How can you ask me if I'm alright?
Did you find your sex, mom?
Is that what you were looking for?
Ask your father to come to the phone.
It's making me ill what you're doing to dad.
You wanted the divorce.
Please call your father to the phone.
- He's asleep.
- Wake him up.
You think I'm afraid to call him.
Mother please leave him alone.
Listen to me.
You do what I tell you, and you do it right now.
Call your father to this phone.
Alright, alright. Fine, I will. Just hold on.
You have no mercy.
Alright, that's fine with me.
But you leave our kid out of this.
This is our biggest and it is our only problem.
Hey, I'm 13. I'm not a child, honey. I know more than you do.
Jack, would you answer one question for me?
Do you believe that love is a continuous stream?
Sarah, we have a little daughter going through puberty right now.
And she's more important than you are right now.
I'm not taking care of you anymore, Sarah.
We're divorced.
Please have the grace not to explain to my sister what a divorce is.
And stop lecturing her!
Well then don't call her, and leave her alone!
- You alright?
- I'm washing my face.
Love is dead.
Love is a fantasy little girls have.
I'm tired.
I just want to be by myself.
How old is she? 13?
I mean, is she 13 years old?
She's hit puberty for god's sakes. That's whats happened to her!
You know absolutely nothing about children.
I don't intend to discuss my daughter with you.
You have a husband, right?
Is he in architecture?
Architect, right? He's just like me.
He's a guy.
He's a man. He loves women.
- He goes out with women. He has a good time.
- You're talking about a guy...
I've been with for 15 years, who's put food on the table and clothes on her back.
We've had experiences of the heart you couldn't even imagine.
You're talking about a guy who held my hand in the hospital, who cried when his baby was born.
Where were you?
Sarah, what are all these flowers doing here?
This looks like somebody died and went to a wake.
Those flowers are from the garden, dummy.
I told you I was going to get you a baby.
And I'm over here at animal shelter- Kiners something- getting you one.
I'm gonna change your life around a little bit.
You don't like me now, but when I get home with what I'm gonna get home with, you're gonna be crazy about me.
Was that your husband?
Your fiance?
Well I must say I'm very curious as to know who it was.
That was my closest and my dearest friend.
And he doesn't want me to buy a baby.
- What does he want you to do?
- Oh, I don't know.
Actually, we're both pretty screwed up. But I really think he's in more trouble than I am.
Is he a tall man or a short man?
Listen, I better get going.
How much do I owe you for that telephone call?
I have some bunny rabbits.
I have a crow.
A parrot.
I have a parakeet.
A parakeet is a wonderful pet for a man.
No thank you.
Now, you ask, I do have the one billy goat, which you can see he's a very handsome fellow.
Then I've got the nanny goat, You like goat cheese, perfect opportunity.
Then I've got these two ducks.
- Sweet.
And I've got the mallard over there.
- He's a handsome rooster.
The rooster- wake you up every morning, keep you company.
I was thinking maybe, do you have any kittens, or dogs?
I do have one dog.
That's Lenny and that's Jim.
They are inseparable.
They don't get much work done, but they are the best of friends.
And they seem to understand each other.
No, that's a nasty dog.
I don't like that dog at all.
Well, to look at him there isn't too much in his favor.
No, there really isn't.
But he is a great dog for a man.
No, thank you.
No on that dog.
He is so much like a man.
And you admire, and you praise, and the dog opens up, And he's a warm, wonderful and fine human being.
You are so strong!
Go ahead and try.
No, he doesn't know me.
Maybe I shouldn't.
Jim knows Mrs. Lawson loves him, don't you Jim?
Come on, just give it a shot.
Don't be afraid.
Hello, Jim.
I'm Mrs. Lawson.
Try again.
Just try slowly.
Don't be afraid.
You don't want to scare me.
You're so much bigger, and you're so strong.
And you're very handsome.
You're very handsome.
You look just like somebody that I know.
Yes you do.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.
Oh, is that a good dog.
Look at that. Oh, good boy...
He's terrific. He's a wonderful dog.
A wonderful dog, yes you are. Yes you are.
You look just like somebody I know, yeah you do.
He is terrific.
That's, I'm gonna take him.
That's won
- I want to take him.
And we've got the parakeet.
You know what I need now, a little something soft, little and soft.
Little and soft?
Goodbye, Jim. Goodbye, Jim.
Oh, this is terrific. This is just great.
That's it now. Here we are home.
Wait a minute, can you take this one?
There you are, and this one.
And then the
- I'll get the- Have you got the leash?
I got it, I got it.
Come on Rex.
That's a wild one you got there.
You come on a little easier.
Here we are.
Come on, we come home now.
Okay, now I want to show him the horses.
The chickens in the...
Alright, can you hold the goat?
No, I'll hold the goat, and then you've got those still.
What do you think, huh?
Is this nice?
Is this a nice place to live?
Oh, you're such good boys, yeah.
Alright, where's the duck now?
The duck I don't know.
Wait a minute.
You take that, I'll take- here, I got the chickens.
Can you still get the duck or shall I take...
I'll have to come back for the duck.
What do you think?
You like it.
Are you good boys.
Come on, let's go see Robert.
I know this sounds crazy, but I just got carried away.
I couldn't resist these...
These are miniature horses.
Aren't they small?
Aren't they?
I was gonna only take one, but then I figured they'd get lonely and if you have one, you might as well have two.
Anyway, the goat gives milk, so that's not a waste.
And the chickens and the duck will have eggs eventually.
And we can eat those and we'll all live here at the park.
Well, we'll talk about it in a minute.
I'm gonna take these in and give them a little food and some water.
It was really hot coming over.
It's going to be alright, Robert.
I'll talk in just a minute, okay.
- Have you got him?
- Yeah, I need a little hand with this one.
We're gonna stick you in the nice park.
Oh, you're gonna like this, you're gonna like this, right in the shade.
We're gonna give you nice, fresh water.
Have you got the chickens?
Where's the duck?
Come on, boys. Come on.
Over here.
There you go.
Come on, chick-chick. Come on, chickies.
Come on, out you go.
Can you get 'em?
Come on, you little rascal.
I don't know.
I don't know if this is such a hot idea?
He didn't seem too enthusiastic about my park.
I'm sure he thinks I'm crazy as a bed-bug.
What do you think?
I'm gonna get these little guys some water, cool 'em off a little bit.
It's a plenty hot day.
Come on, oh I'm gonna show you something nice, come on.
I'm gonna show you something you haven't seen.
Gonna take you up to the high country.
You are such strong guys.
So delicate.
Gee, I hope I'm doing the right thing for you fellas too.
Okay, just run, run. Run free.
Come on, Jim. This is it.
This is Lenny and this is Jim.
I need a drink.
Excuse me.
I'll take him.
Don't give me any trouble now, don't give me any trouble now.
Dr. Williams?
Hi, I'm Robert Harmon.
So tell me, who is the patient?
Sarah had these two little miniature horses, and a goat, and she didn't know that I was going to respond so poorly when she brought Lenny and Jim over, so they couldn't find the duck and the little chicks disappeared, so...
Excuse me, but where is she?
She's in here.
Don't be alarmed.
I'm Dr. Williams.
What seems to be the trouble?
I don't know who I am.
- Do you know where you are?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who am I, who am I?
Just a minute, just a minute.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Am I your brother?
Am I your mother?
Am I Jim?
Who am I?
Could you please step outside for a moment?
Here, take your bag.
We don't need you, alright.
I'll pay you your bill.
I'm sorry, goodbye, thank you.
Now just go.
Here is your bag, here it is.
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?
Come here.
Mr. Harmon, I think Sarah is in trouble.
Her eyes are not responding the way I'd like them to, and her neck is stiff.
Now, you can do what you want, but I'd like you to get her to see somebody if it's not me.
She's fine... thank you.
You're very welcome.
I'll let myself out.
Sarah, you're one of the greatest people that I've ever met in my life.
I fed the horses.
I fed the goat.
You gotta get well.
You're not sick.
I got chicken soup on and I put okra in it, and I know you hate okra.
You're the best.
You gotta fight it.
You're the best.
Nice hot cup of tea.
Come on, try this now.
Nice hot cup of tea, smell it.
You're crazy as a bed-bug.
You're not gonna make me laugh, I don't have a sense of humor.
We'll see.
This is the most ridiculous, crazy idea I've ever heard.
- You're pitiful.
- That's enough.
That is enough.
I want you to stand right there.
I want you to look right into my eyes. You hear nothing but the sound of my voice.
Does my fox face mean anything to you?
Not funny.
Nevermind.
In 30 seconds, you are going to be laughing helplessly.
You don't believe, huh, you wanna bet?
What do you bet?
A dollar.
Oh, cheapskate.
What do you bet?
I'm the highroller, I'm gonna bet, I'm gonna bet...
Love.
I'm gonna bet the ultimate, okay.
First of all, I'm going to give you a drink of scotch and soda, Want you to have a coca-cola.
Want you all to be in a very good mood.
But I don't care, I don't care. I'm willing to take the chance.
Jack, what do you want?
Do you want mustard or ketchup?
Some people think that's my best joke, because most people laugh just at the word ketchup.
Debbie, you open the peanut brittle, please. While I show daddy this flower.
And here, I'm gonna put this up here.
Well you don't have a lapel, but it smells nice anyway.
Anyway, I'm sorry, that was a dirty trick, I'm gonna do something nice for ya.
You want some popcorn, sweetheart?
You want some popcorn?
I've got the popcorn.
I mean, it's real popcorn on a string.
How about the anniversary present?
Would I forget our anniversary, sweetheart?
It's a fancy pen.
Debbie, you think I forgot you?
I didn't.
Don't think I forgot you, Debbie, cuz I never forget you.
And I know that the- or at least last week, it was your graduation, and I know you like pearl earrings, don't you? Come on, you like it?
I want to take a good look at both of you, and I want to see what I see here.
I see twins, that's what I see. Twins.
You guys are a couple of- you really are.
A two of a pair.
This is for us.
Jack, this is for our old age.
Come over here and stand by daddy.
Over here, stand by dad.
I want to take your picture.
Mom, you're not funny.
Smile.
Smile.
Hey Jack, look this way. Here you go.
That's it. Here we go.
Time is running up...
Are you ready?
Here it goes.
Are you ready to laugh?
Just go inside.
We gotta get to Sarah's bedroom.
Come on, duckies.
I got the horses in, and I couldn't get the goat. I mean, the goat is just impossible.
You know, there are secrets women have. A young girl...
And she comes up to you, she's infatuated with you, she always wants to tell you her secrets, she volunteers them.
And she says: "I've done some nude modeling", you know, so the delicate balance of that relationship won't break.
If you're in love with someone and the woman keeps the secret,
doesn't give it to you, doesn't offer it to you, then that part of her is always dead to you.
I'm gonna get that goat.
You alright?
Oh good, you look wonderful. You really do.
Wanna come out with me?
See the goat?
You promised me that I would be the only one.
How I missed you.
Mama.
In love, I'm not sure of... of me.
And that, I'm not sure of... of you.
I'm not sure of love.
I'm not sure of me, of you.
Mama.
Let me know.
No, Debbie, don't go.
Come back, baby. I love you.
She's a killer.
You know she'll kill you.
I love that face.
And I will be the only one... to love that face.
The only one.
You promised me.
So I love that face.
I love you... both.
I had the most wonderful dream.
Where's Robert?
Robert?
Are you out there?
I'll be right in!
Don't come out here!
I've come to the most fantastic new understanding with Jack.
I've made it up with him, and with Debbie too.
Talked to him on the telephone, or you dreamt this?
Look, I'm not kidding around.
I do not want you to go to some guy that doesn't love you.
I love you. And I want you to stay here.
And I want you to stay here forever.
I'm taking care of the animals, I'm taking care of everything.
- I'm gonna get a plane tonight.
- No.
I have to.
I have to.
Who the hell is that?
Who the fuck are you?
- Who are you?
- I'm Ken.
Hello, doggy.
How are ya?
You're Robert?
- Want a drink?
- No, thank you.
Ken, hi, how are you?
Thank you for coming.
Could you help me upstairs.
I have a whole bunch of stuff up there.
I really appreciate you coming.
I know it's a terrible night, I just have so much stuff, I don't know what to do with it.
That's right.
Get him.
Go upstairs. Come on with me.
Kill the big man.
Speak.
Speak.
Get him. Get him.
Come on, Jim.
Get the big man.
Come on.
Chicken shit.
Wanna listen to music?
Wanna listen to music?
I don't want you to go.
I love you.
You're the only one I love.
Don't you "shush" me.
Who the hell you think you are to "shush" me?
I don't want you to go.
You're gonna go out in all this rain?
I'm gonna stay the night with Ken, okay.
The trunk won't fit.
Leave it, just leave it.
Him and I were the last two left out of the original...
And when you were shelled, how did you feel?
I don't know. I just...
After Norman got hurt...
Killed, why...
I was all right when we were moving up, or attacked, or anything like that, but when we'd get pinned down, I'd start thinking about him laying back there.
I believe that your profession is calling it nostalgia.
- In other words, homesickness.
It was induced when, shortly before the war, I received a picture of my sweetheart.
Yes?
I'm sorry. I can't continue.
That's all right.
Well, when I was in combat, Mindanao...
Can you speak louder?
- I have trouble hearing you.
- Yes, sir. During that time... I got word that my brother, he was killed at Guadalcanal.
You feeling okay, Ivan? Yeah.
What are you thinking about right now?
Home, sir.
Going home.
So, how many medals did they give you?
Just one.
I thought your chest would be all covered with them.
Did you kill all the Japs, or leave some?
- We got most of them.
- Good.
Of course... If I'd been there, it wouldn't have taken so long.
I heard they had you in one of their camps.
Why didn't you get away?
Was it rough?
Well, thank God you survived.
You were gone so long I was afraid you were dead. I thought I'd have to make some new babies.
I saved your old Harley for you.
- No.
- Yeah.
It's under a tarp in the back of the barn.
Maria?
Maria?
But you don't understand the movie, Al.
She died because she needed his love.
Do you know what I mean?
Al, please don't.
Don't go too far.
Baby, just let me put my hand there.
Al.
- Come on, why not?
- Please. Yes.
No! Baby, I know what you want.
Al, just listen.
Could you love me like that?
Like what?
Like the movie.
Through life and all the way into death.
Of course. Of course, baby.
Why do you even ask me that?
Now, come on. Just this once.
Oh, please, no. Jesus Christ!
What the...
I'm sorry.
Maria, it's...
Do you remember me?
I don't believe it!
Al, this is my friend Ivan Stuska.
I mean, Bibic.
Ivan, this is Colonel Al Griselli.
- Captain.
- Captain.
Hi, how you doing?
I guess I'd better be going.
Yeah, we'll see you around. Take care.
No.
You go, too.
Well, good night, everybody!
Good night.
Ivan!
I can't believe it's you.
Al, you know, when I came with my mother from Yugoslavia when I was little,
Ivan was the very, very first person I met, you know.
You can't believe what wonderful times we used to have.
Good to have you back.
So, this was your guy before the war, huh?
No.
No, it was a long time ago.
Oh, yeah. I was just a girl, you know.
- Real little.
- She's some dish now, huh?
Think I better go.
Carry on.
Will we see you soon?
So, you saw Maria. So?
She's fine. She's okay.
She's got a boyfriend.
He's a big cheese, a captain.
Like I always told you, she's too good for you.
Like her mother.
Oh, my God.
What eyes her mother had. Like they could turn you inside out and pick out the good from the bad.
You know, every time I looked into those eyes I felt pain.
Like she could see everything lousy I'd ever done in my life.
It's... To remember girls like that...
To Maria.
Now, that's what I call a real woman.
Mrs. Wynic.
Mrs. Wynic!
Come in.
Meet the greatest hero of the Second World War.
Oh, my God!
I heard you were home.
I couldn't wait another minute.
Look at this face!
How about a drink? Oh, no!
I meant to bring goodies.
I have cakes and fresh wild raspberries, but I was so excited! I just rushed right over. Oh, God!
I'll be back.
Oh, God.
Ivan, why don't you come home with me and help me bring over some special treats?
That's okay.
No, no, go.
Oh, no, you darling boy!
Now, listen, you tell me what he was like.
- Who? - Tell me the truth.
General MacArthur. Was he a nice man?
I'm so excited!
I can't believe you're here.
Come here.
This is a nice house.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
They tell me the oriental women are different.
You know what I mean?
Oh, don't tell me!
You'll make me blush.
You're such a man now.
A hero.
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I'm helpless.
The oriental women, they were so small, so...
Oh, no.
Unhealthy.
No!
Soldier, do you like to dance?
Oh, my God!
I mean... What are you doing?
Want to dance?
- Boogie, boogie, boogie! - Oh, God.
- I haven't danced in so long. - Oh, God! I was lonely.
A penny for your thoughts.
You seem far away.
I love a mystery.
What is it?
Do you know the sound of a head being cut off?
It's just a snap.
Just a snap. Like you break a match.
That's what the Japs use to do if they caught you trying something in the camp.
No warning.
One night it was raining. Rained all the time.
It was like having a kettle boiling in the room.
It was so wet you'd pick your finger... Pick your mold off between your fingers. I heard this screaming, and they had a guy pinned down for maybe 10 seconds, screaming like it was 100 years.
And... Then, through the air, the whoosh of the sword.
And then a crack, and a muffled plop like... Like a ripe melon falling in the mud.
And then nothing but the rain.
I'm lying on my mat in the mud and I think I hear something.
I look and I see it's a rat.
And I think it's a female, pregnant, because it's dragging its feet and leaving a trail of blood.
And then, as it passes me, I see that its...
Its fur has got blood on it. Just its fur, and its... Its belly is full, and it's dragging its feet.
And I know what it had for dinner.
After that, I...
After that, I... I married Maria.
No, in my mind, see?
Because then I didn't have to... I didn't have to see it anymore.
And everything I looked at was Maria.
Everywhere I looked.
All day I worked for her, all night I made love to her.
In your dream.
Yeah, in my dream.
Here he is.
A speech from our hero.
I...
I...
"I"?
You mean we, my son.
We made it.
We...
We all went over there. A lot of guys never...
I guess I was lucky. To... Home.
Al, can we dance now?
Do you mind? I'm just getting into this.
Yeah, tell us what happened.
So, then it's like this ball of fire from hell. It's coming straight towards us, right out of the sky.
- Joe, will you dance with me?
So, where was I?
- Ball of fire from...
Like a lightning bolt!
All four engines in flames.
Have I told you this one?
- Do you want to dance?
- No, I want to hear this.
- And I said...
- I want to go home. All right.
Do you mind? I am trying to tell this story.
Go on, Al.
So... I got a hold of the guy, pulled him out. The son of a bitch up and dies on me.
Al, won't you dance with me just once?
Sure. Hold that. I guess I'll stretch.
I was so...
You know.
This is great.
This is really great.
This is really something.
- Oh, yeah?
- Thank you, Harry.
I hate this party.
I hate everyone at this party.
- Me?
- Especially you.
Take me out of here.
Get your hands off me!
You two get the hell out and stay out.
Do you remember this place?
Of course.
But I never came here without you.
Yeah, it's a long way.
What?
I said it's a long way.
Hey, look, our chair's still here.
See?
I always said this was a magic place.
I just want to see something.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Just wait a second.
Wait a second.
Okay.
Okay, now.
Let me do this right.
Do you remember before I left for the war?
Do you remember?
Please.
I asked you to come here and meet me.
I'm sorry.
Well... Would you open it now?
Oh, Ivan!
Oh, they're beautiful. How precious.
Don't look.
It's over. The season.
For berries, I mean, you know.
So I only got these.
You're different.
Before you were the same.
But now you're different.
I'm older, you know.
Same eyes.
Same lips.
That's mine.
Same freckles.
Say more.
You know, I think I've loved you all my life. I just never realized it.
- When did you?
- Now.
Just now.
I bet when you were over there you never even thought about me, huh?
Let's go home.
Al will kill me.
- Hi, Al.
- Okay, that's it.
You, get out of here.
- Al, what do you think you...
- Get... Hey! Don't get on your high horse with me, baby, you understand?
- I want to know who the heck you think...
- Al, come on, please.
Just talk to me later.
We've been out all night...
You're damn right you've been out all night.
- I want to talk to you.
- So talk. You and me.
Ivan is my oldest friend, all right. So, if you have something to say to me, say it in front of him.
We're getting married.
But you never asked me.
I never asked you?
You stay out all night with this so-called friend of yours, right?
Was I engaged to you?
No, I guess you weren't.
I guess I just made a big mistake.
- Al... - You don't want to marry me?
Well, fine.
Good.
Damn you, baby.
And damn you, too, clown.
Al, wait!
Al!
My car!
Hey, you son of a bitch, you hit my car!
Anybody home?
Remind you of anything?
I made one just like that for your mother.
Of course, better wood before the war, but still...
And it's so beautiful.
Thank you.
I still have a good hand.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Well... Just a second. I'll be about through.
Just about through.
- Hello. - Just a second.
Hello!
How are you?
She's deaf as a post.
Come on.
Come over here.
You're a good girl.
You keep the house nice, you know, you take care of your babushka, but it's too much for you.
You need a good man.
Yeah. I was thinking that myself.
You ready to marry, then?
Some strong, healthy man from a good family with nothing to be ashamed of?
Established, not poor.
I want to marry Ivan.
Ivan?
My son Ivan?
You're too good for him.
Well, at least I'll have grandchildren.
Let me kiss you.
Listen, I'm almost your father.
Fathers don't need to ask their daughters for a kiss.
It's just that once. Before you become my daughter.
Oh, my God, those eyes.
Be exalted like unto Abraham, O bridegroom, and be blessed like Isaac and multiply like Jacob, walking in peace and keeping God's commandments in righteousness.
How many children we'll have?
One?
Two?
Three, four, five?
- Come here.
- Six, five?
Come here.
My train!
I'll be right out.
Come.
Love you.
What are you doing?
I want to look at you.
- No, don't. Don't.
- Yes.
I'm your husband.
I want to.
You're so beautiful.
Just relax, my beautiful.
Just let me.
Please, don't be scared.
I love you, every inch of you.
Please, my darling, just relax.
Just relax. Let me kiss you.
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
Come, my love. Come into me.
Come, come, come!
Come, come.
I want your baby.
I want your baby right away.
Right away.
I want your baby.
I want you.
I want you.
I want your baby.
I don't get it.
I'm so happy to be with you, but I just can't.
Is it...
- Am I making you...
- Oh, no.
I must have. I mean, I know.
I know you, you know... With other women and stuff, I know that.
Listen,
I love you so much, my whole body falls apart.
Could you love me less?
I don't want to love you less.
I don't want to.
It's true.
You really can see it.
You can?
Absolutely.
Well?
What was it like?
Wonderful.
Was there blood?
No?
Come on, Dave.
Get that dog out of here.
Ain't no dog.
What's that animal look like to you?
A pig.
I can triple your business in a week.
No joke, pal.
I did it in Chestertown.
I can do it here.
How come you left Chestertown?
Family problems.
Look, nobody brings in the ladies like me.
I got the face of Robert Taylor, the voice of Sinatra.
I got other tricks, too.
Bet you a quarter on this one.
Put salt on your peanuts. You'll have them drinking' like the ground after a summer drought.
So... I got the job?
No.
Yeah, well...
Got a club date in Philly, anyway.
Come on, Dave.
See you later, girls.
Bye, Harry.
You know, in some ways, I'm sorry the war is over.
They look so swell in their uniforms.
Especially Al.
Would you look at that!
No, no, no.
Never from you, cutie pie.
So, any requests?
Do you know Makin' Whoopie?
Mister, you can't do this.
You know, she's a nice girl, and this is a rotten thing to do. - Maria!
- Maria!
Name's Clarence Butts, cutie pie.
No if's, and's, or's.
I'm just passing through, but I'll be back for you.
Maria!
Hi, Rosie.
Watch it there.
Maria, come here.
I gotta tell you something.
You won't believe it. You won't believe it.
We're gonna get married!
- That's wonderful. - Isn't it?
- We need to drink to it.
Have a beer. - Yeah, take a beer.
- Ivan, isn't that great?
- Sure. Maria...
Chocolates.
- Did you smell my new perfume?
- Maria, take the chocolates.
It's from France.
- Take the chocolates.
Come on, the best. - Take 'em. Thanks.
Maria, you look so happy.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'm so happy.
You're so happy.
Everybody's happy.
A party, engagement party.
- Tell you about it tomorrow.
Okay.
- See you guys around. All right.
We're gonna live in Detroit!
Detroit!
Do you sleep, my darling?
Thanks, Harry.
Exhibit A, my friend.
Salty as the deep blue sea.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, pal.
Still got the guitar.
Bring the ladies in.
You won't regret it.
The guys pay to get them all drunk and mushy.
My music gets them hot and bothered and ready for the kill.
Not bad, Harry.
I don't know.
You play for tips?
Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.
- Get him a drink, Harry.
- Whiskey, up.
Stay there.
Hey, one condition.
You gotta get rid of that dog.
That look like a dog to you?
Well, to employment.
Talk to me later.
The name is Clarence Butts.
No if's, and's, or's.
Dave, time for you to give these up.
They already helped you score.
Here, take these.
Thanks.
Go out and get laid.
Takes the edge off.
I can't make love to her.
I can't make love to her.
You dreamed about her too long.
She lives in your dreams, not in your body.
I've been thinking, Ivan.
I've been thinking...
I've been thinking that it has to be my fault.
If you don't love me, I won't hold you.
I would rather lose you than destroy you, Ivan.
I know you don't love me.
And I don't care.
I love you, Maria.
You love me?
I'm so glad.
I'm so happy.
I wasn't sure, you know?
You don't feel well.
You poor thing.
- Oh, Maria...
- "I love you. " Yes, I know.
I know, my love, I know.
I feel so much better, you know. So much better.
I've been worried.
I've been so worried all this time. I'm so glad.
Let's just show how much we love each other and go to bed, huh?
My true love.
Here I am, it's your wifey. Just waiting, waiting for you.
Come on, let's go!
My poochie, what's the matter?
You drink too much, huh?
You stay up too late?
You love me too much, maybe?
Is that it?
- Please. - "Oh, please. "
"Oh, please. "
You love me?
You love me? So make love to me.
I know you can do it because I saw you.
I saw you with that filthy whore.
- Oh, Christ.
- Oh, yeah, you were doing it just fine.
Why were you spying on me?
Don't you dare.
Don't I dare?
Don't I?
You're crazy!
Are you crazy?
Put it down, Maria.
Okay. Fine.
Cut it off.
That's what you want.
Okay! Come on!
Come on!
- Stop it! - Come on.
- Do it! Do it! - Stop it!
Stop!
You're disgusting.
Oh, my God! Come on.
Do it!
I didn't even know if I was a man anymore.
Ivan.
Oh, boy.
Wait downstairs, will you?
Sure.
Here they are, the happy couple!
Throw your coats down.
Come right in.
Maria, this is my Uncle Pavel, this is my Aunt Martina, and this is Sal.
You're late, pal.
Stayed in bed too long.
She'll be waiting.
Remember me?
Don't you want to be with your husband?
No, I want to be with you.
Okay. Hold it!
No, could I please...
Could I please...
No, no, please.
Everyone,
I can hardly say what I have to say.
- I can't be engaged to Rosie.
It's the wrong thing.
What's this all about, Al?
Please, forgive me, Rosie.
I love Maria.
Rosie.
- You let that son of a bitch talk about her?
- Shut up, Father.
- You ought to tear him limb from limb.
Let's go.
Hey, they're gonna kill each other! - Oh, no. Oh, no.
Take it easy, now.
Everything's fine.
I'm sorry. That's the way it is.
But we can't help...
"But we can't help"?
"We"?
Okay. Did you hear me?
I said okay.
I said okay, sir.
Take her. - Take her!
- I'm leaving.
I'm flying out of here in a week.
What do you think, fly boy?
Do you think I don't have eyes?
Do you think I didn't see that in there?
I saw.
I saw.
So just do it.
Just do it.
Go get her.
Get her dresses, get her stockings. Get all her little doodads, her perfume and her goddamn little underwear and get the hell out of my life.
I really feel sorry for you.
What do you mean by that?
Because you don't know what you got.
- I don't know what I...
- You don't love her.
You listen to me.
I love her.
I'll show you how much I love her.
Ivan?
Where is Ivan?
He's gone.
Maria, please.
Maria, he's crazy.
Please, come with me to Detroit.
Please, I beg you.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Forgive me.
I don't love you.
I'm sorry.
You should have gone with him.
You know, when I came back home, I think everything went backwards.
It wasn't what I thought.
I...
I really hurt you.
I should've died in the war.
- Vera, look!
- Hey!
Hi.
Do you remember me?
You got married.
It doesn't seem to have hurt you any.
Do you remember me?
Better than I'd like to.
Hard to get, huh?
You remember me, all right.
Nobody sings like me.
You come to bed with me, I'll make your husband look like a warthog.
Feel that?
Not bad, huh?
You make me hungry.
You're like a flower stalk, but you won't break.
Just bend, flow with me like water.
Wind through the flowers.
- My husband.
- I don't care.
Next thing I know, she's moved away, she's become a model and dyed her hair blonde.
Can't you get anything straight, knucklehead?
I told you to move those gut drums over here, not hose the floor.
You been here three days already.
What do you got, bullshit for brains?
You don't really have to yell like that.
You shut up.
If your uncle didn't own this place, I'd fire your ass.
My uncle does own this place.
Just you fly right, or you can hit the road.
I know guys that'd kill for this job.
Jesus Christ, why do I put up with this crap?
I wouldn't let that horse's ass talk to me like that.
It makes you look like a worm.
Nice place you got here.
Thank you.
You wanna go out for a drink or something?
No, I can't.
My granny's sick. I can't leave her alone.
Hope you're feeling better.
- She's deaf.
- Deaf?
Where's your husband?
He's away.
Far away, or visiting-a-friend away?
Far away.
Far away.
Wait here a minute.
I wrote this especially for you.
I never felt my heart Until I looked into your eyes
I never dared to dream Until I looked into your eyes
I never thought the joys oflove Could touch a gypsy like me
Once alone and so free
Now my heart longs for you
I never felt the sun Until I looked into your eyes
I thought the race was won And then I looked into your eyes
I never needed anyone to sing The songs that I sing
Now the words only ring If I sing them to you
My love is there in your eyes
My soul is bare in your eyes
If I could gaze in your eyes ever more
It's the dream I live for You can open the door
I led a life of crime And then I looked into your eyes
My heart became a prisoner When I looked into your eyes
I fell beneath your gaze And felt as though my lies had been seen
All my sins became clean What a fool I ha ve been
My love is there in your eyes
My soul is bare in your eyes
If I could gaze in your eyes ever more
It's the dream I live for
You can open the door to love
That was really something.
A virgin?
Hot diggity dog.
- Hard to believe.
- Please.
What, are you kidding?
You hardly ever come across this kind of thing.
A lot of girls make the claim, but not that many can deliver the goods.
Look... Come with me.
I never asked nobody this.
It's just been me and Dave.
- Dave?
- My dog.
Come on.
We'll make a great team.
I can sing, you can wash my socks, whatever.
You're a class act all the way.
Squeaky clean, no mileage.
Leave me now.
Hey, I'm asking you.
I'm married.
Listen, sweetie, the guy's too dumb to screw his own wife, she might as well take off.
Where you off to?
Guess you want to shed a few tears, whatever.
Sure took it like a trooper, baby.
Hey, in there.
Hey. Go away.
- Don't you want to come with me?
- No.
What me, Clarence Butts?
Go away!
Some kind of woman.
I swear, I ain't never met no kind of woman who wasn't crazy.
You hear me?
- You're crazy.
- Get out of here!
Crazy woman!
That girl up there's got bats in her belfry.
You're all crazy!
Come on, come on!
You want the good-conduct medal?
The girls are ready to go!
Let me just finish this.
Hey, Kathy, what are you doing here?
I thought you wanted me to drop dead twice?
What am I supposed to do on the Fourth of July, sell a flag?
Let's just all be friends.
Why don't you be nice to her for once?
It wouldn't kill you.
Ivan, I want you to meet my new friend Joanie.
- She's Kathy's sister.
- Hi.
Hey, Kathy, how come you never told me you had a sister?
Well, you were never exactly interested in my family tree.
Ivan, come on, let's go.
Come on!
I hope I'm giving you enough room.
Oh, yeah. I got plenty of room.
You know, you remind me of somebody I used to know.
You're a dead man.
They both got you.
Come on.
Hello.
- I don't want to bother you.
- No. No.
I just wanted to tell you.
I can see.
And my granny died.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I just thought you would wanna know.
I'm having this baby.
I need...
I mean, the baby needs a father.
What do you need?
Money?
It's just...
He is not...
I mean, there is nobody.
Where's your boyfriend?
Detroit?
Let's go home.
I don't love you anymore.
I dreamed you up and I'm through with that.
I want to keep it that way.
Go home, Maria.
I will wait for you.
Don't bother.
You hear me?
I'm not coming back.
Don't wait for me.
You hear me?
Still stuck on her, huh?
Miss?
I thought you might be hungry.
Is there anything that I could do to help you?
No. Thank you.
I can triple your business in a week.
No joke, pal.
Did it in Minnesota, I'll do it here.
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
Hey, come here! Come over here!
I'll buy you a drink, no problem.
Hey, Bob! Bob, can you hear me?
Bob, could we have some food for this guy?
Bob's deaf!
You remember?
Brownsville?
Where's your dog Dave?
Dave got married.
Moved to Jersey.
Do you remember?
You saved my life.
I almost killed myself.
Frankly, pal, I've saved a lot of lives.
Refresh my memory.
You told me to get laid.
I was wondering where those got to.
- This is all just a big joke to you, isn't it?
- Did you say something?
Yeah.
I said I don't like watching you.
So don't watch.
Pass the salt, somebody.
Now, what is this?
You say this guy told you to get laid? That's how you think of it, isn't it?
"Get laid"?
- Harvey.
- No. You are sitting here with a very sweet girl.
What about the other one?
- He means me.
- I don't mean you, no offense. No.
I mean the other one.
Now, wait a minute.
What did I do?
Ivan, the girl who was having the baby.
I saw you. No, you got that all wrong.
No, I don't got nothing wrong!
I saw you and I saw her.
That girl was like an angel.
You just threw her away!
It wasn't my kid.
It was just her tough luck.
No!
I saw her and I heard her talk, and you're lying.
Nope.
Sorry.
Ivan, was it your baby?
Jesus!
Lie to me, but don't lie to her!
- You jerk, sit down!
- Damn you!
All right, all right.
You want to know about that girl? I'll tell you.
We lived together for a year or more.
Yeah. So what?
She made me crazy and she's crazy.
She's not crazy.
I know what crazy is.
You sure do.
You and her, you'd make a good pair. Well, thanks for the grub.
What seems to be the problem?
I didn't catch the gist of all that.
Harvey here is all upset over some crazy broad.
Some girl trying to pin down Ivan.
Women.
Tricky.
Yeah.
I met this girl... Looked like an angel.
Eyes like you wouldn't believe.
Skin like a baby's ass.
The whole bit.
But kind of shy, you know?
Like, always backing off and coming on.
Tells me she's married.
I knew I'd stick it to her. It's just a question of when, right?
So, one night she practically strips for me.
Peels off her little silk panties like she can't wait to get it in her.
So, I fuck her.
She's a virgin. And married!
You got that?
- You're kidding.
- No joke.
Loved it, anyhow.
Well, they all like it with me, sure.
The thing is, five minutes later, she kicks me out of bed.
You figure it?
Really something.
Crazy up here in the head, you know?
Poor bastard that married her probably couldn't get her to lie down.
But I did.
You want to know how?
Simple.
Listen.
I never felt my heart Until I looked into your eyes
I never dared to dream Until I looked into your eyes
I never thought the joys oflove Could touch a gypsy like me
Once alone and so free
Now my heart longs for you
I never felt the sun Until I looked into your eyes
I thought the race was won And then I looked into your eyes
I never needed anyone to sing The songs that I sing
Now the words only ring If I sing them to you
My love is there in your eyes
My soul is bare in your eyes
If I could gaze in your eyes ever more
It's the dream I live for You can open the door
I led a life of crime And then I looked into your...
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.
How'd you know I was here?
Maria.
- Maria?
She has a baby now.
She's okay.
All alone.
She's waiting for you.
Shame.
Want a drink?
You?
I'm dying.
Maria?
Maria.
It's me.
I'm sitting on your bed.
Do you like him?
I love him very much.
I love him very much.
Yeah.
I'm home, Maria.
We're making love, Maria.
We're making our own baby now.
ARMY PSYCHIA TRIST;
What is your name? Ivan Bibic, sir.
What are you thinking about right now?
Home.
Going home.
Plan? No. We thought about it, maybe.
Certain things are happening in Cuba. Art is politically committed.
And then ... You can't express things freely.
What do you think of Castro?
Tell me, what do you think of him?
I don't agree with his ideas.
Why not?
Because.
We were sorry for the ballet company.
CESAR BERMUDEZ NEW YORK
I was on the executive staff of the Cuban Revolutionary Government.
I worked on documentation and technical data for the ruling class, the group in power, about 300 people.
I kept them abreast of progress in technology and in the consumer society, so that our leaders could appear informed abroad.
Starting in 1965 in Havana University, and in other schools, a number of "moral purges" were carried out.
Not political purges.
The assumption was that political purges no longer existed.
That everyone was delighted with the revolutionary government.
A Communist Youth assembly was held. All students were summoned to it.
The Communist Youth Union brought a list of those to be purged.
Some who knew they were on the list didn't attend.
Others only found out at the assembly.
The humiliation during these meetings consisted in forcing all those present
to hurl every imaginable insult to each person being purged.
No one could escape it.
Everyone was warned that if he sided with a person being purged, he too would immediately be purged.
This moral persecution in Cuba has never been a matter of substance as people suppose.
It is purely formal, the simplest way to keep people distracted.
It's easy to persecute someone for the way he dresses or wears his hair. Nothing easier.
No ideology is needed, no logical buildup.
A lot of people left the university because of this.
Others couldn't.
People had to stand up and say
"What do you think of so-and-so?"
The person named stood there like a dunce. Then someone would say
"He talked and looked suspicious the other day."
Or "He shook my hand a little too long."
Absolutely idiotic things.
There were people who couldn't bear it, who were shocked and killed themselves.
Not only because of the public humiliation, but they were ashamed before their families, too
They had to go home and say "I was expelled because I was accused of being homosexual."
Some killed themselves.
Now in Madrid, I edit this little literary magazine.
I'm revising my books of poetry.
Were you interrogated when you were arrested?
Yes, by a soldier who told me with a sneer that I was in the Writers and Artists Union, and that artists, intellectuals, writers, are all faggots.
You're a faggot because you're a writer?
All fags!
I didn't say a word.
When you're in a repressive country, what can you say?
The man told me to walk, to walk around the room.
I was surprised, but I obeyed and walked around the room.
He said to walk with my back to him.
Then, with a lot of irony, he said
"You see?
We're going to make a man of you."
I suppose he meant that by changing my walk, they'd make a man of me.
Walking in a different way.
from the way I walked ... he could see ...
Something dangerous in me!
RAFAEL DE PALET MIAMI
They thought dyed hair was homosexual.
I reported for so-called military service.
That was a trick.
JORGE ROMET NEW YORK
UMAP stands for Miltary Units Aiding Production.
The government called people up as if for the army.
Those listed by the police as opposing the government
or as homosexuals or Jehovah's Witnesses, or whatever, were sent to these camps.
Nobody knew exactly what the camps were.
People thought it was for the army, some said they were concentration camps, but no-one was sure.
HECTOR ALDAO NEW YORK
We were called to the Botanical Gardens in Havana.
At dusk, we left by bus for Camaguey province.
We didn't know where we were going.
The trip took 8 or 10 hours.
We couldn't stop to phone our families or give our destination. We were prisoners.
Some of the mothers and families were hysterical.
When the buses left people threw themselves on them.
One woman held on to a bus until she fell off.
The summons surprised me, I didn't have a record, no arrests, no trouble.
Later I learned that in the boarding house where I lived there was a man, now also in exile in New York, who denounced me to get my room!
He had a brother, a soldier, who was high up in the secret police.
He sent me to the UMAP so he could have my room!
As soon as we got in, the buses were sealed.
We couldn't get out to attend to our needs
People had to piss, shit, and everything in the rear of the buses.
It stank horribly all night.
When we stopped, we'd call to the villagers for water, because we were given nothing.
From the start, we were mistreated.
Even in the stadium where we arrived at 4 a.m.
The way people were treated was typical of a fascist regime.
There were 12,000 to 15,000 people.
Searchlights surrounded the stadium.
Pinochet copied this from Cuba.
We were the first to do this.
It was called rehabilitation for opponents of the regime and other social undesirables.
Vagrants, homosexuals, prostitutes...
The camps were enclosed with barbed wire. At first, it was electrified.
But this aroused such protest, that they sometimes cut the current by day and restored it at night.
No-one was sure if it was on all the time.
That's what they wanted us to think.
So we never knew if it was on or off.
At the gate you read "Military Unit 2269"
And there was a huge sign that said
"Work will make you men."
That quote of Lenin recalled the line that Salvatore Quasimodo said was at the entrance to the camp at Auschwitz.
"Work will make you free."
The food was really horrible.
There was no rice. They said the boat hadn't come from China.
We rose at 6 a.m. for drill and gymnastics.
The idea was to make us produce, as if we were slaves, unskilled labourers.
They assigned quotas we had to fill.
If we didn't, we were subject to reprisals.
They said the aim was to make us communists.
We got daily political indoctrination.
It was laughable.
The speaker knew nothing of politics or anything else.
He used Konstantinov's Marxist-Leninist manual, which is an abomination.
It was issued by the Soviet Academy of Science, and says everyone's a fascist.
From T.S. Eliot to Plato: all fascists!
Their alphabetical system's just as bad.
"M" as in Marxism.
"R" as in Raul. "C" as in Castro.
The language was very elementary, like a catechism.
We got no clothes, no shoes, people were barefoot.
Fidel Castro, with typical bravado, came to inspect the camps.
We were ripping out grass with our hands. Around 5 p.m.
we saw a convoy of jeeps.
Behind them, oddly, were two trucks, full of chickens.
They say he eats a lot of chicken.
Then the prisoners began to shout insults at him.
As usual, he didn't come near us.
He went by in his jeep like a grand duchess inspecting her serfs.
But I've seen him go near people.
Not near UMAP people.
He loves to stick labels on people, as he did on the Mariel exiles.
He saw us as social plague-bearers.
So he went by like the grand duchess he thinks he is.
There was a group of Jehovah's Witnesses.
The military command tried everything to make them join in working in the fields.
Their religion barred any compromise.
I saw the soldiers cut a boy with a bayonet.
Slashing his chest.
The bayonet hadn't entered his body, but gave him a wound.
From then on, I grew more and more furious and deeply upset.
My experiences in the UMAP were very bitter.
Full of ...
I'd rather not remember those days.
I doubt if it's better now.
Nothing ever improves there.
All you get are variations on the same theme.
We were in line in front of a restaurant. A State Security police car arrived, we were forced to get in.
They didn't want to look at our ID papers.
They took us 150 metres, to a spot alongside the Hotel Capri.
It looked like a movie set, searchlights everywhere
and dozens of cops blocking the sidewalks, arresting people.
Many passersby were arrested violently. If they tried to resist, they were clubbed.
Others ran away and escaped.
We were taken to buses hidden in a nearby park, ten or twelve of them, I'd say.
We were crammed into the buses and taken to State Security HQ.
There, we were classified into three groups.
One was the "hippies", this included those who liked pop music, the Beatles and had parties, like all kids.
If their hair was long, that was the style then, or if they wore loud shirts they were considered "hippies".
Then came the homosexuals.
Others couldn't be classifed in either group.
A term was invented for them, "Improper Conduct".
This was indefinable. It could fit anyone.
The work was exhausting.
We had to get up before sunrise.
Usually, we got back to camp at dusk.
We worked in the fields, planting tobacco,
cutting sugar cane.
One of the worst chores came later, when we were sent to the Zenea sector.
We had to cut aroma bushes. They're full of thorns. There were huge fields of them that we had to uproot.
When I got back to camp, I had to pick thorns out of my ankles and feet.
Here are some drawings that show, roughly,
what the camp was like.
Here's the barbed wire surrounding the camp.
The watchtowers.
One at every corner.
There's the entrance.
These were the sheds used as dormitories.
Here are the punishment cells, when someone did something considered wrong.
They were small.
About twenty of them.
There were no beds.
You slept on the floor.
The imperialists can't forgive the dignity, the integrity, the courage, the ideological firmness, the spirit of sacrifice, the revolutionary spirit of the Cuban people.
They can't forgive us for staging a socialist revolution
under the very nose of the United States!
After the death of soldier Pedro Ortiz Cabrera, Cuban guards were withdrawn from the Peruvian embassy.
As expected, the embassy filled up with 'special guests'.
They're like wild animals.
I've never seen anything like it.
To think we'd see this in our country.
Like wild animals, I tell you.
Out with them!
NOW
Get rid of the parasites!
Antisocial scum!
IT'S TIME FOR ACTION
BY THE PEOPLE
You've waited 20 years for this, what's 20 minutes more?
How many more?
Five?
We've wanted to come for 21 years.
We couldn't, with the terror there.
You can't get out.
How long were you at El Mariel?
Eleven days, with no food.
They took our money, our cigarettes, set dogs on us.
German shepherds?
Police dogs.
In a concentration camp called "El Mosquito".
Is that near El Mariel?
3 kilometres away.
The homosexuals I knew in Fort Chaffee, spoke of themselves as men 'with a flaw'.
A 'weakness'.
They criticized themselves, put themselves down.
The way a Jew in Arthur Miller's "Incident in Vichy" said:
"I would like not to be guilty" instead of "I wish I weren't a Jew."
Society imposes a negative criterion on a human element that we accept to the point where we live as others want us to.
Cuban homosexuals brought this self-image with them
Some were very strong, very muscular, like truck drivers or boxers ...
Having this concept of machismo they brought from Cuba.
they tried to deny their homosexuality.
Sometimes, to attract attention, and to reinforce assumed identities,
they acted out various versions of their self-image.
For example, they used very histrionic gestures.
LUIS LAZO
Sometimes I'm ashamed to say it:
I was in jail 17 times in Cuba.
Why?
For no reason.
Because I wore pants they thought were too tight.
For nothing, really.
In Cuba, being dressed as I am now.
was impossible.
I couldn't, because they thought it was shocking, a public display.
That could cost me 3 to 6 months in jail.
Were you given a trial?
Sure, always.
In cuba, with people like me, they always found a reason to hit us.
They wanted us to disappear.
Tell us about the makeup.
It happened to a lot of people, and often to me.
I hung around the theatres and places in the Prado district.
A lieutenant - a woman - made it her business to hound people like me.
She'd pick up a scrap of paper, rub our faces with it, put it in a folder, and give the folder to a judge,
With no other proof, he'd give us 6 months to a year.
What was on the paper?
Face powder.
CARACOL
There they'd say, "We've just come to search".
Who can object?
Everyone opens the door.
It's not like here, where they need a warrant.
They flash a card and act like they own the place.
All Cubans are scared.
You wear new clothes and a neighbour says,
"He's not working, how can he afford it?"
Or, "New furniture - how'd he pay for it?"
You buy a chickent to raise it.
"He must be doing black magic."
You live in fear of rumours, of sudden panics.
We went to an Afro-Cuban religious ceremony, a group of us on a bus.
There was a married couple.
that ogled us and sneered,
"Look, he's plucked his eyebrows."
I was wearing jeans and a low-cut sweater.
She had it in for me, so we were arrested.
If they arrest their quota, they can buy a TV, a refrigerator.
You can imagine how they act on patrol. "That one - slug him!"
"El Combinado" is a prison made up how to say ... "A building" ...
I can't find the word ... with several floors.
I was there.
Killers on one floor, gays on another, thieves on another ...
Were criminals and political prisoners put together?
Politicals were in another building.
Were you treated like the politicals?
No, it was different.
With us it was a little more...you know
We had cosmetics.
We made dresses out of sheets knowing that if we were caught it meant another month inside.
But you know how we are.
We'd tear sheets and mattresses to dress up for a party.
We had parties in jail and took our beatings.
Could you get favours from the guards?
I managed only once.
What happened?
A guard fell in love with me.
He got me out cleaning the corridor.
"Stay out," he said, "and be a nurse", so I looked after people.
"Tomorrow you'll clean the place." He always got me out when he was on duty.
He sent me love letters.
Did you take refuge in the Peruvian embassy?
No, I was taking food to a friend there.
I was arrested on the way.
I spent two weeks in jail.
Around 4:30 or 5:00 one morning, the warden called us together.
He said that under a new law, all those caught near the embassy had to go to the USA.
Did you resist leaving?
I was scared.
Why?
I didn't know anyone here, what would I do alone?
I couldn't speak English.
But they made us go. I kept saying "I don't want to go!".
A guard who called me Fifi told me:
"Get out, Fifi, it's going to get worse for you people."
He insisted so much that I went, no matter how much I cried.
I was OK on the boat, But landing terrified me. I said, "Fidel was right!"
I saw all those cops in Key West.
They were there to protect us, but I didn't know that then.
Seeing them terrifed me.
"Fidel was right, it's an island, they'll kill us!"
There's a saying:
"If you don't love your country, you don't love your mother. "
I may not love Cuba.
I don't miss it.
My name is Reinaldo Arenas, I was born in Cuba 40 years ago.
I spent almost a full year in El Morro.
The prison was closed in 1979.
It was too shocking, that one of Cuba's most sordid prisons was in Havana at the entrance of the port where all the ships passed it. It was even a tourist attraction.
But near it was La Cabana, another prison, built by the Spanish in the 16th or 17th century. It's one of the most sinister political prisons in Cuba, because there, they shoot people.
No-one was shot in El Morro then.
When anyone was sent to La Cabana we felt we'd never see them again.
If they were transferred there, they'd be shot.
Cuba's biggest prison is the Combinado del Este.
It's kind of a prison-city. with many multi-story buildings.
It can hold 100,000 prisoners.
We built it ourselves as prison labourers.
After I finished my term, I was subject to a "rehabilitation program".
This means having to disavow the life you lived before prison, swearing you won't defy the system in any way. You're even sexually "reeducated".
To complete my "rehabilitation", I was put to work at several building sites as a mason's assistant.
These were buildings in the Flores district, where Soviet technicians lived.
When I got out of prison I went home to get my manuscripts.
I couldn't get in.
When you're sent to prison, your home and everything in it, is confiscated by the government.
I was homeless.
The door was sealed so I couldn't get in.
One manuscript, the last, I'd salvaged before my arrest. I'd hidden it under the roof, wrapped in nylon
How was I going to reach it?
I no longer had access to the house.
One night, while some friends stood watch, I climbed on to the roof.
The manuscript was gone.
They'd even searched under the roof.
When I got out of prison, my reputation abroad was at its peak.
My books had been translated into many languages.
Yet in Cuba, I was a non-person.
I didn't have a typewriter, or a room to write in.
I lived like a bum, sleeping in a different friend's house every night.
People who asked for me were told I didn't exist. I became a character out of Orwell, an 'unperson'.
The novelist J.N. Oropeza, has published in Spain and Venezuela. On a visit to Cuba, he saw the Union of Writers and Artists
He told Nicolas Guillen and other officials that he wanted to meet me.
They said there was no such writer.
They showed him their list of writers, I wasn't on it.
He went to Casa de las Americas. An official said, "You're wrong. There's no writer in Cuba named Reinaldo Arenas."
Finally, he saw Lezama Lima, who fearfully took him outside and said,
"Don't ask questions about Arenas."
"He's in jail or just getting out."
When Fidel Castro speaks, even to proclaim laws that condemn people, those people must go to the Plaza de la Revolucion and applaud those laws.
The very laws that will sentence us to hard labour. We have to approve and applaud.
Everyone has to pretend.
We all depend on the State.
The State gives us work.
The State can put us in jail, or send us to college, or get us promotions in our job.
All those insane laws drive a person to paranoia.
Laws like the ones against "extravagance" or "vagrancy", or "ideological diversionism."
Laws for the sexual protection and development of the family.
If you try to leave Cuba, you run into another law covering "illegal" exits.
If you try to swim to freedom, or stow away on a plane, you're leaving the country illegally and you get 4 or 5 or 6 years in jail.
It's a wig and a woman's dress.
You stand there.
I must get rid of all this.
If Fidel had seen you in Cuba he'd have sent you to Miami as a public menace.
If only it had been that easy.
It took me 15 years of tomato picking to get out.
Aren't you exaggerating?
That's inflation for you.
Sit down, make yourself at home.
This meeting is so important, even French TV came to film it.
How are things at the White House?
Too many problems.
He only holds on to his job because of me.
I defended him in the Politburo.
I said "Okay, he's mongoloid."
"Retarded, fat, and ugly."
"But he's not a bad guy."
The Committees for the Defence of the Revolution have proven to be very effective
in fighting the revolutionary enemy,
I mean, counter-revolutionary, on every front of the Revolution.
They are groups of repression, one for each block, and they play a precise role in the repressive apparatus.
There are neighbourhood committees, that are one level higher.
They're all interconnected.
Still higher, there are national committees.
It's all geared into the machine.
I see it as a way of making people police themselves, without the regime brass having to intervene.
Imagine your life controlled. programmed from 9 to 5.
And then from 5 to 7 you do this, 7 to 9, this, then to bed,
If you're not on committee duty.
It starts in the cradle.
You sing "1, 2, 3, like Che we will be."
In grade school your whole education is political. In high school too.
At 14 they test your political aptitude.
To enter the Communist Youth Unions, then the Party.
That's the route.
It's all laid out for you.
Did any of you belong to the Communist Youth Union?
Yes, I did.
I was 14.
My name was put forward.
My father and mother, had never discussed politics with me.
Later, I understood why.
If I had to grow up under that system, it was better for me to be part of it, than to become a dissident.
That's how Cuban families protect their kids.
"You can't fight the course of things."
"It's better for the kid to become a Communist than to be in jail."
At the time I was 14, they made it sound like a gift.
something important, my first achievement in life.
That's how it seemed to me.
The Cuban social system is racist, Social equality is non-existent.
A cop on a lonely street who sees a black guy, doesn't react as he would to a white guy.
He'll arrest him.
Cops have a fascist mentality.
To them, blacks are criminals.
In most of the world having long hair means you're a leftist
In Cuba, long hair meant you're pro-American!
One day, coming out of the movies, I saw the police arresting people.
For no particular reason. "Grab that one!"
When they arrest you they never tell you why.
El Principe still existed then.
"The Prince's Castle"
One of the oldest prisons in Havana.
I spent a week there.
First, my hair was shorn off.
It was done in front of hundreds of people.
To humiliate me.
I did have rather long hair.
I stayed there a week.
I wasn't told why.
My family couldn't find out, either.
When I got out, I was summoned by the judge.
I think I was accused of "extravagant behaviour".
On the day of my hearing there were no witnesses, no jury, only one military judge.
I didn't deserve a week in jail just because I had long hair.
When those people took refuge in the Peruvian embassy, the regime mixed in common criminals so it looked like those who wanted to leave were all delinquents and drug addicts.
So people wouldn't know that everyone wanted to leave Cuba.
It's the only country in the world where in less than 24 hours
10,000 people asked for political asylum!
Another first: the only country in the world where a man tried to flee hiding in the wheel of an airliner.
They were trying to humiliate the people who wanted to leave by saying they were prostitutes and so on,
You had to take it and shut up.
What does it mean, anyway?
If after 20 years of revolution, of "exemplary politics", of what they call "the defense of man", of "culture" and "morality",
If after 20 years of that regime, you open the door a crack and 100,000 people leave in a few months,
And if all those people are delinquents, then it's your fault: you created them.
I'm the same age as the Revolution.
We were all born around then. If we're all delinquents, who's to blame?
That system creates delinquents.
It's obvious, you have to be blind not to see it.
To the founder, who rendered powerful and invincible this army of organised people, the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution.
To our beloved Fidel!
FELIX HERNANDEZ I worked 10 years for Cuba-Tours from 1970 to 1980, as a tourist guide, especially for Italians.
For Italian group tours sent by agencies.
Most of them returned to Italy impressed by what they had seen.
A tourist coming to Cuba is shown a false view, a prefabricated image of Cuban reality.
From the moment he lands at the airport, and takes a luxury bus to a large Havana hotel, a tourist gets to see only well-kept streets.
Then he visits the cathedral, the heart of the old town of Havana, with its convents and churches.
But if he strays even 200 metres from the planned route, he'll see that Havana is a disaster area.
Tourists are under surveillance by guides, taxi drivers, and other employees the moment they reach their hotel.
A tourist is welcomed by the official of Cuba-Tours.
He is told this official will take care of his needs if he wants an address or phone number, or to meet anyone.
This official will help him.
In this manner, the official controls what the tourists do.
They're told to use the hotel's taxis because they're cheaper and give better service and not to use just any taxi.
When a tourist gets into a hotel taxi, the driver asks him for his hotel card and room number.
He takes him to the desired address.
But later, the driver informs the Cuba-Tour official where the tourist went.
That's how all unscheduled visits are monitored.
On the way to Jibacoa Beach, about 75km from Havana, you visit the Jibacoa collective farm.
Tourists are shown how the peasants live.
It's embarrassing! People like myself had to do it many times.
You say: "This is how peasants live now".
"Here are their apartments, here's the school, the child-care centre".
"Now you can visit any home you want and see their living conditions".
The bus always stops in front of the same building.
The tourists are told they can go in.
They're a bit embarrassed to burst in, but they're told it's OK.
There are make-believe peasant women, who invite them in.
They do this for every group.
In these well-furnished apartments, They offer the tourists coffee and fruit, things that are rationed and scarce in Cuba.
All over Cuba, near tourist centres and hotels, you find people walking around, mostly very young men and women, who offer the tourists black market currency rates, or offer sex, in exchange for a pair of jeans, a sweater,
And all of this is tolerated by the police.
Or it wouldn't be possible.
I knew these people by sight.
All of us guides did.
We knew where they hung out to do their trading, but the police never cracked down on them.
So you wonder who they were?
ELAINE DEL CASTILLO
When the new regime came in, many women took advantage of the great power of the new leaders, to obtain
housing and jobs.
What it amounted to was a form of prostitution, "Give me this and I'll pay you for it."
Many of these women later recycled themselves into the 'new prostitution', living in good neighbourhoods, protected by powerful friends.
It was a short step to become full time prostitutes.
This was the top level of prostitution restricted to the diplomatic corps and visiting VIPs.
There's another level of prostitution: young girls who cater to foreign technicians in Cuba, and to tourists around the hotels.
Many of these girls are controlled by the secret police.
In a way, the State has become the new pimp. in these new types of prostitution for diplomats, technicians and tourists.
It's undeniable, it's pimping
These women can only ply their trade, because the state, i.e. the police, allows it.
There's yet another level of prostitution, the most pathetic in Cuba. It involves very young girls and is the most degrading.
Little value is placed on Cuban women.
Her price is a pair of nylons, or three packs of foreign cigarettes.
A pack of cigarettes now costs 20 pesos in Cuba. So three packets is 60 pesos.
But the real value of three packs is nothing.
No woman in the world, outside of the communist countries, would sell herself so cheaply.
It's the lowest form of prostitution. The State can't benefit from it.
So it's repressed.
These women are very independent.
And the police aren't interested in the information they provide so they're harrassed.
They get arrested, just as punishment.
There's no pretence of "rehabilitation".
Nothing's done to help them.
They go to jail, the sentence is always the same.
Six months and one day.
They get out and after a while they're back inside.
GARCIA RAMOS REINALDO
During a trip to Bulgaria, Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, said he found that the streets very "clean".
i.e. free of "antisocial elements".
He asked how they'd done it.
He was particularly concerned about homosexuality.
He was given a reply instantly.
"We have a special camp"
"for antisocial elements"
"Especially the homosexuals you're so concerned about".
He decided to set up such camps in Cuba.
Were they only for homosexuals?
Not solely.
But they were the main target.
They suffered the most, because in Cuba they were easy to spot.
Anyone who displayed "extravagant attitudes"
was immediately sent to a UMAP.
What was meant by "extravagant attitudes"?
Effeminate mannerisms.
Only 'manly' homosexuals were tolerated.
Many Cuban political leaders are such people.
They speak with deep voices.
They manage to hide the truth.
It's a serious problem in a macho country like Cuba.
That's how many gay men saved their skins and now hold important political positions.
Especially in the police, where there are many 'manly' homosexuals.
It started with Raul Castro's trip to Bulgaria.
Later came a Czech came to Cuba, who wanted to turn homosexuals into men, and lesbians into women.
With rather complicated tests, no?
It was right out of Pavlov!
They tried to stimulate their libidos by showing them pictures of naked women,
On the other hand, when they were shown pictures of a man with an erection, they were induced to vomit.
Cuban homosexuals soon got wise to the system.
They pretended to be excited by the women.
"What sexy broads!"
And when the man with the erection appeared,
"How could I ever look at that!"
Meanwhile, they had sexual adventures with the camp's military personnel!
This Cuban trait of laughing at serious matters, that we in Cuba call "jodedor", and which in English, could be translated as a gift for mockery, this trait enabled Cubans to endure some of the misery.
But the misery was real.
What really irritated Cuba's new masters were these men.
Lesbians excited them.
Nothing so appeals to the primitive Cuban mind as two women in bed.
And they seem innocent, as they have no 'weapons'.
The 'scientific' aspect reminds one of Hitler's Germany, no?
Sartre once said to us,
"In Cuba, there are no Jews,"
"but there are homosexuals."
Those in power always find some element of society that antagonizes them.
Furthermore, homosexuals - this is my own unscientific opinion - are people who always question the world they live in.
They're by nature active, they're never sad.
On the other hand, heterosexuals tend to be melancholic, they get over-attached to things, say, a landscape, an old shoe.
It's strange, but true!
I don't know why.
They can't really adapt to new ways of life. Like going into exile.
Were you scared of being mistaken for a homosexual?
I couldn't care less.
It would have added another human dimension. It might be an enrichment.
Virgilio Pinera said to me:
"You lack the imagination to be homosexual".
"Maybe one day ..."
It doesn't bother me, it's not my problem.
They even arrested on Guanabo Beach, far from Havana, the writer Virgilio Pinera, just because of his outward appearance. Because he looked effeminate.
The "Night of the Three P's" had serious consequences.
Virgilio Pinera, thanks to the influence of Franqui and Edith G. Buchaca, who was a Communist official then, was released the same day he was arrested.
But he couldn't get back into his house.
Seals had been placed on the door, by the Ministry of Interior, as if the house had been inhabited by an enemy of the Revolution.
How did it happen?
He was denounced by the Defence Committee opposite his house.
Virgilio told me that, in fact, the head of the Committee wanted to get his hands on his house.
That's nothing new.
It's happened often before.
German Jews, who had mansions, that the Nazis wanted, ended up in Auschwitz.
During the Spanish Inquisition, Jews and Moors who had desirable houses, were denounced as heretics.
But in this case, the victim was an important writer: Virgilio Pinera.
He was very well known, a writer of importance, not only in Cuban literature, but in all Spanish-American literature.
Many weren't as lucky as he was.
They didn't have influential friends.
They weren't at the centre of Cuban culture.
I remember the night he was freed.
He was brought to your place, I remember a frail man who was crying.
Virgilio never got over it.
That night he insisted on sleeping at my place.
Miriam Gomez and I had only one bed.
We put the mattress in the next room so he could sleep on the boxspring.
The strangest thing is that soon our apartment was filled with homosexuals who were afraid to go home.
Next morning, to reach the kitchen, I had to step over lots of our friends sleeping on the floor.
You worked at the paper "Revolution". That protected them?
It was like being in the government.
So they found temporary asylum in my apartment.
One evening, at the paper "Revolution", I got a phone call advising me that Virgilio Pinera had been arrested.
I called the Presidential Palace.
They said not to worry.
It was Operation P.
I went straight there.
The cabinet was in session.
Ramiro Valdes, the Security Chief, said to me,
"You've come about your friend Pinera?"
I said, "Not just about him."
"About the thousands of people you've arrested unjustly"
"Throughout the country."
Then Valdes said:
"Look, a defender of gays."
Knowing Cuban prejudices, I think if I've ever acted with courage, it was then.
I answered "If you'd read about Hitler,"
"and others who peresecuted homosexuals"
"You'd realise the worst persecutors were homosexuals themselves."
Ramiro Valdes reacted furiously.
Escalante, the Party secretary, told me that they'd consulted other socialist countries and followed their advice.
In China, homosexuals were shot.
Elsewhere, they got long jail terms.
In 1964, the UMAP concentration camps were opened.
My Italian friends Valerio Riva and Giangiacomo Feltrinell, with whom I was writing a book on Castro, spoke of the problem to Fidel.
It was a heated discussion.
At one point, I asked Fidel,
"What would you do with your beloved Julius Caesar?"
Fidel greatly admires Julius Caesar.
"You'd shoot him, too?"
JUAN GOYTISOLO, SPANISH WRITER IN PARIS
In fact, Fidel's defence of his beloved Julius Caesar wasn't very brilliant.
Caught off his guard, Fidel argued that he was creating a new country, that he needed virile men, warriors, athletes, with no mental flaws.
Homosexuals could be blackmailed.
They also set a bad example for youth.
He admitted people were being persecuted. that UMAP camps had not only gay men, but also dissidents and religious sect members, and that they'd been physically maltreated.
During this discussion, its sole consequence, was that we had to abandon our book on Fidel. He agreed to disband the UMAP.
It's true, the UMAP was disbanded.
But just as UMAP had a forerunner in Operation P, it also had sequels.
Like the 1971 law against vagrancy and other persecutions.
These were but crude beginnings.
They realised their mistake.
It wasn't that they'd arrested innocent people, because the others were innocent too, the mistake was in not arresting all of them.
Padilla told us that the methods of repression used by the Cuban Revolution were patterned on Bulgarian methods that Raul Castro had learned during a visit there.
Maybe it was a Bulgarian virus! They were all obsessed with homosexuality when visiting communist bloc countries.
Ramiro Valdes, Minister of the Interior, went to China and asked to meet the Mayor of Shanghai.
Why did Valdes want to meet him?
Shanghai had always had a large homosexual population. dating back to imperial China, even under Chiang Kai-shek.
It was the capital of westernized China, it had very free morals.
As opposed to Peking, the cloistered capital.
So he met the Mayor of Shanghai,
He asked him how they had solved the homosexual problem.
The mayor replied through an interpreter.
"There are no homosexuals here."
"You no longer have any here?"
"We took advantage of a traditional festival"
"Where homosexuals gathered in a park,"
"on the bank of a river."
"Party officials went there carrying clubs to eliminate the problem once and for all."
"They clubbed them and threw them into the water."
"The bodies were carried downstream"
"as a grim warning. It was the end of homosexuality in Shanghai."
Valdes reported this on his return from China in 1963.
He found it a brutal solution, but the Cubans were looking for a solution to the problem, too.
It's all tied up with Spanish machismo, so apparent in Castro.
Everything he does is aimed at showing how macho he is. A superman, a supermacho.
He doesn't cross a room like most mortals.
He has to do it in three strides. Where most people would need eight.
But that's not all of it.
The persecution of gays and lesbians, and those who lived the good life in Havana was persecution of dissidents.
Homosexuals deviate from the bourgeois norms. Communists endorse conventional couples.
Marriage between a man and a woman.
Homosexuality threatens all that, Hence totalitarian states fear it.
Homosexuals were persecuted in Russia and in Hitler's Germany.
This bourgeois ideal of family, of marriage, wasn't practiced by Castro himself.
He didn't feel obligated to get married.
He always kept to himself.
The Cuban army is full of generals and colonels.
Castro is neither.
He's the "maximum leader".
He has about eight other titles but never appears as General Castro.
He's a leader who is married to the Revolution. Married to Cuba.
So he didn't have to marry a woman.
Bye!
Study hard!
HAVANA, 1971 I led an army in the war, and in a war, an army must be commanded, with rigid discipline, and total authority.
We won the war.
At the end of the war, I had great personal power.
I didn't use our victory or the Revolution to acquire more power.
SUSAN SONTAG, NEW YORK
I've worked tirelessly, from the start, to form a leadership team, a collective leadership, to create a party, and institutions
in which I placed all my personal influence, all my power.
I analyse and discuss collectively with comrades who command respect, and authority and revolutionary fame, the problems of the party and the country.
The delegates who agree with the nominations to the presidency, and for other labour-committee officers, raise your credentials.
Against?
Abstentions?
It's in the jails that people are the best informed about what's going on in Cuba.
Every day, people land in there from all over the island, from all social classes.
Cubans you meet on the street, live in constant and obsessive fear of going to jail.
When they get there, they say the things they're scared of saying outside.
While I was in a punishment cell in the Combinado del Este prison, they brought in a kid aged 12, called Robertico.
He told me his story.
He was a kid like any other.
One day in the street, he saw a gun on the seat of an open car.
For a gag, he aimed it at the sky and fired a shot.
The owner of the car showed up, an officer of the Ministry of Interior.
He beat up Robertico and took him to a police station.
He was sentenced to jail until his majority.
They sent him to Combinado del Este.
Despite his youth, he was put with common criminals who'd been years in jail, men who were morally and mentally sick.
A few days later, five of them raped the kid.
He was so maimed physically that his life was in danger.
He was sent to the prison hospital. When he was discharged a few weeks later,
Robertico's file was stamped: "Homosexual".
So he was moved into the homosexual wing.
He was so small, he could slip between the bars.
One day he escaped to watch cartoons on the guards' TV set.
To punish him, they put him in solitary, in the cell next to mine and that's how I heard his story.
In the evenings, the breeze made the light bulb sway in the corridor, and cast a shadow in his cell.
That scared him.
At the same time, every day, he'd start crying for his mother.
I still hear his voice:
"Get me out of here, I want to see my mama".
The guards, annoyed by his crying, threw buckets of water at him.
One of the soldiers bayonetted him.
Lieutenant Mejias, who was in charge of the wing, forbade using the bayonet, because the boy was so frail.
After that they beat him with a braided rope.
That this kid was sent to jail seems incredible, but in Cuba it's common.
There are prisons for minors throughout the island.
In Havana, the Guines and Jaruco prisons, plus two concentration camps for minors,
"New Life" and "Rainbow", as well as the Batabano prison, and one in the Mulgoba district.
But in some cases, kids are placed in adult jails.
I was beaten on the head.
The scars are still there. You can still see on my hands where I was tortured.
For years I was in solitary, like so many others, in cells where there was no sunlight, and no electric light.
We got routine beatings twice a day. They'd go from cell to cell. For years, I got no mail from my family, or visits, or medical care.
I was under constant pressure. and was mentally and physically maltreated by the guards.
This is common practice in Cuba.
The Revolution can't be accused of having killed one citizen,
or having tortured a single prisoner.
Tell me of any other examples of this in history.
My name is Ana Maria Simo.
I was an idealist.
I think I still am.
Despite the government's cultural policies, despite ... the conventional morality that they had enforced.
I considered myself to be a true communist.
The true heir to Marx, Engels and the others.
The party chiefs were ignorant bourgeois to me.
That's why I kept on being a revolutionary, despite my disagreement.
I thought there was a struggle between the more radical people like myself, and the petty-bourgeois like Castro.
and that, eventually, the Cuban revolution would be radicalized.
Then one day, there was a knock on my door at 4 a.m.
I lived with my grandmother, she opened the door and three men came in.
They said they were State Security and that I had to go with them.
So I did.
I was put in a room. with 30 other women.
where there wasn't even a toilet.
They claimed these women were lesbian.
Most were naked, ate with their hands, had to defecate on the floor, and screamed all night.
The place was roughly one third the size of this room.
And there were close to forty women in it.
I spent the night clinging to the bars of the cell, crying, terrified of what might happen to me in there.
A luckily, a black woman of around 50, who'd been in there for 25 years, for killing her husband,
consoled and protected me.
She told me that like all the other women, I was in there by mistake.
A mistake!
How often I heard that!
After five days, I was taken at night to some man's office.
This was Miguel Fernandez, the director of all prisons and penitentiaries in the Havana area.
He questioned me every night for a week, with a .45 pistol on his desk.
His first words:
"You won't get out of here alive if you don't tell me everything you know."
He tried to make me feel guilty by asking how I, a Communist Youth activist, who wasn't a lesbian, who had led an exemplary life, could get involved with such trash.
He questioned me about Retamar and Guillen, of the Writer's Union.
I realised why I'd been arrested, Though he never made any specific charges, he said I was in there because I associated with people who were "individualists",
"degenerates" who had no proletarian zeal, and were "antisocial".
I was really shocked.
This agent of repression scorned not only vaguely dissident young people like me, but also Cuban cultural bigwigs.
During my last questioning he tried to break me, since I was so naive, by saying,
"Shit, don't you realise what those men you frequent are?"
"Ever thought of what two men do together in bed?"
I hadn't, and told him so.
With his .45 in hand, he gave me a detailed description of just what two men can do in bed.
I was so embarrassed that I couldn't look at him.
I realised that Guanabacoa prison a hidden city located beneath Havana. A sewer of spies, agents and soldiers, an underworld of repression in Cuba.
I, who was pro-Revolution, had no idea of it.
We had been followed for months. There were huge files on us. People like Nicolas Guillen, who were above reproach, were viewed by the Ministry of the Interior as little better than criminals.
After two weeks, I was returned to my parents.
This is signed by Miguel Fernandez.
It says that as I was a minor
I could go home provided that my parents delivered me, the next day at 2 p.m. to a psychiatric hospital where I would remain the time necessary to eliminate the effects for which I'd been placed there.
I'd be in a mental ward. Incommunicado.
I couldn't tell my friends.
No-one in Havana knew what had happened to me.
Not even Nicolas Guillen could find out.
I disappeared.
And then I reappeared four months later.
In 20 years of Revolution there have been no disappearances.
People guilty of counter-revolutionary crimes were judged by the courts, after being tried.
True, there was a period when we had more than 15,000 counter-revolutionaries in our prisons.
I insist in description and defence of so many women were that jailed as "common criminals".
This large population of women in prison seems to be to be symbolic of the revolutionary process
This was a product of the Revolution.
I saw these common criminals beaten so savagely on their breasts, kicked, dragged.
Even if they did behave badly, this was inhuman treatment.
They were isolated in the last cell block, known as the punishment block, on concrete beds, with almost no light.
You'd see mulatto women, whose skin was quite dark.
They'd be confined to that block for 25, 30, 45 days, depending on the sentence that was given them by the wardens.
When they came out, their skin was white. They were so pale and skinny,
As if they'd been in a concentration camp.
That's what "New Dawn" was like.
At night you'd hear the wailing, the cursing, the despair.
In the end, we, the political prisoners, the few of us left there, were put in a small cell block only about 200 metres from the punishment block.
And in the still of the night, it was real torment to hear the women in there.
Tell me if that's any way to treat people.
They call it rehabilitation, That's what those women's prisons are supposed to be.
I could tell you hundreds of stories about things that happened in jail.
But even though I remember it all clearly, what saved me was that I felt no hatred.
I remember, but I don't hate.
Unquestionably, individuals have a lot of scope.
Under the conditions brought about by the Revolution all kinds of talents, characters, and personalities can thrive.
I assure you that socialism offers human beings
an incredible number of possibilities they didn't have under the previous regime.
You'd better go to sleep.
It is true, not much is known about it.
But what seems to me most significant isn't really what happens, but why it happens.
To be different, to be strange, to have "improper conduct",
isn't just forbidden, but totally repressed.
It can land you in jail.
It's part of the Cuban character, and has been for ages.
It's not unique to Castro. There are many Castros.
There must restrain the Castro that's in all of us.
It's an attitude we drag around with us.
We've dragged around a whole series of reflexes, of long-standing behaviour patterns.
and they condition us.
It's a vicious circle.
We're all trapped in paranoia, and we all feed that paranoia.
persecutors and persecuted alike, because at times the persecuted seem to be the persecutors.
Everyone suspects everyone else.
And this paranoia leads us to ...
Moscow on the Hudson
Excuse me, please, sir.
Does this bus go to the Lincoln Center?
-Lincoln Center?
-Yes.
You're on the wrong bus.
It's okay, don't worry.
All you have to do is go to 57th Street, change buses and get on the No. 30 bus.
Don't worry. I'll let you know when it's time.
Then you go and get a free transfer from the driver.
-Thank you.
-No problem.
It's tough getting around here at first.
I WANT TO GO TO ISRAEL
Toilet paper?
Shoes, I think.
They must be Czech or Polish for such a line.
I don't know.
Size?
Forty-five.
No forty-fives left.
Forty-four or forty-six will do.
We only have thirty-eights.
I'll take three pairs.
Only two to a customer.
Two thirty-eights, then.
If you want to go on the New York tour you'd better behave.
You are late. We're getting ready.
Don't you want to go to New York?
I couldn't help it.
Czech?
The queue was endless.
I wear a forty-two.
These are thirty-eight.
How much?
Forty roubles.
Forty?
I know you only paid twenty.
All right.
I give them to you as a gift.
Why forty, you only paid twenty?
Did you lick his ass good?
Was it tasty?
When you arrive in New York, you must understand that you are representatives of the nation of the revolution.
Many people will take perverse pleasure in tempting you with American decadence.
KGB pig!
They see you as targets for seduction.
Prostitutes will try to tempt you with their unhealthy immorality.
And stay away from places like the subway.
Times Square.
Greenwich Village.
Rockefeller Center.
I'm an artist, and an artist without freedom is a bird without wings.
Watch where you drive, artist.
I know the same nausea is grabbing at you.
I am content.
Bullshit!
You are a gear in a bad machine.
Don't you have a soul?
My soul is standing in line at the food store.
Gasoline!
Fill them up.
See how corrupt we are.
America is not corrupt?
France? My soul is dying.
My stomach is growling.
Let's practice our English.
Let us practice. You start.
Hello, mister.
-Hello, mister. May I buy lamb chop?
-Sure thing, mister.
-Do you read Ernest Hemingway?
-Every fucking day.
Kiss me, beautiful. Beautiful? Beautiful.
I love you.
Yes, my dear clown?
When we come to New York, I'm going to defect.
-Why do you do this to me?
-I had to tell you that.
You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities.
I want a Mercedes-Benz.
I want to piss in the wind.
I want to see Rio de Janeiro!
I want to see London! I want to see Paris!
Stop it.
Taxi, take me out of here!
I could be KGB.
Then my ass is already frozen.
Please.
Be careful, my friend.
I hate my life.
Tonight at 9:00, as usual?
Yes, see you.
Toilet paper?
Toilet paper or chickens, I'm not sure.
Toilet paper?
Top quality.
Thank you.
Leonid?
You're back.
How is your music?
I still play for tigers and bears.
And you? Are you teaching?
No. I have a newjob.
I pave streets.
I protested Afghanistan--
I know. I heard.
They said I was crazy, so they sent me to a mental hospital.
Were you crazy?
If I was really crazy, how would I know it?
We shall talk, Leonid.
Don't ever go crazy if you can help it.
You! Don't try to break in the line!
You found it!
Congratulations, Vladimir.
Why does everyone in this family make such a fuss over toilet paper?
Eating and going to the bathroom are the secrets of happiness.
I've made some borsch, Vladimir.
I can't.
I'm meeting Svetlana.
If you married her, you'd get an apartment of your own.
I'm not ready for another marriage.
I like Svetlana.
Is she the one with the big tits ?
You should have been a poet, Grandfather.
Oh, I almost forgot!
Pickled mushrooms.
It would make me happy to be a grandmother, Vladimir.
Look at those black people.
What a mess.
Beautiful people and great musicians.
Do you know Duke Ellington?
There's a great tune: Take the 'A' Train.
Now we'll be arrested for sure.
Before we marry, you should join the Party.
It would help us get a good apartment.
You know I'm not a joiner.
It's a bit humiliating, always borrowing Anatoly's place.
That's what friends are for.
Get away, you snoop.
I am going to report you to the police.
-May I kiss your lamb chops, beautiful? -Okay, mister.
I have something for you.
You certainly know how to get to a girl's heart.
It's for your soft, rosy bottom, not your heart.
Will you miss me in America?
Yes.
You know, I am jealous of you.
Why?
I wish I could see America.
Yes, I am lucky.
I'd like to see it with my own eyes the decadence the crime, the poverty....
The inflation.
You know what I would like from America?
Blue jeans, my darling. Jordache. Sergio Valente....
Too much vodka.
Hush, my Don Juan, hush.
There are whores in Gorky Park who have carved my name on trees.
Horseshit!
You smiling bastards.
Good morning, Grandfather.
Good morning, Vladimir.
Next they'll tell us the crops are good this year.
The agricultural news is excellent this morning.
Lies, tell us more lies.
You shouldn't talk that way, Father.
You have no respect for position.
Let them come and arrest me.
Let them take me away like Leonid, the neighbour's boy.
Leonid is stupid.
He sympathised with the Afghans.
Trotsky was right.
They have dumped shit on the revolution from head to toe.
You'll land us all in prison.
They're not looking for you.
You're not a dissident.
You're not Sakharov or Shcharansky.
Our leaders are only good for parades.
And they don't have any balls.
I've never seen the balls of our leaders.
Oh, you'll see them. In the next revolution.
They'll hang the balls of our leaders on the walls of a museum.
Good morning, Vladimir Ivanoff.
I have done nothing.
Perhaps.
Nicholai lvanoff is your grandfather?
Of course.
Your neighbours say he yells anti-Soviet slogans out of the window.
He's an old man.
Makes rude gestures at people doing their socialist duties.
He is a comedian.
He likes mischief.
Perhaps he is senile and should go to a mental hospital.
He is a war hero.
Please, I will talk to him.
It might be wiser for you not to use the apartment of your friend, Anatoly Cherkasov, for your sexual encounters.
I have done nothing wrong.
Good. It might go well for your grandfather if you kept your eyes on Cherkasov.
He is only a clown.
Yes, but perhaps he wants to clown his way out of the Soviet Union.
Goodbye, Vladimir Ivanoff.
Also, those fucking shoes are killing me.
Vladimir, one day I'll perform on Broadway. It will be a big sign:
"Anatoly Cherkasov and Barbara Streisand."
America is magnificent.
They say it is customary to take towels.
Look, a giant prophylactic.
It fits me.
Please speak English.
You promised. I must practice.
-Okay, mister. -Thank you very much.
This television is a piece of crap, just like in Russia.
My father will love this.
It must be smooth like velvet.
Stop thinking of your ass and think about your soul.
Don't play game with me, okay, pal?
Do you want to know why I am lucky to share room with you, polodurak?
Because they want me to spy on you.
I shit on them!
Maybe this decadence attempt to lure us.
Then they have succeeded.
-What a country.
-What a country.
I really do want to go to Leningrad.
Tell me, do you like Barbara Streisand?
Yeah, she's wonderful.
Waiter, I'll have a Black Russian.
-Is something the matter?
-No, I am happy here be.
-Your English is excellent.
-So is your.
Veronica Cohen. I teach Marxism at Columbia University.
Vladimir Ivanoff.
I am musician with circus.
Yes, I know.
You don't look like a Marxist.
I'm not.
I'm a humanist.
What does a Marxist look like?
Usually has beard, moustache.
-The women, too?
-In Russia, especially women.
Excuse me.
I am happy to talk to you, but I must now to make toilet.
What about your president?
He was an actor before, just like us.
What about credibility with him?
I know what I will do.
Tomorrow, during the opening parade, in my bicycle routine, I'll do it.
-I will defect.
-Good. They throw you right to bear.
Tomorrow is the day.
Think of your family.
Would you like to watch me take a piss, comrades?
Soon we'll be back in Moscow.
Ladies and gentlemen, good day.
I hope it ain't as bad as when we had them Chinese acrobats.
Them Italians came one time and stole half the store.
They weren't Italians, they were Romanians.
I thought they said they was from Rome.
See the game last night?
Yeah, Magic Johnson was the best guard I ever saw.
What a pair of hands.
Buon giorno, Lucia, darling. What a piece of lasagne.
You have only 30 minutes to shop in Bloomingdale's.
Then we go to the airport.
My God!
What decadence!
Excuse me.
You must be Russian.
Yes, I am with the circus.
We heard you guys were coming today.
Let me tell you something.
I wish for peace among all nations.
I am looking for blue jeans.
We had a nuclear freeze demonstration this year, and I marched.
"Make love, not war," we say.
Make love, for sure.
I look for blue jeans.
Blue jeans, right. Designer jeans?
Jordache, Calvin Klein?
You go straight back to menswear, like where that pole is.
I am Russian, not Pole.
Yeah, I know.
Well, anyway, you go straight, okay?
Then you take a left.
You can't miss the Denim Den.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
I hope you have a nice stay in New York.
I go back to Moscow today.
Well, goodbye.
I will do it here.
Everyone watches here.
I don't give a shit.
I swear, I'll do it.
Do it! Go. Do!
Leave me alone.
Go, do it.
Three items to a dressing room.
Gentlemen, please button your flies.
What are you doing? No women in the dressing room!
Women don't belong in the dressing room!
They don't stay in the dressing rooms!
They can't be here. What do you mean--
I don't understand.
You're in America, speak English.
Are you feeling well, Anatoly?
You are pale and sweating.
It's nothing.
Just a slight cold.
You know, different climate.
Soon you will be back in Moscow, where the air is always clear.
-I can't do it.
-Good.
I am a bird without wings.
I'm sorry, my friend.
What are you guys doing?
Only one customer to a cubicle.
This ain't Russia.
Excuse me, sir.
Fags everywhere.
-Your wife will love Forbidden Fruit. -Thank you.
Time to go.
Put Cherkasov and the others on the bus.
I would like to see some Forbidden Fruit.
Great.
All right, I'll see you tonight.
Talk to you later.
Fabulous choice, sir.
Are you all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I suddenly feel dizzy.
Let's get you some H2O.
-I got a dizzy Russian on my hands.
-Take him home for supper.
-Is there a large gay community in Russia?
-How would I know? I'm not Russian.
The men's room is downstairs, to the left of the escalator.
This ain't no health club.
-I defect. -Say what?
Don't be grabbing on the uniform.
I have to supply the threads myself.
I defected.
You're not gonna do that here.
I told you where the men's room was.
Maybe I better take him.
I am Russian.
-I defect.
-You're about ready to get maced.
Oh, my God! Don't you get it?
He's defecting!
Code 2. We got a defection going on. Style Boutique.
Officer 14 on the scene. Call the damn police!
You son of a bitch!
Please, help me.
-Are you the one defecting?
-Yes, I in danger, KGB.
I think it's safe.
I know the Russian is behind the counter.
Give him my card.
My name is Orlando Ramirez.
I'm a lawyer. I specialise in immigration.
You've got a lawyer.
Thank you.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Excuse me.
Get up.
Stay here.
Stay right here.
This is Officer 14.
The defector is between Estee Lauder and Pierre Cardin.
Officer, you must help me.
I want political asylum.
-I am a security officer, not a policeman.
-They will send me to a mental hospital.
-Who are these dudes?
-KGB. They will kill me.
-We are Soviet officials.
-Keep your hands off the man.
-Don't threaten me!
-I got Mace and handcuffs.
If that don't dissuade you, I got a 6-inch razor that will end this talk.
Stay put until the authorities get here.
Call the embassy!
I want to keep my comrade from making a big mistake.
I told you to back off!
You're in my jurisdiction which runs from Style Boutique to Personal Fragrances.
So keep your hands off the man!
-What's going on here, Mr. Simpson?
-I don't know.
-Don't blame me.
I was on the floor. -Who knows?
Some Russian is running around talking about defection.
We don't like that at Bloomingdale's, and it's up to you to keep order.
Everybody on the bus.
Everybody back on the bus.
In the name of the Soviet Union, I protest.
This Soviet citizen has been drugged.
-I am not drugged.
-He's being held against his will.
Nobody is smoking no shit around here.
I've had it with you guys today.
Back off!
I'm Kaity Tong at Bloomingdale's with a drama in American-Soviet relations.
Things are chaotic here, but this is what we know so far:
Apparently, a member of the Russian circus troupe, performing in New York has decided to defect in, of all places, Bloomie's.
Vladimir, I trusted you.
Now you do this to your family and to me.
You know what my life will be now?
Vladimir, have mercy.
You are a Russian.
Please, I will give you everything I own.
My sweet Volodnishka, please.
Your grandfather never.
I defect.
This is New York City. A man can do whatever he wants.
The FBI has just arrived on the scene. Gentlemen, a few questions.
How do you plan to handle this?
I'm Agent Ross with the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.
-Frank Williams, Justice.
-Mr. Ivanoff, let's talk.
-What exactly do you protest?
-You cannot permit him to defect.
It seems he's already defected.
Mr. Ivanoff, can you tell us why you're defecting?
-Freedom.
-Political freedom or artistic?
Freedom.
For now, consider yourself an applicant for political asylum in the U.S.
That's a matter for lmmigration.
-You can still come home.
-I defect.
Let us pass.
Excuse us.
This means Siberia, for sure.
Do you have any family or friends in the United States?
Sir, it's $147.50 for the robe and $30 for the windbreaker.
Bitch.
Do you know anyone here, sir?
Only you.
And this good black man and shopping girl.
-Where is he going to stay?
-He can stay with me if he wants.
I can stay your home?
I'm Security Officer Witherspoon.
I understand how the brother feels.
I'm a refugee myself, from Alabama.
-Hold it! -Wait a minute!
Tolya, I did it.
I'm free like a bird.
What are you saying?
I say goodbye to my saxophone.
Say what?
Mr. Ivanoff, did I hear you say goodbye to your saxophone?
He left his saxophone on the bus, I think.
Also, you waved goodbye to your friends.
You are very sad, obviously.
No, I am happy.
It is so nice to be here.
Yeah, he's going to stay here.
I think he knows you are a foreigner.
He's jiving on you.
You got to learn to look mean.
You understand what I'm saying?
Mean.
Is that your mean look?
Look crazy.
Like this.
Crazy.
Crazy motherfucker.
Many different people here, but not many white people.
This is what is known as a ghetto, with a capital "G."
I like it.
It is nice.
And the music, it's so free.
-Must be pretty bad in Russia.
-It's not human.
-But there are many beautiful people.
-Sounds like Alabama.
I read about slavery.
-With slavery, the work was steady.
-Sounds like Russia.
I make joke.
I feel to make joke in other language is good.
...a member of the Russian circus troupe, performing in New York, has decided to defect in, of all places, Bloomie's.
-Get in here. You're on TV.
-You look handsome.
You look good, Vladimir.
Now you go running out the store.
We can see it again on the 1 1 :00 news.
Mama, this is Vladimir.
This is my stepfather, Fletcher.
My bucket-head sister, Leanne.
My grandfather.
You have to watch out for his ass.
-I never met a Russian. They all white?
-You defected.
Yes.
You are kind to share your home with me.
Hope you didn't come for a job. I haven't had one for eight years.
Welcome to the U.S.A.
Honey, you don't look so well.
Let's sit him down. You look peaky.
You can just lay down right here.
Lionel, get his feet up, honey.
Lionel, man in store give me card.
"Orlando Ramirez." Sounds like a Cuban ambulance chaser to me.
Get his fucking feet off my couch.
Hush, Grandpa!
Good night, my American family.
I'm going to help you with everything. Everything. Always.
It is very important to know that you have a friend in Orlando Ramirez.
-Thank you. -You don't have to thank me.
You have to pay me.
That's the way capitalism works.
One hand helps the other.
I have $120 and one pair of blue jeans.
My fee for helping you with immigration matters is cut and dry.
-May I call you Vladimir? -Of course.
Orlando.
That is a musical name.
My father was called Orlando.
He rolled the finest cigars in Havana.
Orlando "el Rey," they called him.
Orlando "the King."
Then Castro came along and my father was on his ass.
Castro is a great man.
He's a bullshit artist who has been taken in by Russian bullshit artists.
I'm not political.
-We had to get our asses out of Cuba.
No.
We took a life raft to Miami Beach, Florida.
The only way to fly, let me tell you.
It was almost 20 years ago.
-I want to go shopping later.
-I want to get something for the kids.
-We don't have any kids.
Jack's kids.
He wants some scuba gear for the kids.
Some vacation.
They said this place was sunny. This isn't sun.
You get better sun on our roof.
We're not wasting $10 on that lotion.
There's the boy.
Ask him for a couple of rum and Cokes and beach towels.
Give me two Cuba Libres and a couple of beach towels.
Here, come on, make it snappy.
Talking to them is like talking to a wall.
Well, here I am.
It hasn't been easy, but you can do anything in this country.
Where are you going?
You passed Chambers Street twice already.
Sorry, sir.
I think Chambers Street here, but Chambers is over there.
Drive a cab in Korea if you don't know one street from the other.
Mr. Ivanoff, this is only stage one.
You will be interviewed again to determine your status.
Until then, you'll need a work permit.
Make sure the man understands all of this, Mr. R.
I understand.
When for next interview?
In one month, we'll give an advisory opinion if asylum should be granted.
Don't worry, you'll get it.
-In a year, you can petition for citizenship.
-I must wait for one year?
Do you know how many people want to get in this country?
Vietnamese, Korean, Salvadorians. Those Iranians, Mexicans, Bolivians, Greeks, Turks.
Have mercy. So many people.
I have mercy, but I can't carry the work home.
I'm like a TV set.
Turn me on at 8:00, turn me off at 4:00.
I have been waiting two hours.
Who is your boss?
His name is Ronald Reagan!
Now sit the fuck down, Mr. Baktar!
Mr. Baktar, your impatience is wearing me down.
I've been here two days waiting to see the lmmigration Office.
You guys going to dance?
No, I rest now.
He is good boy, Lionel.
So-so.
No, he's nice, but don't call him "boy."
Why not?
Black men don't like to be called "boy." They take it as an insult.
-That was a brave thing you did yesterday.
-Thank you.
For the first time, I act from here, not from here.
-You are a good girl?
-Yes, good girl. You're a good boy?
I would like to know you.
I'm ltalian.
From Italy. From the Abruzzi.
It's a little village called Casoli.
Everybody I meet is from somewhere else.
It's America.
-Would you like to dance?
-Okay.
Why you came America?
When my father died six years ago, he left us seven children.
We were so poor. There wasn't much opportunity for a girl.
Or for a boy, for that matter.
So, I guess I was the lucky one.
I have an Uncle Sal who lives here.
He has a funeral parlour.
-He sponsored me.
-You speak very well.
In a few months, I will become a citizen.
Then watch me take off.
Take off?
I mean, I want to work in media.
In TV. Television.
I love sportscasting.
Or newscasting.
Remember yesterday, this girl Kaity Tong?
At Bloomingdale's. You know, the girl?
I think she's great.
She's fantastic.
-I am be followed.
-Where?
That man.
That's the fbi.
They watch you for a few weeks, make sure you're not a spy.
Also to keep the KGB from kidnapping you, for your own protection.
Relax, amigo.
-Is that a new dance from Russia?
-Excuse me for my rudeness.
-Thank you for protection.
-That's what we're here for.
Have a good time.
All this week we've been working on the stomach. Here's part three.
Time to work on the stomach again.
We'll begin with abdominal warm-ups.
Remember how to do this one?
You inhale and keep it nice and firm.
First we do lower back-drops.
-Good morning, Vlad.
How you doing?
-Good. I feel fine.
I wish to be useful.
How may I help you?
You can do the shopping.
I have an appointment at the Human Resources Administration.
-The unemployment office.
-Lucia has something going for you.
She's got an ass on her.
I like, last night, musicians much.
Excellent saxophones.
You ever hear of the "Bird"?
-The great Charlie Parker?
-He was a wailing ass.
That boy could blow.
Excuse me, Grandpa, why you call Charlie Parker "boy"?
What should I call him? "Rhinoceros"?
-How's the coffee coming?
-We're out of coffee.
-We'd have coffee if you'd get off your butt.
-Don't talk to me like that.
-I'll work when I can find something.
-You could've delivered telephone books.
Bullshit! Deliver books!
I got a college education.
We know you got a college education.
You told us a million times!
You're just like your mother. Just like your mother.
Leave my mother out of this.
She's more of a man than you'll ever be.
I go shopping. I must to pay.
Please.
Coffee?
Aisle 2.
-Coffee line, please?
-Aisle 2.
No line, though.
"Taster's Choice...
"...decaffeinated...
"... Maxwell House, EI Pico...
"... Chock Full O'Nuts, espresso...
"...cappuccino, Cafe Francais...
"... Sanka, Folger's...
"... Cafe Caribe."
Coffee.
Coffee!
Coffee!
Mr. Ivanoff, don't worry.
You're merely suffering some hyperventilation.
Don't be alarmed.
You are among friends.
You should have seen yours truly when I first came from Bombay.
I was very nervous.
Look at these girls.
They know, too.
I am feeling better.
-You're something of a celebrity.
-I'm his lawyer, Orlando Ramirez.
Everybody was worried about you.
My wife thought you'd been kidnapped by the KGB.
I'm sorry.
I have wonderful news for you.
-I've made some calls to find you a job.
-I take it.
-Nothing fancy, my friend. -I take it.
When you speak English, does your mouth hurt?
My mouth is fine. My brain hurts.
When I speak English, my lips and tongue hurt.
-I wish they would stop playing this music.
-I wish only to play music.
-You'll get your chance.
-So will you.
Do you know how difficult it is to get a job in celestial mechanics and astrophysics?
Boy, you speak English well.
In a couple of minutes, we will take a break.
Maybe we pick up cheeseburger, side of fries, and Coca-Cola.
"Dearest parents, dear Sasha, and beloved Grandfather:
"I don't know if you'll ever receive this letter...
"...but I will write to you every week.
"I am sorry to cause you pain, but I acted out of real need.

What does he need that Madison Avenue preppy junk for?
-This will make your feet sing.
-They're very popular.
Madison Avenue is where the money is being made.
-People make judgment from the shoes.
-What do you know?
You're a foreigner.
While your ancestors were beating drums in Africa and chasing animals barefoot my people were giving the world Michelangelo.
-We invented style.
-You ever been to Little Italy?
All I see is plastic fruit and fat guys in tiny hats.

-Those?
Keep looking.
No, I take those.

"They were made in Italy. "

I thought we had a moment back there.
I hope it didn't upset you.
No. It's okay, mister.
Thank you.
Good luck.
"Dear Tolya:
I have a new saxophone...
"...but I still don't have work as a musician.
"I have many otherjobs, though. "
Two Big Macs, one Quarter Pounder with cheese six pieces Chicken McNuggets, two boxes Ronald McDonald cookies one order McFries, two chocolate milk shakes.
Is that to go?
No, I eat it here.
Come back Mc-soon.
"I am now driving a taxi part-time. "
Sunday I got a date with Lucia.
I knew it!
I knew there was something going on between you and her.
No, nothing going on.
I'm still virgin in New York City.
There ain't no crime in sex. You're too shy.
-She digs you, man.
I know she does.
-You think so?
You're probably the only man in New York without herpes.
"I have met some members of Russian community.
"Some of them are painters, sculptors, writers, photographers.
"They all have made adjustments to life in America.
"To tell you the truth, dear Tolya, they still despair, and so do I.
"And, dear friend, I wish you joy for all your days.
"Kiss the bears and the ponies.
"Perhaps, some day, I will see you again. Volya. "
I like it.
It's very nice.
Not much furniture.
You bought the blender we had on sale.
What do you make with it?
Nothing.
I don't blend anything.
You miss Russia, don't you?
Sure.
Sometime.
You want some vodka?
I'd love some.
You like music?
I love also music.
That's a nice tape deck.
I buy it from friend of Lionel's from back of truck.
A ghetto blaster.
It's a good thing you found Lionel in your life.
This tape I bring from Russia.
It is great Wild Bill Hawthorn, black saxophonist.
I tape from Radio Free Europe.
It's nice music.
Would you like to dance?
Why not?
You miss Italy?
No, I don't miss Italy at all.
I miss my family.
My brothers, my sisters.
When I make it big, I'll bring them all here.
They'll love it.
Now, my mother's a very nice lady but she's into that black dress for life, so she better stay there.
When I go back to Brooklyn and the Russian stores the smells remind me of home.
And I know I can't go back, but at least you can go back.
No, I don't want to go back.
I want to stay here.
I'm very good here.
You smell very good.
It's Charlie.
-No, it's not perfume. -Yes, it is.
It's you.
I really like you.
Likewise.
But I am....
-You have boyfriend?
-No.
I am a free woman.
I don't like to get involved.
Me, too.
What I mean is that if I stay here with you tonight I don't want you to think anything special about it.
To exaggerate what it is.
You understand?
Yes.
I assure you as former citizen of the Soviet Socialist Republic I make no moral thought about sex.
I respect your new life.
Thanks.
But I do desire you in a big way.
Likewise.
I take FDR Drive, sir, to beat the traffic.
Whatever you say.
This is my first trip to NYC.
You relax, sir.
There's Perrier in the side bar.
TV is working. I think General Hospital is on.
-What time is it, by the way?
-12:00 in five minutes.
I had my damn watch stolen out at the airport last night.
Really? That's a bitch.
Went into the washroom, took my Rollie off, set her on the basin stepped back to shake the dew off my lily turned around, and she was gone like that.
-I'd like you to check this out. -What's that?
It's a digital.
It's Japanese.
Touch gives you heartbeat and body temperature.
-What part of Texas are you from?
-The East Village, sir.
Seventh Street.
You sound further away than that.
I have a fountain pen with an alarm clock built in.
Check this out.
You've got your hand on the bucket and you're headed toward the well.
I also sell vitamins. Look at this.
"True Nature." It's a six-pack of health.
It's great for your sex life.
Gives you the dick of death.
I'd like to trade me some flat for some round. Pluck one of them long-stemmed American beauties. A little shaky pudding.
But get me to my hotel on time.
Just relax, sir.
I give you great limo.
-I liked E. T. better.
-I think it was decadent.
I think it was fun and sexy.
It was childish.
It had no point of view, no moral content.
On the Lucia Lombardo scale of one to ten, I give it a seven.
-You're reviewing film for the masses?
-No, but it's a fantasy.
You want fantasy, let's go to my place.
I can't.
I have to study.
I have a class tomorrow.
-All she does is go to classes.
-Don't get possessive, okay?
I think I'm going to go back in and see the movie.
I understand your liberation, but what will you do with these classes?
I can do anything.
This is America.
Let me know if you find something for me.
You make a mountain out of mothballs.
All I said was let's go.
-Yeah, because you want sex.
-Why not?
Sex is good for you.
I'll see you sex fiends later.
-See you. -'Bye.
No, just let go.
-God. -I'm sorry.
-You're not my boss.
-You're right.
-This can only work if we are equal.
-I agree.
If all Russians could eat Mu Shu Pork, they wouldn't be afraid of the Chinese.
Tell me, are all the Russians as funny as you?
You have beautiful lamb chops. Did anyone ever tell you that?
Yes.
You're happy all the time?
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I sit up and wonder where I am.
In Russia, you do that all day long.
You want to help me study?

All rise for the Honourable Judge Louise R. Reynolds.
You may sit.
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
Today you will become citizens of the United States of America.
No longer are you an Englishman, Italian, or Pole, or whatever.
Neither will you be a hyphenated American.
From this day, you are no longer a subject of a government but an integral part of the government.
May you find in this nation the fulfilment of your dreams of peace and security and may America, in turn, never find you wanting in your new proud role of citizen of the United States.
Will the petitioners please rise?
Now, let us take the oath of allegiance.
"I hereby declare, on oath...
"...that I absolutely and entirely renounce...
"...all allegiance and fidelity...
"...to any foreign prince or potentate...
"...that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws...
"...of the United States of America...
"...against all enemies.
"I take this obligation freely...
"...without any mental reservation...
"...or purpose of evasion...
"...so help me God."
Congratulations, citizens.
A wonderful day, I think.
-You have period today?
-No, why?
-You're so serious.
-It was an emotional day.
I'm just tired.
Goddamn it!
What?
I'm sorry. I can't help myself.
-Nightcap? -No.
What's the matter?
You don't like a man being crazy for your sweet zhopka?
-Not with my Uncle Sal around.
-Uncle Sal is sleeping.
Why doesn't he like Russians?
He thinks you're a Communist.
You know what I think?
I think we should move in together.
I think you should live with me.
That way we save on rent, utilities.
You don't have to take the "A" train to make love with me.
-What do you think?
-I don't feel like talking now.
You don't have to talk.
Just tell me what you think.
Haven't you ever felt like not talking about something?
In Russia that's permanent way of life.
Just give me some vodka.
You don't care for me?
-That's the problem.
-Problem, why?
I think I care too much.
Come here.
You know how much I love you?
Don't!
It makes it worse.
I have worked, okay?
I have worked and struggled to make myself an American.
An American!
I want to be in love with someone who fits with my....
Okay.
Now I understand.
I'm not Robert Redford. Okay.
-I didn't mean it that way.
-What the hell do you mean?
Don't you understand?
It's too fast.
I'm not ready for this.
I don't want this.
I'm not ready for full-time love yet.
That's fine.
I don't love you.
What do you mean, you don't love me? Yes, you do love me!
You are big American.
Okay, congratulations, citizen!
Communist Pope killer!
There goes the neighbourhood.
Let me tell you, she's not the only piece of pasta on the menu so you have to make a move for something else.
Hello, sweet thing.
Don't turn up your nose, honey, it blocks the light.
Come on, Vlad, we're already here.
Let's go.
It's time to make a move.
Hello, sweet thing.
Don't turn up your light to me, it blocks the nose.
Vodka?
Double.
I can't do this. That's Wild Bill Hawthorn.
I got a surprise for you tonight.
I found out from a friend of mine that we have a musician, a Russian.
His name is Vladimir Ivanoff.
A nice round for lvanoff.
-Welcome aboard. -Thank you, sir.
I played over in the Soviet Union in 1964.
Yeah, I know.
Do you know the song or blues to Yolanda?
Why don't you sit in with us on it?
I got smoked, man.
You didn't get smoked.
What did you expect from the man?
What are you doing?
Better to know who you are.
That way you know your limits.
You know who the hell you are.
All he said was practice and work on it.
-No, man, I am shit.
-You're full of shit.
-By the way, you are white. -Thank you.
You just don't pick up soul in two or three months even if you are Russian.
And I'll tell you something else, that self-pity won't get you nowhere.
The saddest thing in the world is life.
You telling me?
It gets so bad, sometimes I don't think I'll make it.
Did I ever tell you I had a kid?
I met this girl, she got pregnant and went back home to Alabama.
Thomas Alva Witherspoon, 5 years old.
-That's wonderful.
-When I think of that kid, I want to cry.
Why don't you cry?
-It's good for you.
-I don't have to cry.
When I was in Russia, I did not love my life but I loved my misery.
You know why?
Because it was my misery.
I could hold it.
I could caress it.
I loved my misery.
You know, I have a whole family I will never ever see again.
You see? Now you see.
You know it.
There it is.
Now you know that the saddest thing in the world is life.
Yeah, man. Now you see.
Thank you. Thank you for a wonderful night.
Boy, I feel great.
Take care. I love you.
If that was wonderful, what happens when he hits deep depression?
Do you want to smell?
You like it?
If she doesn't like it, you can bring it back.
But don't lose the sales slip.
-Okay, thank you very much.
-You're welcome. Have a nice day.
What are you doing here?
-You must to help me.
-What do you want?
I'm looking for blue jeans.
I love you.
I don't want to argue with you, Vladimir.
I know you love me, too.
Defections are in the blue jeans department, fellow.
How are you?
I got some news.
-I'm turning in my badge.
-Why?
-I was due a raise and it didn't come.
-What are you going to do now?
I'm going to Alabama to see the kid.
That's good for you, but sad for us.
-I'll miss you.
-Why don't you two come see me?
We give you a call.
I want toilet water.
Tonight, we go and make party.
-No, I don't want to go with you. -For Lionel.
Why don't you want to go?
I don't want to argue.
I want toilet water.
If I go now, I don't ever come back, okay?
You hear me now?
I hear you now.
Goodbye.
-I want toilet water.
-For you.
Thank you, Lionel.
Thank you for everything.
You've been greatest friend to me.
I'm just a citizen.
You keep your pecker in your pocket.
Glad you came up here, Vladimir.
Just wanted to check in.
How you feeling?
Good and bad.
The feet have been swelling up, so I got to keep them up.
-Or so they say.
-You look good.
Shit, don't get old if you can help it.
In Russia, we honour the old people.
We take care of them.
I think I move out there.
Hello, sweet thing.
Don't turn up your nose, it blocks the light.
You hear from Lionel?
The boy sent a card.
Says he's okay.
Did he find work?
I don't know, but man do need to work to feel good.
Next week, we get tickets, we go to the ballgame.
-I'd love to if my feet are better.
-They'll be better.
-Take care, Pops. -So long, Vladimir.
Who is it?
Who are you?
Who the hell are you, KGB?
I have a letter for you.
From your family.
A letter?
Give it to me.
Come in.
Where did you get this?
I knew your sister, Sasha, at school.
How did you get it here? To America?
We were permitted to leave after only three years.
We are Jewish.
You have a beautiful home.
Bad news?
My grandfather died.
He was a comedian.
I will leave you, Vladimir Ivanoff.
Thank you.
Please call me when you get settled.
It's New York.
Goodbye.
Shut up down there!
It's not a nightclub, asshole!
If you're looking for trouble, you'll get it!
You don't like jazz, pal?
He was comedian.
He don't care about nobody.
Hey, you fuck yourself!
Okay, pal?
Okay, mister!
-Who are you?
-Where's the money?
-Why you do this?
-Just shut the fuck up!
-I am Russian.
-You're no fucking Russian!
I am Russian!
I am Russian!
What was in the wallet besides money?
Some ID, driver's licence, Social Security.
Easily replaceable, my friend.
You want to go to a doctor?
No.
This is a goddamn insane country.
They were so young, and their eyes were cold like animals.
In Russia, I knew who the enemy was.
Here, it's too confusing.
You're overreacting.
I always heard that Russians overdid things.
Is this liberty?
If it is, it's false liberty.
Where are the poets?
What do you want, a perfect place to live?
There's no such thing.
Police said, even if they catch them, they go free.
They're juveniles.
They get away with a lot of crap.
-Can I help you, gentlemen?
-Two coffees, please.
-An apple turnover. -Make it two.
When you can't walk down the street, is that freedom?
Do you really think you were better off before in Russia?
It's freedom for a woman to spread her legs like that on a magazine?
Hey, pal, you free?
Excuse us.
There's no freedom here.
If there is, she's an orphan.
To tell you the truth, New York frightens me.
It's brutal.
It's crazy.
What are you staring at?
Take it easy--
Don't tell me to take it easy!
No one tells me take it easy anymore.
What are you staring at?
What did he say?
He says that he's looking at a giant asshole from Moscow.
What's he saying now?
He said he's from Leningrad, giant asshole.
He's been here seven years and he loves it.
He's telling me to go back to Moscow, turd.
In Moscow, we have to fight for a crumb of freedom.
Here, you shit on it!
He says that if I want law and order I should go back and stand in line for bread.
Stale bread.
What the hell is that?
Firecrackers. Independence Day.
I'm sorry.
Independence Day.
You know, it's, "When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary...."
What is it? I forgot the rest.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident...
"...that all men are created equal...
"...that they are endowed by their Creator...
"...with certain unalienable rights. These are:
"Life.
"Liberty.
"Happiness."
Happiness.
Happiness.
What happened?
I got mugged.
What are you doing here?
You want me to go?
No. It's a nice surprise.
I came over because I was going to leave the key here. Waiting for you, I fell asleep.
You don't look very nice.
Are you sure you're fine?
I'm strong like Russian bear.
-How you been?
-I've been okay.
I've missed you very much.
Me, too.
I'm not ready for marriage yet but I would love to live with an immigrant.
"Beloved family: I received the news of Grandfather's death.
"Of course, I'm very sad...
"...but he lived on his own terms, even to the end.
"I'm playing my dear saxophone again.
"Yes, I've finally gotten work as a musician.
"My friend, Lionel, returned from Alabama and he now has my old job.
"In the day, I'm free to do what I please as long as it is legal. "
A hot dog, please.
Don't worry, my friend.
I'm retired.
Yeah?
What are you doing here?
Did you think I could go back to Moscow after what happened?
-Have you been well? -Yeah.
-It's a strange country? -Yes.
Strange and wonderful.
-Can I say thank you?
-Sure.
Put your money away.
It's a good hot dog.
The best in New York.
See you.
Okay, mister.
"This is a free country, welcome to almost anyone.
"And I hope that someday you will join me here.
"Of course, I will continue to write to you every week.
"Yes, in America anything is possible.
"Goodbye for now, beloved family. Volya. "

Together again
Thank you, thank you!
- They like it.
- They love it!
They're still applauding!
Kermie, you have to go out and take a bow!
Kermit!
Kermit!
Kermit!
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
I really don't know what to say, except we're really glad you liked Manhattan Melodies.
We all worked hard to make it the best Senior Variety Show ever.
Hey, Kermit!
Next time we'll see you on Broadway!
Yeah, sure.
That's a great idea!
Let's take Manhattan Melodies to New York!
Broadway is dying to get a great musical like this.
Broadway?
Thanks, everybody, for having so much faith in us.
It's not often that a frog and a bear and a pig and a chicken and a whatever even get accepted into college.
We're all so proud to be graduating now.
Some with honours...
Woman!
Woman!
Woman!
Woman!
And some with the help of daily psychological counselling.
Anyway, thank you again.
Thank you for everything, guys.
Broadway?
But this show's not good enough for Broadway.
And the script needs a lot of work.
I still think something's missing.
Remember you said we could not get married until we had enough money?
Well, we'd have enough if we had a hit on Broadway!
- Broadway of what city? - Gonzo!
What did I say?
Even if the show was good enough, we're all just graduating.
What about our future plans?
Well, this could be our future!
- That's right!
- And if we don't do it we just say goodbye to each other.
Broadway!
Broadway!
Broadway!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go to Broadway!
New York!
Look at everything!
Well, we made it, guys. We're really here!
What a great-looking place!
And it's filled with New Yorkers. Look at them.
Wowee!
Isn't this great?
Well, we better dump our stuff and find a place to stay.
- Scooter, break out the quarters.
- Yes, sir.
What do you think, guys?
How do you like it?
Much better than that cement mixer I lived in.
I'll trade with anyone that has a Jacuzzi.
Come on, it's just for one day.
We'll all be on Broadway tomorrow.
- We'd like to see Mr. Price.
- Do you have an appointment?
No.
But we've got this great show called Manhattan Melodies that he'll wanna produce on Broadway.
It's about kids that come to New York to marry and has a wonderful opening number that goes like this...
Hold it.
Hold it.
What's going on out there?
Just a frog with a musical, Mr. Price.
A musical?
Send him in.
Net, I'm talking net.
You gotta be kidding with gross.
Nice upholstery.
Hold it a minute.
I'll get back to you.
Mr. Price, I'm Kermit, and these are my friends.
We've got a show that you'll wanna produce on Broadway.
It's about kids that come to New York to marry and it opens with a number that goes like this...
Look at me, here I am
Frog, frog! No singing, okay?
Just give me the general idea.
- It's all about life in the big city. - In the big city?
With cops, shootings, car chases?
Well, no.
No shooting stuff.
It's more like songs and dances.
Songs and dances?
That might be interesting.
Nobody cares about shootings anyway.
Are you thinking big-name stars?
Actually, we're gonna be the stars.
That's exactly what I was about to say.
Unknowns.
Songs, dances, shootings.
No shootings.
You know what?
I smell something.
Why does everyone always blame dogs?
No, no.
What I smell is a hit. A hit!
You mean?
Absolutely.
I'd be proud to produce your show. You're gonna be on Broadway!
Hey, Kermit, we did it!
Thanks, Mr. Price.
But I'd like you to read the script.
There's still something missing...
Don't worry.
We fix those things in the previews.
I've gotta call the papers, rent a theatre and I need $300 from you.
$300?
Yeah.
Apiece.
Apiece?
Today.
Yeah.
What?
Fellas, that's standard Broadway procedure.
You give me money, we start rehearsals tomorrow.
- But we don't have...
- Kermie, I don't think that's right.
Now I smell something!
There are two police officers outside.
They'd like to speak to you.
That's him.
That's Murray Plotsky.
I gave him my life savings.
Murray?
I thought his name was Martin.
Let's go, Murray.
You've pulled your last con job.
I don't want any trouble.
Get back!
Get back, or the chicken gets it!
That's a threat?
- Don't hurt her.
Take me!
- Whatever you say!
Get away from that door.
Move!
Let go of my nose!
Watch it!
You too!
Easy!
Get that chicken off my ear!
Get him off my ear!
Bad man!
Bad man!
Way to go!
Where were you when I needed you?
Animals! You're crazy, all of you!
And I want my money back!
Gonzo, are you okay?
I just saw my whole life flash before my nose.
Camilla!
She's hyperventilating!
She needs mouth-to-beak resuscitation!
Kermit, he never wanted our show.
He just wanted our money.
Gonzo, is Camilla all right?
Yeah, but I think we're engaged.
Come on, we're gonna get this show on Broadway!
Come on, yeah!
Let's go, guys!
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
No, no, no
Whenever there's a dream Worth a-dreamin'
And you wanna see That dream come true
There'll be plenty people talkin' Say forget all about it
Say it isn't worth the trouble
All the trouble That you're goin' through
Well, what can you do?
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
No, no, no
What you gonna do When the times get tough
And the world's treating you unkind?
You've gotta hang onto Your optimistic outlook
And keep possession Of your positive state of mind
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
No, no, no
No, no, no
This is turning out to be a little tougher than I thought.
Kermit, I'm not good at this.
I don't take rejection well.
Maybe we'd sell the show with more special effects, like exploding socks.
- Oh, Gonzo. Like, that's a lame idea.
- Oh, yeah?
- Stop yelling at her.
- He wasn't yelling.
- Yes, I was.
- Gonzo, don't make trouble.
Fight! Fight!
Fight!
- Kermit, should we change the script?
- Yeah, what should we do?
I don't know!
How should I know?
Why are you always asking me? Can't you take care of yourselves?
I don't know what to do next.
We failed, okay?
We tried and we failed.
Scooter, how much money do we have left?
Enough for two nights, unless we find cheaper lockers.
Well, we have to eat.
Why start now?
Gangway!
Coming through!
Hey, watch it, will you?
Hey, that waiter's a rat.
I'm glad we got no money. Now I ain't got no appetite.
One cheeseburger platter.
What do you want to drink?
A glass of milk.
I would like some meat in here.
Picky, picky! Hey, Pete!
Where's the beef?
It's coming!
Got two hands only!
What'll you have?
The number for the Board of Health.
That does it!
Another rat crack, right?
Well, I got feelings too!
Do you think I'm doing this as a hobby?
You wanna know what I make around here?
Nothing!
Nothing!
I live on tips!
I work hard!
I try to get tips to feed my family and my mother.
It just isn't fair.
We understand.
We don't have any money either.
Sorry.
Not my table.
What a rat!
I'll get us something to eat.
Is patty coming! Is cow juice coming!
Rizzo, where's Jenny?
May I see a menu, please?
Yankee bean soup with spoon.
Sorry I'm late, Pop.
Hi, Fran. How are you?
It went longer than I thought.
But you will be so proud of me.
I did great!
And it was all essay questions.
No sweat. I know I passed.
Oh, Jenny, that's very good.
Is cow juice and patty for lady.
Rizzo, I'm back.
It's about time.
I can't handle everybody!
You can take the weirdos at table four.
Which one do you think is table four?
I wonder if Kermie really meant it. I mean, about failing.
Those producers looked at us like we were from outer space.
What?
No, man, go back to sleep.
Nobody's landed.
- We'll take 11 bowls, please.
- Okey-dokey.
But there's just one thing.
We've got this great show that's gonna be a big hit on Broadway.
But right now, we're all broke.
You mean, you don't have any money at all?
Well, not really.
No.
But we'd work it off.
We promise.
- Waitress!
- Coming!
I tell you what is.
Big city.
Live, work, huh?
But, not city open.
Only peoples.
Peoples is peoples.
No is buildings.
Is tomatoes, huh?
Is peoples is dancing, is music, is potatoes!
So peoples is peoples, okay?
Thanks.
That helped a lot.
Where you going?
Won't you wait for your soup?
- But I told you, we don't have...
- Yeah, I know, but I know my pop. When he started out in this city, he didn't have anything either.
I bet he's back there getting soup bowls for everybody.
Really? With soup in them?
I gotta get back to work.
I had a test today, so I came in late.
Yeah, I heard you passed the test.
I hope I passed.
It's for acceptance into a fashion-design college.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know, we just graduated from college.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My name's Jenny.
Hi, I'm Kermit.
Hi, Kermit. Nice to meet you.
I'm a frog.
Listen, all I'm saying is maybe it's time we went out on our own.
You mean, out on our own alone?
Without even each other even?
The frog's right.
We do depend on him too much.
He feels too responsible for us.
Man, he'd be better off if we left town.
I can't leave Kermit.
We're still pinned.
I'm sorry I blew up outside.
But guess what?
Pete's cooking up some soup for us.
Well, what's wrong?
It's just...
We've had some job offers. Right?
Well, that's great.
Well, these job offers are they're kind of out-of-town. Right?
What job did I get?
Piggy, are you going too?
Well, Kermie, I...
We go bye-bye?
We'll all write to you and let you know where we are.
Yeah, and Kermit, we still believe in the show.
Aboard!
Saying goodbye Going away
Seems like goodbye's Such a hard thing to say
Touching a hand Wondering why
It's time for saying goodbye
Goodbye, Kermie!
Piggy!
Bye!
Goodbye!
Saying goodbye Why is it sad?
Makes us remember The good times we've had
Much more to say Foolish to try
It's time for saying goodbye
Don't want to leave But we both know
Sometimes it's better to go
Somehow I know We'll meet again
Not sure quite where And I don't know just when
You're in my heart So until then
It's time for saying goodbye
Somehow I know We'll meet again
Not sure quite where And I don't know just when
You're in my heart So until then
Wanna smile
Wanna cry
Saying goodbye
It's time for saying goodbye
Look at all those people out there.
Lots of people.
But my friends my friends are all gone.
Well, I'm gonna get them back.
I'm gonna get them back.
Because the show's not dead as long as I believe in it.
And I'm gonna sell that show.
And we're all gonna be on Broadway.
You hear me, New York?
We're gonna be on Broadway!
Because I'm not giving up!
I'm still here and I'm staying!
You hear that, New York?
I'm staying here!
The frog is staying!
- Hi, Jenny.
- Kermit!
Hi!
Rizzo, is bagel with schmeer and hominy grit ready.
Excuse me?
Do you have some work I could help you out with?
- Rizzo, is ready.
- Part-time, so I can work on my show.
What is that stuff supposed to be?
Is grits. Grits.
Hominy grits!
How should I know how many?
Count them yourself!
What?
- Listen, Pete.
- Wait, wait. Hey!
What is?
This whole morning like this.
You complain.
You slow. You no take orders.
You lazy rat, you!
Lazy rat?
Okay, have it your way.
See if I care.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I quit!
Quit? You no can quit!
Is breakfast crowd!
All right, don't beg.
I'll stay. But I need some help.
Okay, this is it.
Don't blow it!
Pete, meet your new employees.
Say hello to Tatooey.
- Masterson.
- Hello.
- Chester.
- Oh, I feel terrible.
And Yolanda.
What a crazy body!
Pete, about that job.
See, I was wondering...
Wait, wait, wait!
Is no good!
Rats want job.
Frog want job.
What next?
Penguins?
You have any jobs available?
Well, excuse us for living!
Everybody's waiting for food.
Listen, I can work nights.
Come on, Pete, give these guys a break, all right?
For gosh sake, I go crazy!
Okay, okay, rats, you go to work.
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen.
I tell you what is.
Is no work, is dancing is cheese, is big shoes.
All right, rats, you go to work.
So, like, you got a boyfriend, or what?
There's nothing else?
I'll do anything.
I'll sweep...
We could always use help in the kitchen.
These dishes need washing.
Oh, thanks, Pete!
That's terrific.
Oh, boy!
- Thanks a lot, Jenny.
- Hey, no sweat!
So where are all your friends?
They had to leave.
Even your pig friend?
Yes, but I'm bringing her back.
I wrote the show, so when I sell it, I can bring them back.
I'm staying, and I'm getting our show on Broadway.
I really admire that.
I'm gonna do something special too, you know.
I mean, in fashion.
You know, maybe your fashion designing can help me now.
What do you mean?
I did some reading about Broadway producers and investors and agents and I know what I have to do to sell our show.
I can use your help, because I have a three-part plan.
And the first part is if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Hey, sweetheart!
I just flew in from the Coast.
I love your hair!
I got an appointment with, what's his name, your top theatre agent.
- Leonard Winesop?
- Yeah, Lennie, right.
What office is he in again?
He's in suite 1024, but I'll call and see...
No, that's okay, sweetheart.
No need for that because Lennie and I go way back.
I'm talking way back.
You're too much.
Far out!
Right on!
Mr. Winesop?
A frog?
With an Afro?
Hi, Lennie!
I just flew in from the Coast.
I love your office!
Don't change a thing.
My private plane's double-parked, so I gotta run.
I got this boffo, socko script for Broadway called Manhattan Melodies.
It's totally today, yet tremendously timeless.
You get first look-see.
Have I ever lied to you?
I hear my beeper.
I gotta split.
Have your people call my people.
We'll take a meeting, all right?
And remember, boffo, Lennie. Socko, Lennie.
Okay?
We'll have lunch.
Ciao!
Hi, Jenny!
Come here.
Have a seat.
Were you a hit? They loved it.
How'd the costume work?
The costume was great, but it's hard to tell how it went.
They're probably reading the script right now.
Hey, baby.
Baby!
Where you going, sweetheart?
Hello?
I said, hello?
For the next part of my plan, I have to look older.
I'll grow a mustache.
You'd look cute with a mustache.
You think so?
Piggy said that to me once too.
She's hot. Hot mama!
Hot stuff!
Looking good. Purple and pretty.
Pretty and purple.
Sweet thing!
Sweet thing!
She must be really talented.
Oh, I think you're talented too.
You mean it?
Of course.
I know you're gonna be a famous designer someday.
Oh, Kermit, thank you for saying that.
Come on, baby, don't be rude.
Look here, now. Look here.
What was that?
It's just New York.
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Wrightson.
I would suggest that it is neither prudent nor wise to be a half-hour late from lunch, especially on your first day.
Yes, sir.
Eileen, sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Everything's been going wrong lately.
Get your new French perfume here. Quelle Diff√©rence!
Is something wrong?
Can we talk?
- I'll be fine.
I'll be just bien!
- Sorry.
Get your Quelle Diff√©rence!
It's French! It's feminine!
It'll help you grab one of those rotten, stinking men!
- Quelle Diff√©rence...
- Piggy, please!
You were fine this morning.
Did something happen at lunch?
My frog turned on me.
Yeah, I had some bad tuna myself.
I'm gonna fight for him though.
Eileen, do you think I'm pretty?
Of course you are.
You're more than pretty.
Gorgeous?
Don't push it, Pig.
You're more than gorgeous, Piggy.
You're unique.
But you know, you could use a little rouge.
Have a seat.
- What are you doing?
- We'll fix you up.
We'll make you look like a movie star.
You need cheekbones.
Your face is round, no offense.
I'll give you a complete makeup job.
When you walked in, I said, "She needs rouge."
Turn your face.
Did you ever wear rouge?
- Now you're gonna really wear rouge.
- Kermit won't care.
Kermit, schmermit.
Look. You look great!
It brings out your eyes.
Know what you need?
- Eyebrows.
- Pigs don't have eyebrows.
This pig is going to.
And so is this.
I'm giving you big eye...
I think I overdid it.
Take a look.
- You have it too.
- I have them too!
- Do some more.
- I'll give you doe eyes.
- What are doe eyes?
- Bambi eyes.
- Let me see.
- Doe eyes!
- Do some more.
- You need freckles for cutesy.
- Freckles.
- Cutesy, cutesy, cutesy.
And I'll be cutesy with you.
You got it too.
You know what? Why don't you wear lipstick?
Pucker.
Pucker.
This is just...
You look fabulous!
Look at you.
A little more on the cheeks. And a little more on my cheeks!
Powder puff for you!
And a powder puff for me!
Quelle Diff√©rence!
The newest perfume...
You are fired!
What happened to the rats you had here?
A customer complained.
They no like rats for waiters.
But is okay. I make them cook.
Hey, Pete.
Here you go.
Two zeros on a trampoline with a side of Joan of Arcs!
Hey, how's the coffee?
The coffee's fine.
Come on in!
I said...
Kermit, when are you gonna start growing your mustache?
I stopped shaving three days ago.
Didn't you notice?
Well...
Well, it's subtle.
I bet we could help it along with a little makeup.
Good, because I'm ready for the second part of my plan.
Got mail for you.
Must be from the gang.
Now, Yolanda, chopping is an art.
You gotta be smooth.
Oh, hey, it's from Scooter!
"Dear Kermit:
How are you?"
Have you sold the show yet?
Have you heard from the gang?
I'm in Cleveland, and I have a terrific job.
I'm managing a huge movie house here.
Well, maybe not managing, but I do have a lot of responsibilities.
- Here are your glasses.
To the left. - Hurry up, Mom.
Thank you.
And I'm meeting some interesting people.
The popping corn is 3 - D!
The corn is popping in your face, and it's 3-D!
But, Chef, that's not how 3-D works.
Oh, never mind.
Here's your ticket.
Thanks.
But, sir, your 3-D glasses!
Sir, your glasses!
Sir, don't you want your 3-D glasses?
Oh, I don't need them. I've seen this movie 97 times.
My name is Lew Zealand. I'm a boomerang fish-thrower.
I throw the fish away, and they come back to me.
Oh, here's my favourite part.
The fish are coming from the game room!
Oh, no! The killer fish are attacking!
Go get them, guys!
So life is great here in Ohio.
Love, Scooter.
Here's one from Fozzie.
"Dear Kermit:
Wocka, wocka, wocka!"
But seriously, I'm in Maine.
My job didn't turn out too terrific so I decided to hibernate.
Ah, back to nature.
I love it out here in the woods.
It's where a bear should be.
How do they do it?
I've been trying to sleep for days.
Anybody got some warm milk?
Oh, brother.
Hello.
I didn't know this cave was coed.
My name's Beth.
Hi, I'm Fozzie.
I can't sleep either.
Maybe if we snuggle...
Kermit!
Here's one more from Dr. Teeth.
Dear Kermit:
How's the man?
We got this great gig here outside of Pittsburgh.
I tell you, frog the band's wailing the music's cooking.
The crowd here is also wailing and cooking.
Yeah, we're in hip city here.
They're all doing pretty well.
Yeah, they are.
But, you know, there are no letters from Gonzo or Rowlf or Piggy.
Oh, I'm sure they've written.
Sometimes it just takes awhile.
Yeah, sure. Piggy's probably busy with some kind of terrific job.
I guess they're all out there doing terrific.
If I could sell the show, everyone could come back and we could do it together, like in the old days.
You'll do it, Kermit.
Well, thanks, Jenny.
That's been happening a lot lately.
I know.
It's New York.
I'm ready for the second part of my plan.
I'm gonna need your help, and the other rats too.
I think we could be making some overtime.
- I need you to draw a picture of me.
- Sure!
Okay, what's the scoop?
Have you ever heard of a whispering campaign?
- Good afternoon.
- Kermit the Frog.
My reservation secretary made a reservation for me.
Gesundheit.
This way, please.
Afternoon, all.
Don't get up.
Keep eating.
May I take your coat?
No! That is no, thank you very much, indeed.
That's the closest I wanna be to a frog.
- Okay, guys, do your stuff.
- Right!
Okay, you start.
Say, isn't that that rich producer over there?
The one who's investing in Manhattan Melodies?
Yes!
He's investing millions of dollars in Manhattan Melodies!
What's that all about? Manhattan Melodies, what's that?
Isn't that Kermit the Frog, the bigtime producer?
A producer's here?
A big producer, dear.
There's a big producer over there.
It's the hottest thing coming to Broadway!
It's the best Broadway show of the year.
Vincent?
Vincent?
Did I do something wrong?
Vincent a frog?
- Gee, that food smells good up there.
- Yeah, I'm starving.
But this is all a misunderstanding!
Well, thanks a lot, you guys.
So what's the third part of your plan?
I don't think there's gonna be one.
I feel like I'm being a phony, and I can't take it anymore.
I don't know what to do next.
All right!
Moping time's over.
How about a little exercise?
I knew you wanted to.
Oh, dear Lord, not jogging.
Wow, it's such a beautiful day!
Give me a break!
Come on, let's go this way.
- Feel better?
- Yeah.
Good. Exercise does the trick.
Yeah, stretch the old frog legs.
My purse!
That does it!
Excuse me.
May I borrow those a moment?
Piggy?
You creep!
Get off!
I don't even know how to skate! You know that?
- What's going on?
- She stole my purse!
- What?
! - Good try, fella.
Come on!
That'll teach you to mess with a lady!
Understand? !
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you!
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
Sightseeing.
But you're supposed to be out of town.
I do not wish to discuss it in present company.
That's okay, Kermit.
I'll see you back at Pete's.
I'm glad you're not hurt, Miss Piggy.
Listen, what's going on?
Well, you're certainly looking different now.
No gold chains, no shirt cut to the navel, no toupee!
Quelle diff√©rence!
What's with all this French stuff?
By sheer chance, I happened to learn French and get a job interpreting at the UN.
Can I get my skates back, please?
Just a second.
How did you know about that toupee?
- None of your beeswax!
- Have you been spying on me?
I'll unlace them while you fight.
It's no trouble.
Have you been spying on me?
Maybe spying on vous and that certain young girl of the opposite gender.
You two-timing her?
No, it's just Jenny, a friend.
She's trying to help me sell the show!
He's gotta sell the show.
What show?
Well, if she is just a friend, then what about the huggies?
You gave Jenny the huggies?
You know, maybe, Kermit maybe it would've been better if we had never have met.
Then you and Jenny would not be tormented by my presence.
See what the huggies get you?
Jenny and I hugged because we're friends. That's what friends do.
Friends do not spy!
I forgot about that.
- I spied because I care!
- Well, I care too!
- Why don't you say so?
- I just did!
All right!
Keep the skates.
Keep the skates.
I never use them anyway.
I just like to run around in shorts.
Wait a minute!
Come on, Piggy.
Look, Waldorf.
It's the frog and the pig.
Yeah, it looks like they're in love.
Kind of makes you sick, doesn't it?
Hey, lovey-dovey!
Hubba-hubba!
Kermie, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
And I didn't mean it when I said that it would have been better if we had never met.
In fact, I wish we'd met much sooner.
Just imagine.
Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we'd known each other when we were little?
Imagine...
Little Kermie.
Little Piggy.
No matter what life may bring
No matter what I may do
Be sure of one special thing
I'm gonna always be loving you
Gonna be a movie star
And I'm gonna learn to drive a car
Gonna be a veterinarian too
And I'm gonna always love you
Hi, guys!
Hi, Fozzie!
I'll be the cutest model you ever saw
And then I think I'll study criminal law
And I'm gonna learn to scuba dive too
And I'm gonna always love you
Well, I'm gonna be a singer
And I'm gonna learn to fly a plane
I'll be a doctor of diseases I'll help you with your sneezes
And practice neurosurgery On your brain
Gonna climb the Matterhorn
But only after All our children are born
'Cause I want to be a good mommy too
And I'm gonna always love you
She's gonna be a movie star
And she's gonna learn to drive a car
She's gonna be a veterinarian too
And I'm gonna always love you
Well, she's gonna be a singer
And she's gonna learn to fly a plane
She'll be a doctor of diseases And help you with your sneezes
And practice neurosurgery On your brain
Gonna climb the Matterhorn
But only after All my children are born
'Cause I want to be a good mommy too
And I'm gonna always love you
Piggy, I think the ride is over.
- Bye, Jenny.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care.
Well, here we are.
And it sure is nice that we're all together like this, isn't it?
Miss?
- Is customer!
- Coming!
Excuse me!
I will get it.
After all, moi am a waitress.
Pete, thanks for giving Piggy a job.
Rats cooking, is frog washing, is pig waitress!
Is no coffee shop.
Is zoo!
Hey, Kermit, come on.
What about the show?
What are we gonna do next?
Is mailman come with letters for you.
That must be more from the gang.
I'll have two eggs, dry toast...
Pardonnez-moi, dear.
Is something wrong?
Do you believe in interspecies dating?
I've gone out with some rats, if that's what you mean.
- It's from Gonzo.
- Great!
It goes, "Dear Kermit:
I'm in Michigan."
Camilla and I have joined a travelling aquacade.
It's not Broadway, but I have met some good-looking chickens.
We put together a terrific act.
Ladies and gentlemen!
The incredible Gonzo!
Thank you!
Arriba!
And, thank you!
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd!
And now, for today's climactic act look yonder!
I will first make a death-defying leap from the loop-de-loop ramp spinning and hurtling my body through the flaming circle of doom and landing comfortably on the imitation-leather easy chair while my chickens do their impression of Tony Bennett singing the "William Tell Overture."
Please! I must have silence!
Are you ready?
Thank you, Margaret!
Hit it, girls!
Here we go!
Oh, wait, I can't see.
I forgot my skis!
Don't sound like Tony Bennett to me.
"So everything's going swimmingly.
Love, Gonzo."
Hey, here's one from Rowlf.
Dear Kermit:
How's the Frog?
I'm in Delaware, and I found a terrific job in management.
I'm surrounded by friends, and I love what I'm doing.
I am Mr. Skeffington.
My secretary made a reservation for the weekend in the name of Snookums.
Oh, yeah.
This is Snookums.
Daddy wants his little Snookie-ookums to be especially good this weekend while Daddy is gone or he'll be very angry.
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.
Him!
- We'll take good care of him.
- Snookums is a him!
Snookums gets breakfast at 8 a.m. Exactly.
- Breakfast is quiche.
- Yes, sir.
Aren't you gonna write it down?
Photographic memory.
Write it down!
"Dog gets quiche at 8."
Whatever that is.
Marvin, put him on the desk.
Do you have any toys around here?
What kind of toys would you like, sir?
Doggy toys!
Rubber balls. Rubber fire hydrants. Rubber newspapers!
Snookums prefers rubber Wall Street Journal to the rubber Washington Post.
Don't we all?
Write it down.
Yeah, rubber Wall Street Journal.
Now, while Daddy is gone the little lumpy-dum-dums won't have his Daddy to give him washy-scrubby.
Very impressive. You speak Chinese like a native.
Now, shake hands.
- Beg your pardon?
- Shake! Shake!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good boy!
Now sit!
Yes, sir.
Stay.
