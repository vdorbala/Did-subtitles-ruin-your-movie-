Luke, you're up next!
Showtime!
Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes on the two-ton metal mesh of madness.
And here he is, folks.
The one, the only,
Handsome Luke and the Heartthrobs.
Watch as they defy gravity and centrifugal force at 3Gs.
Watch, as they ride their motorcycles upside down within inches of each other, at speeds you can hardly comprehend.
Come on, everybody, give it up for
Handsome Luke.
Here we go, folks.
Come on, give them a hand.
There they are.
Come on, get 'em goin'.
They're working hard for you.
We know him as Handsome Luke.
There they go, warming 'em up.
Let's hear it.
Come on, give them a hand.
Handsome Luke!
Okay.
I gotta go.
Hey.
Do you remember my name?
Romina.
I like to call you Ro.
What are you doing now?
You got plans?
I gotta go home.
Want me to give you a ride?
Thanks.
You don't wanna talk or anything?
You know, I leave town tomorrow after we pack up.
I'm not gonna be around for another year.
Another year?
Yeah, you wanna get a beer or something?
I got someone, so no.
Just wanted to see you again.
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the one, the only,
Handsome Luke and the Heartthrobs.
Hey.
Is Romina here?
No.
Hold on.
She's working.
Okay.
Do you remember me?
Yes, I remember you.
Who's that guy?
He's yours.
You wanna hold him?
There you go.
His name's Jason.
Hey.
There you go.
Thanks.
Good?
Great.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Anything you wanna tell me?
Anything you think I might wanna know before I leave here forever and I never come back?
Let's go outside.
Come on.
You weren't gonna tell me?
It was just a fling, right?
That means you don't gotta tell me?
Just as, like, a common courtesy or...
There might even be a law, you know, you gotta fucking tell somebody.
I haven't heard from you in over a year.
You just took off.
Never called me.
I gotta leave in four hours.
I don't know what to do.
You do whatever you need to do.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna do what I have to do.
I'm going to school.
I take care of Jason.
I work here.
And I have a man.
So that's what I'm doing.
That's my life.
You're busy.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real busy.
Well...
I don't wanna keep you.
Okay.
All right.
When does this pay period end, Jack?
On Friday?
Why?
Because I gotta get paid.
Just pay me for half the week, all right?
I don't give advances out.
I'm not asking for an advance, Jack.
I'm quitting.
You can't quit.
I just did.
Hey.
Hey.
Wow. You look like a princess.
What are you still doing here?
I stuck around.
This is really not a good time.
No?
No.
I was just gonna take him to the park or maybe see if I could just sit on the porch, just say hi to him.
We're on our way to church.
Going to church?
This is Kofi.
- We need to go.
- Yeah.
You should call.
You can't just show up, you know?
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hi.
You live here?
Yup.
This is my house.
How long you in town?
I'm gonna stick around.
What are you looking at?
Really, you gonna do this shit today?
Do what?
Is it your will that Jason should be baptized in the faith of the Church,
- which we all have professed with you?
- Yes.
By God's gift, through water and the Holy Spirit, we are reborn into everlasting life.
In His goodness, may He continue to pour out His blessings upon these sons and daughters of His.
May He make them faithful members of His holy people.
Jason, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
This child of yours has been enlightened by Christ.
He is to walk always as a child of the light.
God, the father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, has freed you from sin.
We now anoint you with the Chrism of Salvation as Christ was anointed priest, prophet and king.
So may you always live as a member of His body, sharing everlasting life.
Amen.
In the name of this child and the spirit of our common friendship, let us pray together in the words our Lord has given us.
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
The Almighty God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit bless you.
Amen.
Now, as we receive our new member into our parish, let us all welcome him with great joy.
Ride that thing really good! Really good!
You ride good, man.
Would you like a ride into town?
Save you some gas, man.
Just passing through?
I'm just settling in.
Where you staying?
Some fucking motel.
Yeah.
They are no good around here.
Whole town's gone to shit, man.
So you got a job?
No.
You know your way around an engine?
Yeah.
'Cause I got a shop, repair shop, on Washout Road.
You should come check it out, man.
I could always use a good worker.
All right.
It ain't much.
It's what it is, you know, but it's mine.
No one can kick me out of it.
So, that's the workshop in there.
This is Tula.
I don't get a whole lot of work here, you know?
But if you want, you can look for other jobs or whatever, you know.
If it's not enough for you.
I do everything.
Everything there is to do to a car, I know how to do.
Anything you don't know, I can teach you, you know?
And I got a trailer down here.
Stay there if you want.
Yeah, see?
She's shy.
She can't see so good anymore.
Where is it?
Where's the ball?
There's the trailer.
She get it?
No, she ain't gonna get it, man.
You live out here all alone?
Yeah, I live alone.
Sometimes people come stay for a while, you know.
That's it.
It's not much, but, you know, it's got whatever you need in there.
It must get lonely.
Look, Rob, I don't wanna be ungrateful.
I really appreciate what you're doing for me and shit, but I gotta make more fucking money.
Hey, man, if I could pay you more, I would.
You know, you're good at what you do, man.
Really good.
I could fix up that ol' Mack truck that's sitting there like a goddamn...
You can go ahead and fix it up, but I don't have the money to pay you.
You know, there are other things that could be done, you know.
Like what?
Well, you could rob a bank.
You're full of shit.
I'm not full of shit.
I've done it four times myself.
I stopped 12 years ago because it was getting too hot.
As long as you don't do it too many times, you're fine.
You got a kid, you wanna provide for that kid?
You wanna maybe edge out your competition?
You gotta do that using your skill set, and your skill set...
Very unique.
What do you say?
Go fuck yourself.
Well, good luck supporting your family on minimum wage.
He's my son and I should be around him.
I wasn't around my dad, look at the fucking way I turned out.
Look, I wanna take care of you.
I wanna take care of my son.
That's my job.
Let me do my job.
How are you gonna take care of us?
Don't say it like that.
But how are you gonna take care of me?
Don't...
Don't talk down to me.
It's a question.
I'm not talking down to you.
It's just a question.
I will find a way to do it.
You want a house, I'll get you a house.
You wanna get the fuck out of here, we'll get out of here.
I got that trailer.
I'll get a truck, we'll hit the road.
You pick a place you like, we'll stop.
You don't wanna be there?
"Fuck you," we're outta there.
What about my mom?
She can come.
And what about Kofi?
He can stay.
He can get his own girl and his own kid.
That's every man's right.
That sounds like a nice dream.
Ro...
You can, uh, use this.
If you wanna.
But keep in mind, man, I did four banks with a note.
In other words, you don't need the gun.
I never liked guns, man.
They're vulgar, you know.
But you may wanna take it.
I don't know.
Whatever you wanna do.
How do we do it?
Okay.
First thing is, we're gonna go in there nice and early.
Just when the doors open, okay?
You're gonna take a look at all the tellers.
Go for the oldest woman you can, right?
Failing that, go to the most meek.
You get her to put the money out on the table.
Why?
So, that way, you can see if there's a dye pack.
You put it in your pocket.
You don't hand anything over to them.
You don't show them the gun.
And you go.
Get on your bike.
I'll be about four blocks away.
Ride it into the truck.
Bam, we're home, we're done, we're rich.
What happens if you get stopped sitting by the side of the road with an open cube truck?
What are you gonna say?
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?
I'm an officer.
"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing with an open cube truck?"
"What are you doing? Why are you sitting here like this?"
Oh, I'm broken down.
I'm waiting for the, you know, repairs.
Thank you for asking, Officer.
That's a nice touch.
Right?
What are you gonna do if you get jock itch and, you know, you're riding 90 miles an hour down the street?
You're gonna keep riding, right?
Yeah?
I mean, we do what we do.
But when we do it together...
Shazam.
I'm just sayin'.
Not since Hall and Oates has there been such a team.
Which one are you?
Oh, I know.
So I gotta be the dark, curly-haired guy?
You gotta be the good-looking one?
I guess that's about right.
This is gonna be good, man.
You're gonna like doing this.
It's the biggest rush of your life.
All right!
Everybody who wants to live, put your hands in the fucking air!
Get over here!
Get over here now!
Get the fuck over here!
Get on your knees!
All right.
What's your name?
Max.
Max is my little fucking dog.
Everybody get your fucking money and he's gonna go fetch.
Get it out and put it on the table right now!
Get it out!
Pray!
Pray!
Let me hear you fucking pray!
Got that money out, boy?
Go fucking fetch.
Fast!
Get it out.
Put it in that bag.
They're not turning!
How much d'you get?
On, baby.
Oh! Beautiful fucking baby boy!
Are you okay, man?
You good?
You did it, man!
You did it!
Yes!
God damn it, we fucking did it!
We fucking did it!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Tell me about him.
What's he like to eat?
He, like, really likes apples.
But I have to kind of chew it up for him.
You chew up his apples?
Yeah.
It sounds gross, but it's not when I'm doing it.
Has he ever had ice cream?
Not yet.
You're fucking kidding me.
He's still a baby.
Bullshit.
What kind of house are you running?
No ice cream?
Why can't he have that?
It's not like he can't have it, he just hasn't had it.
Can I give it to him?
You wanna give him ice cream?
Yeah.
I wanna do something with him that's his first time.
I wanna look in his face when he tries ice cream.
Every time he has ice cream for the rest of his life, he's gonna see my fucking face.
Yeah.
Okay, come on.
Come on. No, he's funny.
Come on.
Wanna hear it on?
I'm sorry.
Here.
It's okay.
He cries a lot.
I'm sorry.
Oh, so you want the bike in it, too?
Yeah, just all... You know, so that... Just capture the mood.
It's a nice bike.
The bike's part of the family.
You want another one?
You sure I should take it when she's crying?
Okay.
That's a good trick.
Five, six, seven...
Put that fucking money on the counter.
Give me the real stuff. Don't give me the fucking fake stuff.
- I know what it is.
- Ten, 11, 12.
Let me see you... Come here.
Come here.
What is this?
What is...
What is this?
It's presents.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
It's a crib.
Easy, easy, easy.
Hey, boss, you gotta stay...
You're gonna fall off this bed.
There you go.
Your mom's home.
Hi, Mami.
Think she's gonna be mad?
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I got him a crib and some toys.
You know, this is really nice and all, but you gotta get this outta here.
- You can't just show up like this.
- Why?
'Cause this is Kofi's fucking house.
What?
Just get it out, please.
He can't be sleeping in a bed.
He's gonna roll out and bust his head open.
He needs a crib.
What's going on?
You okay with this?
I'm talking to you.
You okay with this?
Kofi, it's his father.
In our house?
You okay with him in our house?
What are you doing here, man?
Shh-shh. You're making him cry.
Don't shush me.
You in my house, man.
You need to pack all this shit up and get out the house, man.
I don't know who you think you are, just coming up in our life and changing shit around, but this ain't gonna work.
You gotta lower your voice, man.
Excuse me?
Lower your voice.
Romina, can you step outside, please?
Pack all this shit up and take it out, man.
You're making the baby cry.
You're making the baby cry.
Pick this shit up and get it out the house now, man.
I'm not fucking with you.
Pick up all this shit, man.
Fuck you, man.
Kofi.
Kofi.
Baby!
- Mami! - Kofi!
Oh, God, baby!
Baby.
Kofi, baby.
Baby.
Get off him.
You're crazy!
You're fucking crazy!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Please, please, please, no, no, no.
Okay.
Call an ambulance.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's over.
It's over.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's over.
Right here.
Is your name Luke Glanton?
Yes.
Mr. Glanton, a complaint has been filed.
It alleges assault in the second degree, which is a felony in the state of New York.
When such a complaint is filed, you have the right to an adjournment to obtain a lawyer.
Counselor, do you wish to waive any further reading of the arraignment?
We would, Your Honor, and on behalf of my client,
I'd enter a Not Guilty plea.
Given the history that I am aware of, of this defendant, and, as well, the allegations, I'm going to set bail in the amount of $2,500.
Bail may be posted either in cash or by bail bondsman.
In the meantime, I will issue the temporary order of protection requiring this defendant to refrain from violent, offensive, assaultive or harassing conduct and to remain away from the complainant until further ordered...
There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.
I wanna do two in one day.
I wanna do the Trustco on Brandywine.
And when all those fucking pigs are coming after me, I wanna split out the back, I wanna go down to Rotterdam and I wanna do that First National.
You know something, Luke?
If you ride like lightning, you're gonna crash like thunder.
And I'm not gonna let you bring us both down.
Fuck that.
Don't be such a fucking pussy.
No, man.
It's over.
Can't do it.
Won't do it.
You made your fucking choice.
Fuck you.
Hey, you know what?
If you go out tonight...
Take the truck.
You'll be less visible.
Last favor I'll do you.
I'm done.
You're fucking done?
Yeah.
You're done?
It's over.
Ro.
Just take this.
Just take it.
Ro, I'm sorry.
I'm a fucking maniac.
Ro, just take it.
Ro.
Can I get in the car, please?
Just take this.
You don't love me, you don't like me.
I fucking get it.
I'm a piece of shit.
Okay?
I'm still his father.
I can give him stuff.
I got this for him.
Just give it to him.
Tell him it's from me.
You're never gonna see him again.
Please give that to him.
Hey, it's okay. It's all right.
Open your mouth.
Wider.
You owe me a new bike.
Right?
Yeah.
Where's that bail money?
Give it to me.
I'm sorry.
Fuck.
Fuckin' Christ.
Shit!
Fucking idiot.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
You, get up!
Get the fuck up!
Fill up that fucking bag full of money.
Don't look at me!
Put your... No faces!
You!
Get up! Get up.

Okay, here it comes.
What are you doing!

Throw it over!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Where's that guy back there, your fucking guy?
Hey, guy!

Throw that over, and you better not fuck this up.
Jesus Christ.
This is fucking shit.
Get the fuck down!
Shit.
Shit.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

Hey, honey, don't... Don't...
It's all right.
It's all right.
Don't do that.

Hey, hey, hey, honey, just...
Not... AL: Avery.
Hey, honey.
Avery!
Avery, you got a bad injury.
You gotta take it easy.
It's okay, honey.
Just gotta relax, okay?
ALI All right?
We're all here.
Okay, okay, yeah.
You understand?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. JENNIFER:
It's okay.
Hey, baby.
We're all here. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. You just gotta rest...
You're gonna be in here a couple of days. All right?
That's it.
A couple of days.
Good morning, Mr. Cross.
You feeling up to a couple of visitors?
There's a couple men who wanna speak to you.
Avery.
Hey.
How's our hero?
Chief.
How you feeling?
You all right?
I'm good, yeah, yeah.
They taking good care of you?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sausage and pepper. Thanks for coming out.
From Sabatiello's.
Oh, how are you?
Bill Killcullen, DA. Avery Cross.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, of course. I know who you are.
I know your father, you know.
Long time now.
I apologize.
No, not at all.
He's a great guy.
I wouldn't have expected anything less from his son, but this was above and beyond.
I just did what anybody would do, right?
That's right.
And better.
I don't know about that...
The whole force is pulling for you, man.
Don't you forget that.
They're all outside. Banners, everything.
What happened to that guy?
That guy's gone.
He's dead. It's over.
That's the way it happens.
Yeah, but did he leave anybody behind?
That's not... It's not for you to worry about right now.
We got people who are gonna talk to you about that.
There's people talking to his family.
Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.
All right?
Yeah.
Bill wants to ask you a few questions.
Is that all right?
It's just your first impressions, that kind of thing.
- Just what...
- Formality, you know?
Yeah, it's pretty simple. Yeah.
Sure.
All right, I'll leave you two to get to know each other.
Oh. All right.
So what happened when you were just outside the door?
Um, I said, "Police, drop your weapon."
Um, "Face down on the ground with your hands spread."
And, uh, nothing.
Nothing, right.
Nothing.
Did you announce yourself again, or not?
No.
No, that's all we need to do is make ourselves known, right?
Yeah, but it's sometimes not easy to tell whether they've heard you making yourself known.
You know what I mean?
Anyway, you were yelling.
Is that right?
I was making myself known as we were trained, correct.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Then what?
At that point, I knew that I had to make entry, and I kicked the door down.
Was then. Was the door locked?
Correct.
And you knew that because...
What do you mean?
You just assumed that the door was locked?
How did I know it was locked?
Yeah.
Is that a trick question?
No. No.
I'm just wondering why you didn't turn the thing.
That's how I knew it was locked.
Did you tell me that?
No.
Okay.
All right, so you kick it in.
Right.
Why are you... Why'd you come down here?
I'm sorry, why did I come down here?
Yeah. Why wasn't somebody else...
A slow day at the office or...
No.
What happened after that?
What would you like me to tell you?
I just need you to tell me what happened.
You do?
I don't want you to misremember so, tomorrow, you're trying to match what you half-thought today.
I only want you to tell me what you saw and what you remember.
I shot the perpetrator, he fell out the window.
I know that.
When did he pull his gun?
Did you shoot him first, or did he shoot first?
Don't fuck with me.
Do the right thing, tell me what the fuck happened.
It was pretty quick.
Who shot first?
His hand comes up, you fire?
His hand comes up, he fires, you fire?
Right.
Like that?
Yeah.
Like pop-pop.
That sounds like he shot first.
Yeah.
Well, it's just a triumphant day for Officer Avery Cross.
He left Ellis Hospital well enough to go home and happy to be alive, with supporters from his Schenectady PD family cheering him on.
His father, State Supreme Court Judge AI Cross, says he's very happy his son is alive today.
There's the life of a cop, the life my son chose.
Twenty-nine-year-old Cross hadn't even been on the force for a full year before he ran head-on into the alleged Moto Bandit.
Pursuing Luke Glanton through the streets of Schenectady after a bank robbery, Glanton ran into a home, then he came face-to-face with Officer Cross.
You okay?
Glanton fired at Cross, hitting him in the knee.
Cross fired back, killing Glanton and saving the hostages.
Glanton was a drifter and, at times, a motorcycle stunt rider, and police say he had a very violent past.
The guy had a long track record, you know?
He was a professional criminal.
He moved here last spring, and he hadn't even been here for a full month before he started robbing banks here.
He leaves behind an infant son.
Coming up, Dallas and Denver...
Was it scary, honey?
Happened so fast.
I don't think there was time to be scared.
Scary for me.
I just don't understand why you're doing this.
Nobody does.
Doing what?
What am I doing?
I was speaking with your father and we...
We both agree...
Of course he does.
I'm sorry.
I just thought that...
I'm a cop, Jen. I'm a cop. That's it.
There's no...
I just thought maybe after this, maybe you would've had enough.
Hey, there's no more to discuss.
That's all.
I just thought maybe you would've had enough.
That's it.
Okay?
Baby, you can't expect me not to think that.
You guys just don't get it.
You guys just don't get it.
I'm sorry. We're just worried.
We're just worried about you.
Stop saying that.
That's all.
Stop fucking saying that.
Have you been replaying the incident in your mind?
Not really. Mmm-hmm.
No, I'm trying to put it out of my mind, I think.
Does that work?
Yeah.
You think you're ready to go back to duty?
Yes.
Would you want yourself as a partner?
Absolutely.
What have you been thinking about since the shooting?
Not much, um...
Everything's been so crazy, you know, with the rehabilitation and work and everything at home.
Mmm-hmm.
Everything at home? What's happening at home?
Well, I'm there now, which is much different.
Who's at home with you? Um...
Well, uh, my mother-in-law, uh, my wife and my boy.
So there's, um...
You know, it's been hard on my wife.
It's a shock.
And then, um, it doesn't help that there's a... You know, a baby around.
But it's okay.
I mean, it's okay.
What do you mean, "it doesn't help that there's a baby around?"
Well, I just mean, with everything that's... That's going on...
Just trying to... To get all this in order, uh... Before I can take care of that.
It's been...
I've just been so busy that it's been hard to, uh...
I have a... I have a hard time looking at my son.
And that's something new, since the shooting?
You know, I saw in the police record that this perp also had a 1-year-old son.
His name is Jason.
Have you been thinking about this?
This?
You mean...
The fact that he had a boy?
Yeah. Do you think you're having a hard time looking at your son because you're thinking about this other little boy that won't have his father?
You expecting someone?
No.
You?
Hey!
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Hey.
Hey, how's the gimp doing?
Hey, come on in, guys.
No, we're just coming in here to check up on you and see how you're doing.
Hi, how are you, Jen?
I'm good.
How are you, Scotty?
Oh, I'm all right, doing good, better than this guy.
Oh, he's okay.
Come on in.
How you doing?
Hey, Pete, how are you?
Good.
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.
Did you ever meet my wife, Jennifer?
No. Hi.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
Hello.
Hey, how are you?
Know Doc?
Yeah, we've never met, but Avery Cross.
How you doing?
Good.
How you doing, pal?
That's my wife, Jennifer.
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
You guys hungry?
No, we're... We'll just leave you to it.
No, come on in, have some dinner.
No, we didn't come here for dinner.
We got plenty of food.
Come on in.
Well, I...
There you go.
Oh, yeah.
Glad we decided to do this.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you guys came.
Here you go.
Thanks.
So how's it feel to have the hero home?
Probably can't wait for him to get back to work, huh?
No, it's great having him home.
I just thank God he's okay, you know?
God bless that.
I think we should toast on that.
- To our hero.
- To hero boy.
- Hero boy.
- There you go.
Glad you're okay.
I've been on the force for 22 years, pulled a trigger maybe three, four times.
You're on for six months, you already got one in the bag.
And he was white.
That's an extra 50.
Oh, better him than me, right?
- Hey, you got that right.
- Absolutely.
You guys have any plans for tonight?
No, we're just...
This is it.
Yeah?
This is the big plan, having you guys here for dinner.
Would you mind if we stole the hero for a little police work after this?
Tonight?
And we'll have him back by curfew.
I don't know, honey, you should probably rest tonight.
Maybe tomorrow night.
Yeah, we kind of need him tonight.
Is there a problem?
What about your leg, or...
Well, we're not gonna be running.
We'll carry him.
What are you gonna do?
We just wanna introduce him to a bunch of people who really admire him for what he did.
They just wanna congratulate him in person.
Good, yeah, that sounds good.
Leave in about 20 minutes?
Not that we wanna eat and run, but we are on duty.
No, you should go.
That's a great idea.
I'm sure everybody would love to meet you.
Yeah, there you have it.
You're a hero.
I hear a little sarcasm in your voice.
Me?
Yeah.
He is a hero.
Yeah.
He's a hero around here, that's for sure.
You don't mind if we take him then, do you?
Not at all.
I think it's a great idea.
Yeah, all right, there you have it.
You're released.
Release the hounds!
Yeah.
Hey, Avery, does she sometimes, like, tuck her balls up, at least at night?
Hey, Pete?
Pete?
What?
- Can you pop the trunk?
- Sure it's okay with her?
Scott, you know I'm not on active duty, right?
Yeah, we're aware.
It's a little gift we got going for you.
Let's go!
Police.
Yes?
Hi.
Romina Gutierrez, please.
That's the woman, right there.
Romina.
Yeah.
Hi. Hi, I'm Officer Deluca.
Romina Gutierrez?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're here to search your house.
What for?
For evidence.
Evidence for what?
We're looking for the money that Luke Glanton may or may not have given to you.
Yeah, well, we don't have anything that...
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah, I can.
No, you can't.
Why's that?
'Cause it's my house.
Look, you assume that I have a warrant, and I'll assume that your mother has papers, okay?
This won't take long.
- Come on.
- Kofi.
- We're just gonna start upstairs, okay?
- No, no, no, no.
No, no, my baby's upstairs.
My baby's upstairs sleeping.
Your baby's...
Yeah, my baby's upstairs sleeping, so, no, we're not gonna start up there.
No, no, no, don't go up there.
Romina, hey, relax, relax, relax.
He can't go up there.
Yeah, he can.
You can go up there if you want.
But if we find evidence while you're up there, you're under arrest.
For what?
We've done this a lot of times, okay?
It'll be quiet.
Go on, Scotty.
Be quiet.
How about a cup of coffee?
Yes, yes, yes.
That'd be great.
Is it all right if I go into your living room here?
Yeah, go ahead.
Thanks.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Romina, let's go.
Come on.
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?
Hey, this is crazy.
Wait outside. I don't want...
No, we gotta go.
This is fucked-up.
Why the fuck are we here?
Let go of my arm, man.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Let go of my arm.
Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
Shut up.
- How long did you know Luke?
- A couple years.
Did you know he was robbing banks?
No.
You didn't know that at all?
No.
Let me just ask you one more time, because this is what we do.
You have no knowledge to this money?
No.
Officer, I swear to God.
It's not here?
No.
It's not outside?
If I was gonna hide something, I would hide it closest to my heart.
Scott.
Pick him up.
Pick up the baby.
I don't think we should do this.
I don't wanna wake him. I don't wanna pick him up.
Pick him up.
I'm good.
Put him back and let's go.
What's up?
Yeah, they're clean.
All right-y.
We'll get out of your hair.
What do you got there, Scotty?
Come on.
Help him out, will you?
Scotty, stop. Stop.
You gotta give me a chance to count it.
You gonna count like that, we're gonna be here till 5:00 in the morning.
How are you gonna count it?
Got a money counter in your asshole?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fourteen grand.
$14,000.
Well, it's not gonna be an even split because the lion's share's going to our hero.
Consider it unofficial hazard pay.
From us to you.
Enjoy it.
'Cause you're not gonna get it from the department.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.
Not bad, huh?
Not bad for a night's work.
We're gathered here to celebrate a cop who makes other cops proud.
We can all rest a little easier at night now that he's on the path to recovery.
Ladies and gentlemen, Officer Avery Cross.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chief.
Thank you for your support.
When I was in law school, we used to always talk about justice.
We'd have discussions about justice.
That's just what they were...
Discussions.
I joined the police force because I wanted to work alongside the brave men and women who know that some problems can't be solved by talking.
Now, no one wants to be in the situation I found myself in a couple weeks ago.
I certainly wish that it turned out differently.
I'm not gonna lie.
Sometimes I even wish that maybe it wasn't me that was called upon that house that day.
But that's the job.
And I can't think of another line of work that I'd rather be in.
Thank you.
How's it feel?
I'm not sure it's doing much good.
How's the spotlight?
I'm ready for it to end.
Look, don't worry, it will.
You know, the police always put on a big show when something like this happens 'cause the hero card's the only one they have to play.
I'm not really thinking about that, Dad.
I'm just trying to get back to work.
You know, Avery, if you planned this, it couldn't have turned out any better.
But you're not gonna make it work for you in the police department.
I promise you that.
I didn't come here to be lectured, Dad.
You tricked me.
You said the pool would be good for my knee.
Sorry.
You know, I'm not as calculated as you.
You know, my life's not a campaign.
It's much simpler.
Yeah.
Well, for somebody not campaigning, you gave a hell of a speech yesterday.
You certainly had my vote.
Plus, that knee's a goldmine.
No, I mean, a limp goes a long way in politics.
Look at Roosevelt.
Pull out the red carpet!
Get the flowers out!
Get all the flowers out!
Here she comes.
Come here.
I gotta go see the chief. I gotta go see the chief.
Why? I don't know.
I don't know.
Is it bad news? Think it'll be bad news?
Say hi to the chief for me.
Gonna be goin' back down up there.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Stay off your knee.
Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy.
Got a call today from DA Killcullen.
Close the door.
The state internal investigation into the shooting of Luke Glanton has been deemed lawful.
Congratulations, Officer.
You can put it behind you, get back to police work.
The question is, can you go back out on patrol anytime soon, and if you could, can you be effective?
I don't think that I can.
That's okay.
You know what?
There's a lot of jobs to be done around here that, in ways, and you know that, in ways, are much more important than what happens out on the street.
I'm so glad you said that because, Chief, I've thought a lot about this and I think that I could be best utilized as a lieutenant in charge of special investigations.
There's a lot of restructuring within the division that I've actually formulated...
I can't fucking do that.
Well, yeah, of course you could. I mean...
Cross!
Come on.
You paid too much for your education to act so stupid, kid.
Well, I think it's the very fact that I do have an education like this that perhaps is the reason why I've thought about how restructuring the unit, the division, can actually benefit you, me...
Cross, I appreciate your ambition, I really do.
And I think... You know, I think you're gonna be a great cop.
You are a great cop.
You're a hero.
But at this point, right now, you gotta get back to real life, and in real life, you got two choices.
You can retire on disability...
I don't wanna do that.
All right, good.
I don't want you to do that either.
Or you could be reassigned at your current rank.
That's it.
You gotta work your way up, man.
Hey, man, heard you were down here.
Hey.
What are you doing?
What are you doing in plain clothes?
You didn't hear?
I made Vice.
Get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, man, I'm actually paired up with Deluca.
That's good.
What do you got for me?
Oh, yeah, couple mutts left this in the back seat of their car.
A leaky substance.
All right.
So when are we gonna get together, grab a little bite, you know, talk about some things?
Sounds great.
All right, man.
Page me.
Okay.
Thanks.
What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.
The only reason why I'm asking is 'cause you're my friend.
I don't know what I can do to help, but, yeah, what do you need?
All right. Right on.
Deluca and I have been working on this case, all right?
And I want you to keep this to yourself.
It's a little private.
And I don't want anybody to know about it, okay?
Okay.
Okay, Deluca and I are working with this fucking hooker.
We gotta fucking head her off with some coke.
So Deluca and I thought that, you know, if...
We need some temporary access to the evidence room.
We need you to get some shit.
We gotta hit this bitch off.
That's what we need.
I really tried to look out for you with that seven grand.
Now I need you to look out for me.
I'm serious, bro.
This is how it works.
Hey. Hey, don't worry, it's okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
I just wanna give you something.
All right?
Listen, this is the money that we recovered from your house, okay?
I want you to have it.
I don't know what that is.
You don't have to ever even see me again, just take the money.
I'm not here as a police officer, I'm here as a regular guy.
Listen, listen, listen.
Listen to me.
Get the fuck away.
You fucked up my son's life, therefore you fucked up my life!
Get the fuck away from me.
I should have brought this to you sooner, and I apologize.
This was recovered from a house during a search.
No, wait a minute, Cross.
It's just a small fraction of what's going on.
Wait a minute, Cross.
Don't say another word.
What do you mean?
No, no, no, don't say another word.
What do you expect me to do with this?
You're joking, right?
This is shit.
Chief.
This ain't my problem, all right?
This is your problem.
This is our problem of the fucking police department, and I'm bringing it to your attention because that's what I should fucking do!
Oh, yeah, is that right?
Yeah!
Is that what you should do?
Rat out other fucking cops?
Chief...
This is un-fucking-believable, all right?
Get this shit out of here!
Fuck.
Fuck.
Where you going?
I was going home.
You know that thing you and Scotty been talking about?
Yeah.
Sure.
Well, you and I have to talk about it.
Follow me.
What the fuck?
Fucking...
Oh, fuck.
Hey, Pop.
Avery.
There's a way out of this.
You're not gonna like it.
You wanna hear?
Yeah, I wanna hear it.
Let's start with the precinct.
Anybody there still trust you?
Scott.
We'll start with Scott.
Playing shortstop.
Looks good.
He's getting bigger.
Jesus Christ.
You really gave Deluca quite a scare.
He's ready to dump you, the whole thing.
Enough with these fucking tests, all right?
Either ask me to help you or just leave me the fuck alone.
I need you to go into the locker,
I need you to take the McKillen case out.
It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "McKillen" across it, okay?
I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag.
I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning.
If somebody asks you, "Hey, why is this lighter?" You say, "Hey, you know what?" "I'm a rookie.
You're a squeaky-clean fucking lawyer with a medal of honor.
Nobody's gonna question you, okay?
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.
No problem.
I knew I could count on you, man.
Yeah.
Tell Mike I love him.
I gotta go.
All right.
I need you to go into the locker,
I need you to take the McKillen case out.
It's a kilo, it's a big brick, it says "McKillen" across it, okay?
I need you to break off a chunk, I need you to put it in a bag.
I'm gonna come by, I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow morning.
All right?
If somebody asks you, "Hey, why is this lighter?" You say, "Hey, you know what?" "I'm a rookie.
You're a squeaky-clean fucking lawyer with a medal of honor.
Nobody's gonna question you, okay?
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.
No problem.
You shown this to IA?
'Course not.
Handing it to you on a silver platter.
Got any idea what this means?
Are you ready to do it?
Are you, son? Are you really ready?
'Cause they're gonna fuckin' tear you in half.
I'm gonna need your assurance you're gonna follow through with it.
Really?
And I'm gonna want full immunity when you do.
You can't just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do.
You understand?
And when you do, I wanna be made Assistant District Attorney.
I have a law degree and I passed the bar.
I don't have a spot for you right now.
Make a spot.
I won't do that.
I can't just snap my fingers and make you Assistant DA.
You can say no.
You can say no, I'll walk out this door, I'll walk over to the Gazette, I'll tell 'em everything I know, including this conversation.
Listen, you're not going anywhere.
Don't...
Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it.
All three things?
All right.
I'm not gonna promise you how long you're gonna stay there.
You're not gonna shake my fucking hand, pal.
I'll make you Assistant DA.
I'm never gonna shake your fucking hand.
You're too smart for your own good.
Come down, come here. Get right in there for a good shot.
Detective, how do you respond to these allegations?
Drugs, corruption and gangs.
It's not an investigation by the Schenectady Police Department, it's an investigation into the Schenectady Police Department.
Earlier today, DA William Killcullen announced that his office, along with the FBI, would be handing down indictments that would lead to the arrest of these Schenectady police officers.
The DA is making allegations today that the Vice officers were acting like the gangs that they were supposed to be busting.
Officers allegedly stole drugs and money, even guns from inside the evidence room here.
Officials say that, with that stolen evidence, the cops paid criminals to help set up their rivals, which then led to those headline-grabbing arrests.
The DA announced its star witness in the case today, hero cop Avery Cross, who, less than a year ago, was shot in the line of duty while trying to save two Schenectady residents from the alleged Moto Bandit.
In Schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton, News Channel 13.
- It's gonna be all right.
- Thanks, Jess.
It's the largest case of fraud this region has seen...
You know, when I was a kid, I used to look at my dad dressed in judge's robes and I used to think that my father was a superhero.
And I don't think I was far off.
He had that quality that judges have where they have tremendous compassion, but they're also ferocious at the same time.
He wasn't afraid of making enemies.
I think that's probably why he had so many friends.
I had the chance, right before he fell into the coma, to tell him that I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him.
And...
He shook his head, "No," and I didn't understand why.
So I leaned in close, and...
He could whisper.
And he said to me,
"I'll take the win, not the run."
That was my dad, that was AI.
Son, you wanna come with me?
Sure.
Avery?
Yeah.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
Close the door.
What's wrong?
We have to talk about AJ.
He wants to come and live with you.
He won't stop asking me about it.
Really?
I guess that's a good idea at some point.
I think, if he doesn't come and live with you, he's gonna completely go off the rails.
It's just right now, you know, with the campaign and everything, it's just not an ideal time.
I mean, what am I gonna do with him?
I don't know what he likes.
I just don't think it would be good for him or anybody.
I mean, come on, you know that.
No, well, you can tell him that.
Jennifer...
What am I supposed to tell him?
I just don't... Why are you doing this right now?
You can tell him now.
Tomorrow we're gonna head to Buffalo in the morning.
Wednesday is outer boroughs in New York City, and then the AI Smith dinner at night.
Do we have time to get there?
We do, absolutely.
We'll have our last event close in Queens, we'll hit the Upper West Side and then we have to be at the Waldorf.
How about Yusef, the driver we had for my dad? Can we get Yusef?
Yeah, totally.
What's going on in Queens?
In Queens, he's gonna do an event on environmental issues.
Yeah.
Talking about some of the... Protecting the Sound, and some of the environmental stuff.
And then Thursday head to Rochester for lunch.
You're gonna go to a place where you're gonna order something called the Garbage Plate.
Just want you to be prepared for it.
That's the picture.
We're gonna do that...
Did you see?
Yeah, no, I've seen it.
And then Sunday morning, black churches.
Oh, perfect.
Avery Cross?
Yeah.
AJ.
AJ?
Hi, AJ.
Yeah.
So what high school are you coming from?
Troy High School.
Yeah. You're coming from Troy?
Okay.
So not too far away.
What brings you to Schenectady?
Uh, my dad wanted me here.
Your dad wanted you here?
Yeah, for my senior year, he wanted me to move here.
What about you?
Did you wanna come here for your senior year?
I don't know. Yeah.
I...
I guess not, not really.
Do you know anybody here?
At the high school?
No.
No.
Don't know anybody?
Just... Just peek over your shoulder.
Peek over your fucking shoulder.
There.
Hello.
Hello. Hello.
You don't like them girls?
I don't know, maybe you're just used to it.
They ain't got girls like that where I come from.
You feel me?
Where are you from?
Troy.
Troy?
Yeah, you heard of Troy?
Yeah, I've heard of Troy.
Where's Troy at?
It's fucking right next door, dude.
Right next door?
I would've guessed you were from Long Island.
Where's that?
It's where people that talk like you come from.
B, I'm bored as a motherfucker around here, dude.
I've been here for, like, fucking three days,
I'm bored out of my fucking mind.
Welcome to Schenectady.
What do you dudes do for fun, nothing?
This is it?
This is what I got, for a year?
No, we got some things.
What?
Don't say, like, a mall.
If you say a fucking mall, B, like, I swear to God...
What do you do?
I get high.
We do some of that around here.
I could tell you smoked.
I seen you from back there.
You one of them loner...
Loner-stoners is what I call 'em, right?
You like to get high and, like, chill in your room and draw and shit.
So what you trying to do with the rest of this day, then?
You trying to go to math class?
You wanna go get high?
Let's go.
All right, let's go.
You know what this remind me of?
The Goonies.
You know that movie?
Where they're, like, all in a cave?
You want a cigarette, just ask, don't worry.
I'll take a cigarette.
I like smoking cigarettes when I'm high.
You like smoking when you're smoking?
You smoke menthols, man?
Like a breath of fresh air.
Like a breath of fresh air.
But you don't care.
You got the smoke puff blowing everywhere, I swear.
Yo, here we go, I said my spit is my MO.
My mouth is my gun, I shoot up your whole squadron with one flip of my tongue.
When did you write that?
No, I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.
Fucking quiet around here.
Shit, though, when I was a kid, there were always kids playing here, you know?
Oh, you came here when you was a kid?
Yeah, man, I'd come here with my parents sometimes.
Are your parents still together?
Yeah.
That's cool, they're still together.
Yeah, it's all right.
It's not my real dad, though.
Where's your real dad at?
Oh, he died, actually, like in a car accident or something.
Shit.
Yeah, this is kind bud, dude.
But you know where I could score some X?
Yeah.
For tonight?
Well, we just did our downer, we gotta get up.
Remember, come back by yourself.
All right?
Yeah, man, you got it.
All right.
Let's go.
Let me see it.
What?
Let me see the fucking drugs.
You fucking crazy, man?
Let me see my fucking drugs.
Fucking nuts, man.
What the fuck?
I gave you $500.
Yeah, that's 20 hits.
Yo, that's inflation in Scheneck, right?
Oh, yo, what the fuck, son?
Dead ass, the fucking 5-0.
Don't worry about it, man.
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Police.
Let me see your hands. Police!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!
All right! Fuck!
Interlace your fingers.
He was buying ecstasy from a Schenectady kid.
And who arrested him?
A couple of beat cops.
McCracken and Potter.
You know these guys? Mmm-hmm.
They'll sit on it if I ask them to.
Did anybody else see him come in?
No.
I made sure of that.
Did you get any sense that he knew this kid or...
Yeah, friends.
- Just the two of 'em?
- Yeah.
Okay.
What's this other kid's name?
Jason Kancam.
Got busted a few years ago for shoplifting.
- What's his name?
- Jason Kancam.
An aimless youth.
Gordon, can we kill the mic on Room 3?
Yeah.
Dad, I fucked up.
I know...
And I know you don't have time to deal with this stuff right now.
Not him, okay?
What?
I want you to leave him alone.
All right?
Okay?
Why?
Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me?
I want you to leave that fucking kid alone, all right?
Look at me. Look at me.
You wanted to come live with me, right?
You think this is easy for me, during this time, huh?
I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it for you.
You can have anything you want, but I don't want you to touch that kid.
You leave him alone.
Do you under-fucking-stand me?
Say yes.
Yes.
Look at me and say yes.
Yes.
Can you state your name for the record?
Jason Kancam.
Jason, how old are you?
Seventeen.
Are your parents here today?
Yes.
Yes.
Can you come up, please?
You're Jason's parents?
Yes.
Jason, you've been charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.
Counselor, do you waive a formal reading of the charges?
Yes, please, Your Honor.
In regards to my client's status, there has been a discussion with the District Attorney.
Your Honor, I may be able to have this case potentially resolved today.
So I'd ask that the court put it on for second call.
Second call.
This is a C felony, so Jason could do anywhere between five and 15 years.
But I'm getting the impression from the prosecutor that they may be willing to reduce it today to a misdemeanor.
The offer on his particular case would be time served, which is the day he spent in jail, and a fine, and that would be it.
Can he come home with us today?
He can.
Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody's looking out for you.
Look, I didn't mean to get you busted the other night, all right?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it was a pretty shitty fucking night.
But don't worry about it.
I was out of there in five fucking minutes, dude.
You think I'm gonna sit there and get fucked up the ass all night?
And what happened when you got home? Huh?
Went upstairs.
Tried to go to sleep, but I was still trippin' like a mo'fucker.
Why, what happened to you when you got home?
I'm cool, man.
Your moms was all worried and shit?
Oh, man, my mom's...
I'm cool, man.
Really?
'Cause I saw that guy today.
What guy?
Your dad.
That's your fucking dad.
When did he move in?
What the fuck you talking about, AJ?
Just wanna know.
I figured out...
What the fuck's your problem?
What the fuck's your problem?
Chill, dude.
Chill. What's your problem, AJ?
Just fucking around.
Don't be so serious.
You got a fucking temper, B.
You need to watch that shit.
It's gonna get you into fucking trouble.
How was school, Vanessa? It was okay.
I had trouble with math.
Hey, what's the deal with my dad?
What?
What, did you like really hate him or something?
What was his name?
I'm not doing this.
What was his first name?
I'm not doing this.
How come Mom never talks to me about my dad?
I'm your father.
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.
It's her business to talk about it, not talk about it, you know?
Grandma used to tell me some.
Yeah?
What did she used to say?
She said, like...
Just that he was, like, an outlaw.
You know?
Sound cool to you?
I don't know.
He's not your father.
Not really.
Just some guy with a baby.
I'm your father.
Been there since you were born.
I will always love you.
Can you at least tell me his name?
Hello?
Yeah?
I'm looking for Robin.
Yeah, I'm Robin.
What can I do for you?
I was hoping to talk with you about Luke Glanton.
I'm his son.
You're Luke Glanton's son?
Yeah.
Well, come on back, get a beer.
Bet it's down here in this box, if I remember rightly.
God.
That guy's your dad.
That's him there.
And that's the pig there, the one that bagged him.
What happened to him?
Who, the cop?
Oh, forget about him, man.
Don't... Don't start there.
I'll show you good things. I'll show you good things.
Come on.
You are standing right where your dad used to stand and we used to talk.
He was a good guy, your dad.
Oh, wow. Yeah, those glasses. I haven't seen those in a long time.
They're his, those goofy glasses.
These were his?
Yeah.
You can keep those.
He would've wanted you to have them.
Was he good at anything?
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle rider I've ever seen in my life.
The best.
Yeah?
Best. Never seen another one like him.
Best.
He was like nothing.
Rare.
Were you guys good friends?
Yeah, I think we were.
You still got his bike?
No, his bike's gone. Yeah.
Police took it.
I think they cut it up, you know.
They were angry with him.
I know that.
They were real mad with him.
I can show you some other things, too, if you want to see more.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why don't you put the glasses on?
For sure, he would've said they were left there for you.
No doubt.
Put 'em on, if you want. Go on, put 'em on.
Yeah?
Come on, I'll tell you.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah? Yeah.
You're calling him back.
Jason!
Jason.
Let me talk to you.
Look, man, I wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened earlier, all right?
I was a dick.
I won't deny it.
You lost my money, all right?
Like, that's... I think that's all I need to really fucking say, all right?
But I'm willing to fucking squash it, okay?
If you do the squashing, I'll be the squasher.
I said I'm sorry, brother.
I meant that shit.
What you thinking?
Okay.
You dig?
Okay.
We good?
All right.
Dude, dude, yo, listen.
I'm having a fucking party at my pop's place tonight.
Dude, my pop's is fuckin' off-the-chain, B. Come along.
I can't do that, man, I'm sorry.
Can't make it tonight.
You got family stuff you gotta do?
No, but I got stuff I gotta do.
Nah.
You wanna squash it, right?
We squashed it, man.
So then come tonight.
You want me to come to your party tonight?
I want you to come to my party.
Is that what you want?
All right, cool, I'll see you tonight.
All right. Hold up.
I'll see you tonight.
Another one. Hold up.
Do me a favor, B.
Bring some Oxys, all right?
Then we straight.
No, man.
What you mean, no?
You gotta make it correct.
I'll see you, man.
Nah, nah.
You're not...
I'll see you, okay?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We ain't seeing shit.
You coming tonight?
Yes.
You copping my Oxys? Yes.
You got it?
All right, sounds good.
All right, sounds like a fucking plan.
It don't gotta be $500 worth, you know.
Yo, J! Keep your head up, bro.
Same insurance and everything else with all that stuff?
- Yes.
- All right.
All right, I'll get to work on this for you right away.
Be right back.
How'd you make out with the weather?
We did all right. A little water in the basement.
- Made out pretty good.
- Yeah.
So much water in my basement from that flood that the whole house is gonna have mold in it.
Okay, looks like I've got everything I need on that.
Couple more things I wanna check in here.
Okay.
Processed here for you.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What the fuck are you doing?
You little motherfucker, get back here!
Get fucking...
You made it.
Hey, Oxys! Hey!
All right, I got one fucking question.
Who wants some fuckin' Oxys?
Hello.
There we go, there we go, there we go. Hello.
Who ain't got 'em?
Who ain't got 'em, hold your fucking hands out!
Take it.
Everything's slowing down.
You lost?
They're looking at you.
Who... Who is that?
Is that AJ's dad?
I think so.
Is everything all right?
You okay?
You got something you need to tell me?
Yo, what are you...
What do you gotta tell me? Huh?
You think I'm fucking stupid?
Yo, get the fuck outta here.
You think I'm fucking stupid?
Get the fuck outta here!
Think I'm stupid?
Get the fuck out...
What, you can't fucking hear?
What's your pop do?
Fuck's your problem, man?
Fuck off.
Here's the fucking door.
There, you motherfucker!
Get the fuck out.
Fuck you, man.
Fuck you and your old fuckin' pig!
Get the fuck outta here!
What's your problem?
Fuck him up. Fuck him up.
Calm down!
Jason.
Can you hear me, baby?
Vanessa, get your father.
Baby.
You're a liar.
He woke up?
He say something?
Hey, Jason.
Why don't you sit down and wait.
I'm gonna get the car. Okay?
What the hell happened to you?
Yo, I need your help, all right?
Yeah, man, all right.
What you need my help for, man?
I need a gun.
You need a gun?
Come on, man.
What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing?
Wait, wait, what are you...
Get on the floor!
Get on the fucking floor!
Oh, my God! Fuck!
All right. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. All right.
Are you alone?
What's going on?
Don't look at me.
Turn around.
We're gonna get in your car and you're just gonna keep driving.
Don't talk to me, or I'll shoot you in the back of your head.
Go.
Turn around.
Turn around.
How did you get into my house?
AJ let me in.
Is he okay?
Is he?
Give me your wallet.
Where's your wallet?
It's in my jacket.
Give me your jacket.
You want my wallet?
Here, take my wallet.
Want my jacket?
My jacket.
Get on your knees.
What did you do to my son?
Get on your fucking knees!
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Please, just tell me my son's all right.
This isn't about your fucking son.
I'm sorry, Jason.
I'm sorry.
It was a tight race for over a year between Cross and Kellerman, and then unprecedented events over the last month made to threaten Cross' election bid.
First, allegations of underage drinking at his house, and then a violent robbery from a yet-unidentified intruder that left his son hospitalized with a concussion.
Remarkably, Cross has managed to right his campaign, and now, as you see, the District Attorney has just won the election for Attorney General.
We will go live now as Senator McFarley prepares to address the crowd of supporters.
I've had the honor of knowing Avery Cross since he was a boy.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure and my greatest honor to introduce the next Attorney General of the state of New York, Avery Cross!
Go. Curtain.
All right, AJ, you gotta go. You gotta go out there.
There's a flag.
Go.
Go where the kid is. Go.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Avery!
Avery!
Avery!
Yeah?
Mr. Anthony?
Yeah.
Hey, I, uh... I called you, said I was gonna be out here today.
Oh, right, of course.
Yeah. Well, you're early.
Yeah. There's only, like, one bus headed out here.
So...
You're not from around here, huh?
No.
I'm headed out west.
So you ready?
Wanna go take a look at it?
Yeah.
I'll just get my coat.
All right.
All right.
It runs great.
It's got a lot of miles on it, but I kept up with the maintenance.
How much you want for it?
Well, I was thinking I need five.
All right.
You ever ridden one of these before?
Kill them.
If you kill it, it is I who will.
With a machete.
They will suffer greatly.
Do what he tells you.
You are now a rebel Grand Tiger.
We have 10 children ... 20 Kalashnikovs.
Hurry.

But thanks â magic, he was able to defeat the elephants.

Because his magic is so powerful ... he can eat men!
What are you doing?

He sees what happens in the night.
And it?

They made you mad.
Come on, get out!
We're going.
- Leave me alone!
- Come on, I say!
Listen to me.
Come on, we're going.
It is backward or forward?
Not a pig rowing better than you!
You say anything ...
We have already capsized if it was not for me.
Give me a white cock!
Are you kidding me?
Are you in love?
You want to marry?
Mom Angela!
What makes you laugh like this?
It seeks a white cock to marry.
You are completly cracked!
Where can I find a white cock?
Does not exist ...
It exists because I looking for one!
My father wanted to marry the most beautiful girl in the country.
He has requested, he has never found when he married my mother for 10 cows!
Well okay, where chickens here?
There is a loose-down barn.
- But there's no white cock ...
- Forget it.
Bastards!
You will slaughtered die!
I do not want.
We need a white cock to be together ...
The white cocks do not exist.
Your father lied.
All those whom I asked â told me.
The white cocks exist in your village.
And you refuse my hugs for a white cock that does not exist.
So I'm going.
My leg!
Stop your antics!
Money!
For the hospital.
You hit my brother.
You will pay!
Help!
Tell me ...

Sub-ttirage:
CNST, Montreal
Previously on Dance Academy...
I want you to both be prepared for the fact that I may be switching the roles.
You should stay with us over the break.
You and I can hang out. Just think about it.
I'm in.
Christmas Day.
Are your family seafood people or turkey?
What?
I'd love to come down to the farm with you.
You're going to have to go on, because I'm not.
You're better at this than me.
I think I like you.
I know I like you.
He's withdrawing his financial support.
If I have to get six jobs, I'm staying at the Academy.
You didn't make it into second year.
And finally I'm flying.
There's this dream I've been having, where I'm a competitor.
As soon as I start dancing, I know it's one of those rare performances where everything works perfectly.
There's not an arabesque I can't control.
For the first time, fouettes don't scare me.
But then a knot grows in my stomach.
This sense that I could keep turning forever or just as easily fall.
And when I wake up, I can't figure out if it's a dream or a premonition.
Couldn't sleep either?
He got me up.
You are such a pushover.
I know.
Come on.
Where are you two off to?
I thought city boy was going to help me!
It's our last day, Dad!
It's like the whole world could have disappeared and we're the only ones left.
Alright, Webster.
You realise at some point this year, we're going to want to kill each other.
Let's make a deal.
Nothing's getting in between us.
Deal.
But the classes don't officially start until next Monday, but they called us back early, and there's this rumour going round that they're going to announce the Prix de Fonteyn, so...
Hm?
The Olympics of dance.
They're on every four years.
Where have you been?
Er, the real world.
Do you remember in the interview when you promised coordination?
I'm a dancer, not a dish pig.
Make me proud.
My actions are mine and mine alone.
I am a nice person.
I am a kind person.
I am worthy.
I am lovable.
I am free!
Yes!
Well, come and collect your graduation plants.
Make sure you nurture them, like you will your own happiness.
For the record, playing your own music is egotistical, not ironic.
Darling, look at you!
Tash, hi.
Um, got to dash.
But you just got back.
Yep, but he's Myles Kelly, Kat.
Who gets sick of those dulcet tones?
Even you, Samuel, the 14th time he complains about no-one taking him seriously.
Even you. Sammy!
I made you some biscuits to settle your tummy.
Thanks!
You've been well occupied, then.
Well, Kat, I'm the boarding house adviser, so it's my duty to welcome the first year students.
Is that what you call it?
Oh!
Hey, man!
Hello!
Hey!
So how long, exactly, did the 'just friends' rule last?
Yeah, who caved first?
She did.
He did.
She did.
Second year.
Wow.
Did anyone ever think we'd make it this far?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no, it's fine.
My new holding cell's just around the corner.
It'll be like old times.
Good.
Alright, we'd better go.
Alright, well, have fun at school.
So your dad's still holding out on paying your tuition, then?
Yeah, it's all about clever use of holiday savings.
Don't know anything about the stock market, do you?
Sammy!
Check it out.
You're going to be the poster girl of second year.
Somehow I don't see Abigail letting that happen.
Tara!
Oh!
I put us down for our old room.
I hope that's not over-stepping.
Christian.
Sammy.
Wow.
Today we grow in strength with every forward step we take together.
Oh, this is Phil.
I'll see you guys in there.
Mr Lieberman, I believe the vernacular is 'get a room'.
See you.
You've all heard the rumours, so I'm going to get through this quickly.
For the first time in 30 years, the world's most prestigious ballet competition, the Prix de Fonteyn, will be held in Sydney.
Preliminaries are at the end of the semester, followed by the nationals, where it will be decided who goes on to represent Australia.
The Academy and the company have been asked to be part of the launch tomorrow.
Sebastian is choreographing.
The least I can do for the new principal of the Academy.
And the international judges will be in the audience.
I cannot stress enough that we will be representing the entire dance community.
This is your chance to make a lasting impression.
Mate, all of them?
You're going to get yourself in trouble.
It's pheromones, Christian.
Raw masculine pheromones.
Tara, I want you to do the solo.
I told you.
Thank you so much!
I won't let you down.
Ethan will take you through it.
Christian, over here, please.
Hi.
How are you?
Never better.
That should give me enough time to have some lunch and unpack my stuff and...
Sure.
You're really not interested in my schedule.
See you then.
Mum, hi, what's going on?
Some of this stuff is actually edible.
I thought we'd have a family dinner.
Oh, no can do!
I've organised a beach catch-up, but don't worry, these little guys will not go to waste.
You can't waltz in and out when you like.
This is not a hotel.
Ha-ha!
Where'd you get that one? Mummies For Dummies?
I don't understand what it is you want from me, Katrina.
I gave you a lot of freedom this summer.
I didn't say anything when you threw away your place at the Academy.
Don't worry, the disappointment rang loud and clear.
Mum, we both know the only part of me you've ever been interested in is dancing.
That is unfair.
Is it?
Then why are you sending me back to yet another boarding school?
You can't wait to get away.
Same sides then?
Unless you'd prefer the other.
It's close to the stairs, so there is the noise factor.
But it does catch the morning light.
Good.
You're both here.
This is my goddaughter, Grace.
She's visiting from London.
I'd like one of you to show her around.
I told her I was old enough to make my own play dates, but Lucy keeps me on a short leash.
I've been trying to convince Grace to get back into ballet.
Perhaps you'll have more luck.
New people.
I've been under house arrest for the last month.
What did you do?
My dad's getting remarried, and I upset the stepmothers.
And I grew up here, so...
Well, I'm Abigail.
This is Tara.
Hi.
She's the most naturally talented dancer in our year.
OK, what are you up to?
Mum's moved back to Brisbane to be with Dad.
They're trying to sort things out.
That's great.
I'm really happy for you.
And it made me re-examine how important relationships are.
I put undue pressure on myself last year by alienating those around me.
So you've decided to be nice?
Today, I don't have to be perfect, I just have to be me.
If I get a choice of chaperone, do you mind if I pick you?
Just let me finish unpacking and I'll come and find you later, OK?
Miss you, Samity-Sam.
Back at you...
Upsy-Daisy.
So that's what you're going to be doing this year.
I don't want to be tied down to just one girl.
I mean, I'm in my prime.
And it doesn't have anything to do with the other stuff?
Do you know it's more common than not for adolescents to question their sexuality?
It was a blip.
Just forget it ever happened.
Hey, listen, no offence to your tour guide abilities, but if I don't do something vaguely fun, my brain is going to melt.
Can you do me a huge favour and cover for me?
How do you mean?
Like if Miss Raine asks where I am, just make up an excuse.
Like what?
I am the world's worst liar.
Hi.
I'm Ethan.
Assistant choreographer.
Hi.
I'm... leaving.
You, complete faith.
Developing such a major girl crush.
Are you ready to get started?
Do you want to talk about anything first?
Since we're going to be working together and all...
I don't think there's much to talk about, Tara.
You said you'd stay with me over the break, and got a better offer.
But that wasn't what happened.
You chose Christian.
Again.
And I was left looking like an idiot.
Again.
So that sucked for about five minutes, and then I moved on.
So one more time - are you ready to get started?
Great.
Pose into arabesque.
You should see my new uniform.
I'm seriously thinking about shaving my head in protest.
Don't.
It suits you long.
OK, is it me, or does anyone else think it's going to be...
A strange year?
Yeah.
Look at this.
Oh!
Turn out, Tara.
That's looking sloppy.
Did you do any classes over the holidays?
Well, there weren't many available on the farm.
You're out of shape.
What?
!
Let's just go into the fouette turn, shall we?
You totally just said that I looked fat!
No, I didn't.
Don't be so sensitive.
Fouette turns.
You need to be consistent, Tara.
Get on your leg.
You're wandering.
Do it again.
You know that fouette turns freak me out.
Maybe we could make them attitude turns or something.
Yeah?
How about I decide that, since I'm the one who's coaching you.
No, you're not, you're punishing me.
And I know the choreography now, so I'm just going to rehearse on my own.
I mean, yes, he was sort of my mentor, but I'm not new and clueless anymore.
I danced Clara.
OK.
It's day one, and we're already talking about Ethan.
You think I was wrong to walk out of rehearsal?
I think, this year, you're starting out on top.
Which means any knock could feel like failure, right?
It's going to be tough to not let the small stuff get to you.
Aren't you meant to be uncommunicative?
Oh!
Oh!
There are 300 girls in my year.
I need to do something to make an impression.
You'll stand out, Kat.
What happened with you and Myles?
Oh, you just get to know someone way too well when you're stuck in a van.
And?
And... it was incredible!
We did little mini day trips to Byron and we swam with dolphins in Hastings.
That'd be so spiritually transcendent.
Yeah, but we weren't like that.
Who is?
Well, come on.
This is meant to be a reunion.
Hi, I'm Tara Webster.
I don't think we've met.
You have every right to be angry with me.
I forgot yesterday to say sorry.
So... sorry.
Soloists, join the company in the centre.
I want to run through the bows.
Tara.
We don't need you here.
Sorry, I thought you asked for the soloists.
We've found a replacement.
I'm sorry.
I'd hoped you'd make this more of a priority.
Sorry.
Tell me you mind.
I'm looking for excuses.
Not a chance.
Miss Raine would be too disappointed.
Principals first!
Camilla, come downstage.
Moving forward.
You know you gave me no choice.
You walked out of rehearsal.
You'll have to slot into the corps.
The Prix de Fonteyn judges will be in that audience.
This was my chance to make an impression.
I can't believe that you would just...
Just what?
Ditch you for a better option?
Great!
I, er, I was contemplating a head shave, 'cause these golden locks never have to be shackled into a bun again.
But Britney ruined that for everyone. Oh!
Pardon me?
Cat got your tongue, Kat?
Get it?
'Cause I'm Kat and... meow!
We seem to have misplaced some of the first years.
Lulu and Daisy, both sick with gastro.
Keep up, girls, keep up!
Wonderful!
The corps de ballet is dropping like flies.
Ethan!
Get a mop.
Those pheromones are toxic.
You've been kissing all of us.
I thought it was food poisoning, OK?
But I didn't know I was contagious.
The point is that you've been leading us on, pretending that we're special.
No, you are special.
You're all so... special.
Let me get that for you.
Thanks.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I do.
You want me to be jealous.
Really?
It all got so complicated between us at the end.
But I've been doing some work on myself over the holidays.
I know it was my fault we ended.
Don't blame yourself.
I was closed off to love.
But today, I release that fear and open my heart.
I'd kiss you if you weren't contagious.
I'll kiss you anyway.
Abigail, you didn't do anything wrong.
I must have.
I always do.
The reason that we broke up is because... I had feelings for someone else.
Then afterwards we can go stationery shopping.
Do you need a pencil case?
What, you're giving me the silent treatment?
How long is this going to last?
School starts on Monday, so not long at all.
Actually, I'm cancelling my tour commitments.
You're going to go to school as a day girl.
So I'll be staying at home, with you?
Someone has to keep an eye on you.
We'll just have to learn to be a normal family.
What is that... in your...
Is that a piercing?
Oh, it hurts, Mum!
How could you disfigure yourself like that?
And what sort of place would let a 16-year-old girl, without permission...
I'm calling the family lawyer.
So just to clarify, you broke up with me because you've got feelings for Christian.
And now you're hooking up with every girl in the school except for me because you care about me and not them.
Right.
So essentially I turned you gay.
And he turned you straight.
No, it sounds worse than it is.
It's...
You people with your feelings are messed up!
Move!
Tara.
How many fouettes is it again?
You did mind.
You should have said.
No, I loved it when you stole my solo.
When was the last time you danced, Grace?
A year.
Ish.
Right.
Well, you should know that Ethan's sending you out there to embarrass yourself so that he can prove a point to me.
Got it.
Don't.
I didn't say anything.
So when she danced in London, it was...
The Royal Ballet School.
I'm glad she's not staying.
Does that make me a bad person?
Nice is overrated.
Grace!
You were extraordinary.
Please don't quit permanently.
I was rusty.
Um, hey, can you say goodbye to Lucy for me?
Sure.
Where should I say you're going?
The airport.
Yesterday when I got there, there were no available flights to London.
But they've got me on business class tonight.
You want me to tell Miss Raine that you're flying to London?
I guess I'm homesick.
I think I've figured out that dream I've been having.
Last year I started out with no friends, no boyfriend, the worst in the class.
The only place to go was up.
Welcome to second year.
You are no longer new and the same allowances will no longer be made.
In second year, there are no second chances.
Girls, you're staying here with me this morning.
Gentlemen, I'm Zach Andrews.
You're next door with me.
This year I have everything to lose.
I can try to hang on, but I don't know what's around the next corner.
Come and stand at the front of the barre.
They cancelled my credit cards.
Dad's always one step ahead.
So you're staying?
For now.
I just have to trust that I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
Home.

Mom's calling you.
That's my spinning top!
Give it back to me.
I want it!
- Be careful, child.
- Father!
- I know what you want.
- An image.
Here, choose one.
Saint Luce.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
I have good news from the front.
General Philippe Pétain has saved France.
May God bring your father home quickly.
The terrorists attacked us from the rear.
The Reds are down.
My men have priority.
Take care of them immediately.
We'll do so.
We'll make them pay.
Call the personnel.
Clean him and bring him to me.
Sister Luce, make sure we're not short of blood.
Call Francheville.
I'll be in the OR.
Sister, take over.
Father.
Do you have the text?
I gave it to Your Eminence.
- Flowers on the altar?
- I'll do them.
The Prefecture, the Germans, the Milice, the guests of honor...
We need 3 more rows.
Hurry up.
Very good.
Thank you.
Martial!
I'm so glad.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
- Any news?
- There's a lot going on.
They're in Italy.
So we might be able to go home now.
We've been hiding here for 3 years.
Will you stay with us?
No, I can't.
I have had enough of you two.
It's too late to be sorry.
Father will confess you.
Later, I'll announce my decision.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello.
Sister Luce, you can go.
Sister Camille will join you in the hospital.
After you, Father.
The Krauts are coming!
The Bost is burning!
They're insane!
They attacked the FTPs in Borie.
Where are Pedro and Martial?
We lost sight of them.
Shit!
They'll get surrounded.
Gilbert, come with me.
We'll meet up at Brousses.
The others, follow Roger.
Pedro!
Sister, please, do you have any German soldiers?
Francheville, maybe.
I can talk to professor Charbonnier.
Very well, do it.
We need you.
There are more wounded up there.
Jeanne is leaving the convent.
You don't condemn us, do you, Luce?
Do not desist of our Lord.
I will pray for her and I will pray for you.
Come on, we have work to do.
Come on.
- I'll be right there.
- Thank you, doctor.
Have you seen Sister Luce?
Yes, she was with the wounded.
Sister, I need your help and require your discretion.
Can you get out of your tasks in town?
Sister.
Martial Lemonier was shot here.
We couldn't take him back to Brousses.
I've sent word to the the bishop.
- Hi, Marcel.
- Hello.
Pedro didn't make it.
There's no hemorrhage.
He has a weak pulse.
Prepare some morphine.
Clean the wound.
We need water.
It's serious.
We'll wait and see.
We need to move him.
There are more wounded.
He can not be moved like that.
The bishop.
He's unconscious.
Monsignor Kern, surgeon Belle.
Your Eminence, he should recover.
May God hear you.
We must keep him here tonight.
I'll place two men.
No, sister.
Keep on working.
Thank you for taking care of him.
- Has he regained consciousness?
- Not yet.
I'll take care of the other wounded.
Keep on nursing him.
If necessary, someone will take you to the camp.
Who are you?
I'm Sister Luce.
Be reassured.
The Lord is with you.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your...
Stop praying.
Please.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed...
I felt so close to you.
My Lord, forgive me if I have sinned.
When you're done, come to the community room.
Yes, Mother.
We like the peace in this garden.
It's very comforting.
- Did it happen again?
- Yes, Mother.
Sometimes, a vision imposes itself upon me.
Do you mean you saw in one of your injured men the face of Pain?
Maybe the shadow of Death?
Not only that, Mother.
A holy figure appeared in that look.
Like some sort of divine light.
Maybe it came from saintly images?
Sister, you're a victim of your imagination.
It's a very bad tendency that you should get rid of.
Your faith must be stronger.
We will work on it together.
Beware of those images.
And beware of your emotions.
They are deceptive.
Come along, sister.
Sisters.
Silence, please.
Now, let's hear the words of Marshall Pétain.
Fellow citizens, I need your faith.
Your heart's faith, your reason's faith.
I need your good sense and your patience.
You will have them with the discipline I impose on you.
- Look.
- Yes.
It was Jeanne's.
She left her notes and her belongings.
She hid them here.
I can't get rid of this.
We're going to be late.
Your apron.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, let's slide.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
Well, I'll do it.
Wait, let me help you.
- Let's go!
- Be careful!
Easy!
Here are the guns for the Bost.
Go see Paul.
We'll finally change these old guns.
We were lucky last night.
- You'll lose the stick tomorrow?
- I'll try.
- Are there no other newspapers?
- I have this.
Adrienne.
Take it easy, Martial.
I'll be fine.
It could be worse.
Pedro was not as lucky as you.
That's all.
- Put yourself first.
- I'm trying.
Gilbert will take you down.
He will take you to the bishop's.
While you're recovering, you'll be useful there.
They have announced the arrival of STOs.
And it won't stop.
Save a hood for the big hut.
The container, to the farm.
I'll reinforce the guard.
- Heard from Fred?
- He's starving but...
According to him, there are worse camps.
Tell him we will all make it.
Jacquou, come with me.
My husband isn't doing well.
Elder, Paulo, we'll hide the guns in the cave.
The surgeon told me you were here today.
I'm healing.
I'm doing better.
Thank you.
Thanks to the help from God.
Not necessarily.
Be careful.
It's an ugly wound.
I'm staying near the hospital.
I'm replacing a curate in the cathedral.
May the Lord be with you.
Amen.
I'm glad to see you're doing better.
- You'll be fine here.
- Thank you.
You will be able to help in the cathedral.
Don't expect too much from me.
As you sure?
This is my life now.
I gave up on many things after the exodus.
How could I still believe with all this chaos?
Precisely, faith is the only weapon we have to fight men's insanity.
I think one can act without betraying oneself or losing faith.
Not me.
I can't do it anymore.
I'd like you to read it.
"The Silence of the Sea".
I'd like you to read something, too.
Come with me.
It's a tiny library, not like the one in Strasbourg.
It's a sad time for writers and publishers.
Except for a few of them.
You have always been ahead of your time.
A more committed Church, the end of celibacy for priests.
And many other taboos.
Nothing has changed.
Do you know Bernanos?
Despite our weak world, he can't help but love him.
When I left, I promised I would take care of you.
It says: "It's terrible to fall into God's hands".
Martial.
Before quitting, think about your mission among our fellow men.
Surviving destruction like they did?
Next.
Come on, hurry up!
The lights!
We'll cut the straps.
Go up there!
- We need the parachute.
- Adrienne, do it.
Hurry up.
They will see us.
Jacquou, André, Michaux.
Turn off the lights.
Quickly!
Come on!
Come on!
- You're back already.
- Till tomorrow.
I don't like being there.
Martial!
We need to tell the Bost we got the goods.
Rouquin will wait for you at 3 pm.
- Better wear your cassock.
- OK.
Hurry up!
Come on!
Hello.
We were at Sarlat hospital.
Germans.
- Clodhoppers.
- A roadblock.
They're looking for résistants.
Don't be scared.
They took hostages yesterday at Razac.
Everybody out!
Open the bags.
Papers!
To the gate!
To the fountain!
We must block the back entrance!
The park is surrounded.
Be careful.
They're on the look-out.
Get out of here.
Close off the park!
Nobody gets out!
Thank you, sister.
Goodbye.
Hello, sister.
They told me in the hospital I could find you here.
You disappeared.
We had to go back.
I understand.
Can I talk to you?
- I couldn't have managed alone.
- It was God's desire.
I'll stay in the cathedral for a few weeks.
I might see you around, sister.
God, help me.
Unrest is overwhelming me.
This is why we meet on Thursdays.
Speak freely, sister.
Is it still about your visions?
I know Sister Jeanne's leaving affected you.
Mother, we nuns devote ourselves body and soul to the Lord.
- Don't we?
- Yes.
Mother, is it a sin surrendering to it?
Which temptation are you talking about?
A desire...
I experience it, and it upsets me.
Get rid of those emotions.
The Lord wants your soul to be pure and eternal.
Who better than you, a nurse, can know how the body is a poor, mortal envelope?
Take your things.
We'll tell you where you're sleeping.
You, in the barn.
- What's your name?
- Etienne.
Welcome.
Right, well...
You're going to stay here.
It's not far from the camp.
You'll receive military training and you'll go the maquis.
First of all... get rid of the stuff in here.
We'll need this room.
- How many in there?
- 3 or 4.
Is my family at risk? I refused the STO.
The officers will show up.
That's all.
The work in Germany is no longer a success.
- Tersner?
- Here.
That's over.
As of today, you'll drop your real name.
We'll give you new names tonight.
Alright?
We have some things to teach you.
You see this Sten?
If you forget the safety, you kill your friends.
Our contact in the prefecture sent it.
Lefort, Parade.
Almost everybody from east Bergerac.
Friedman, Rubens.
They'll take the Jews, too.
We have no time to lose.
Bastard was the Accordionist.
You must go to Bergerac.
We need to neutralize him.
Your job is to ensure the contacts there.
Victor!
There's no other choice.
Stay in the presbytery.
You won't take care of the musician.
We have to defend ourselves.
Our fellows are going down.
They're intercepting too many letters from Bastard.
- I'll take you.
- No.
I can walk.
I'll go this way.
It was easier working for you.
Luce.
Look at me.
I have news of Jeanne, from a sister in Evreux.
I can't forget about her.
I pray, but I can't concentrate.
I copied a text.
I have read it many times.
I know it by heart.
Listen.
"I am in every one of you,
"like every one of you is in me.
"You'll see my eyes in those of your beloved.
"And in the love you give them,
"you will find the love I have for you.
"Love is one.
"Love is pure and knows no filth.
"From the darkest cave,
"its light shines up to heaven".
My Lord, I leave it up to you!
I can't handle this powerful force!
Guide me.
I'm here to see Father Martial.
Father Martial is doing a replacement in Bergerac.
What is it about?
Nothing important.
Luce.
What's the matter?
Are you alright?
Let's take a seat.
Easy.
Breathe.
Are you feeling better?
- What happened to her?
- She wasn't feeling right.
You scared us, sister.
And it's such a beautiful day!
I'm feeling better.
I don't want to lose you.
I'm so happy here.
We have great need of contemplation.
This retreat will help us cement your faith in Church.
You'll tell me how to organize the confessions.
Of course.
It's the sister I told you about.
Come in, sister.
Come closer.
Right.
Your devotion has made you expend yourself without reserve, between the convent and the hospital.
You need to rest.
I thought a break would be beneficial.
Your mother is worried about you and I agree with her.
I've decided to grant you a three-day permission.
You will visit your sister and your mother. You will give them my regards.
You'll go to Bergerac tomorrow.
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
I knew you would show me the way.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like to see Father Martial.
Father Martial is not here.
I have a message for him.
You will have to come back.
Come back later.
Have a good day, sister.
I'm sorry... When will he come back?
I told you, I don't know.
He's not here.
Come in.
I'll see what I can do.
Is it urgent?
Come on, over here.
We will take a photo now.
There's the Accordionist.
We're at home here, at Barnabé's.
We'll stay till tomorrow.
They will dance.
The Jerries are in town, they won't stay long.
I'm alone, I need you to stand guard.
How come?
My colleagues are stuck in Bordeaux.
So what do we do with the Accordionist?
Take him to the local chief.
They'll question him.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I know her.
So it's important?
No, I can't talk to her on the phone.
Alright...
Wait!
Find her a suitable outfit.
I'm sorry for the clothing.
It's necessary.
Come.
What's the matter?
Come with me.
I needed to see you.
I beg your pardon.
I had no other choice.
I struggled, I prayed.
I want to know the truth about my feelings.
The war has upset you.
You're losing your way.
I don't think so.
You are misjudging me.
Besides, it's a bad time.
Give me some time.
I will know then.
I'll get you a room and take you back to Bergerac tomorrow.
Come.
Have you eaten?
A present for the newlyweds!
Candy?
It feels strange, doesn't it?
It suits you.
Where are we heading?
Nowhere.
I'm confident.
My steps have never betrayed me.
If they did, it would be the Lord's will.
I would be the one to blame.
- Long live the newlyweds!
- Long live the newlyweds!
It shouldn't be long.
You will stake out.
I'll approach him.
Hey!
We have some questions to ask.
You'll have to come with us.
Who are you? What do you want?
You will see.
Leave me alone.
Don't be a fool.
Come help me!
Hurry up!
What are you doing?
We're out.
Martial.
I would like to pray.
God sees our love.
Our love?
What love?
I have it in me.
- Love knows no filth.
- Please.
Do you understand?
Religion is over for me.
I'm ashamed of what I stole from you.
I gave it to you.
I will help you.
I ask you nothing.
Nothing.
You can't help me. Nobody can.
You are wrong.
Haven't I been by your side already?
That's true.
I know this place.
This is what I wanted you to see.
God chose me here.
Our source!
It's still alive.
Taste it.
Nobody can lose their love for the Lord.
They can, when man interferes.
This war will end someday.
Look.
My sister was good with the top.
It was paradise here.
I give it to you.
Have trust, Martial.
Holy is his name
His mercy extends from generation to generation
To those who fear him
He has performed mighty deeds with his arm
He has scattered those who are proud
He has brought down rulers from their thrones
But has lifted up the humble
He has filled the hungry with good things
But has sent the rich away empty
Show some ardor, sister.
Show some ardor.
Remembering to be merciful
Just as he promised our ancestors
To Abraham and his descendants
Forever
My Lord, you have been with me in every step towards him.
Why is he silent?
Listen to me.
You used to answer every one of my prayers.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to God and to you, Father, that I have sinned in thought, word, action and omission.
Through my fault, my fault, through my grievous fault.
I arrived late to a service because of my fault.
For lack of vigilance.
I lost my temper with Sister Marie-Véronique.
I ask her for forgiveness.
I heard you have some problems and you've talked to your mother.
The Lord has helped me overcome those doubts, Father.
Are you sure of that, sister?
Is everything back to normal?
Yes, Father.
Open your heart to the Lord.
I know God sees me and rules over me.
There will be 2 guys at rue Ragot.
Here, there will be 2 undercover FTPs.
We'll go for a staggered counterattack.
One, two, three shooters.
Let the Jerries think we're stronger.
Then we leave.
Etienne, you'll continue with Gilbert if the 1st group stops.
Martial, we'll need you in the cathedral.
No.
No, I can't.
It'll get ugly in Périgueux.
You won't take any risks.
Adrienne and Gilbert will.
Then, things will heat up.
We'll disappear and move the camp.
Understood?
Martial.
You'll join the bishop of Bayonne.
The funds transfer goes through them.
Then, the Spanish smugglers will take charge.
We really need you.
You did very well in Bergerac.
There's nothing to be proud of.
I heard Malraux, the writer, from the Spanish war, is in the maquis. When he talks about communists he calls them "the priests".
This is from the cathedral.
Nothing for you.
I'll be on my way.
- Take the tobacco.
- Thanks.
Are you alright?
- I'm leaving now.
- Sleep well.
Are you cold?
I hope I won't screw up.
It's a good plan.
You'll be OK.
Yes.
Damn war!
I'm scared to death, Martial.
I got your letter.
I can't stay long.
I've been thinking about you for days.
Everything reminds me of us.
I haven't stopped waiting.
- Don't expect anything.
- I know.
I can't resist this force any longer.
I have to go.
I will wait for you.
I keep this great trust God has given me.
Answer me!
Don't leave me!
Have mercy!
I will find you, my Lord, like the first day.
Sisters.
Our community will receive, on Saturday afternoon, Father Joseph at the chapterhouse, a Dominican from Bordeaux to talk about the importance of Gospel...
We escaped a massacre.
People from Toulouse helped the Spanish.
Gentlemen, they're out of danger.
But their wounds could get infected.
Your Eminence.
We're doing everything we can but we have some serious cases.
Gun wounds with risk of hemorrhage.
Be brave, son.
I'll pray for your healing.
Open elbow fracture with risk of gangrene.
Do not lose hope.
God bless you.
- Bravo.
- We just do our job.
Your Eminence.
- Everything's good, sister?
Your Eminence.
Is Father Martial still in the cathedral?
No, sister.
He's preparing to leave.
But...
He will come back, won't he?
He's my confessor.
You'll have to find another one because he's leaving for good.
They grouped the hostages to kill them.
We must expect the worst.
Alright.
In reprisal, we'll take tit for tat.
We can't stay here.
You'll go to Bayonne.
Empty this place.
Leave your things.
Don't take any personal belongings.
- We've emptied Brousses.
- Yes.
- Make sure nothing's left.
- What now?
- Take everything to the camp.
Roger, take them to the mill.
Guys, take as much as possible.
We'll see when we get to the mill.
Stop charging.
Victor, it's full.
We'll finish later.
Adrienne.
We'll finish tomorrow.
You staying?
Be careful.
What are you doing, Luce?
I'm leaving.
Why?
Because.
But why?
You're abandoning us?
You can talk to me.
You'll understand.
Luce!
You used to be devoted to our Lord!
- He knows.
- You're wrong.
You'll come back.
Your place is here, with us.
I don't belong among you.
Ouch!
Stay away!
Why this?
You didn't want to listen.
You betrayed our love.
Stop!
You hear no one but yourself.
Don't tell me the Lord brought you here.
I came because he let go of my hand.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
You're worrying for nothing.
She can't understand.
What do you know?
What happened could tear her down.
Anything can happen.
I'm going to the bishop's.
What about the curfew?
Go ahead.
I don't need your judgment or your prayers.
I won't pray for you. I'll pray for our sister's salvation.
How could you get so lost?
I have reasons to hate myself, but this is not about me.
I must leave the region.
Can you look after her?
I will.
Wherever you go, ask for the Lord's repentance.
You owe us the truth.
What did you expect to find beyond these walls?
What revelation?
You're not a novice.
You should be grateful we accepted you back out of pity.
Do you understand?
Luce!
It's me, Camille.
Luce.
Answer me.
Just say something.
This is serious.
Such a breach of the rules should be severely punished.
How has she reacted?
She refuses to talk, Your Eminence.
She hasn't eaten for 5 days.
We can't let her die.
Let's wait.
She'll return to the right track.
God has mercy.
Instead of blaming that child, lead her to redemption.
Your Eminence.
My child, we surely have our share of guilt in your torment.
I didn't imagine your visions would take you to such limits.
I authorized a visit.
Someone you love.
Come in.
I'll leave you.
Thank you, Mother.
My child.
I wouldn't be able to lift you up.
Have trust.
You have overcome many ordeals.
I know what you're going through.
Remember when the Lord welcomed you,
when your father died.
You must listen to me.
Me too, I almost...
One day, just like you... I went through that ordeal.
I thought God had abandoned me.
Leave me alone.
Leave.
My child.
You have to believe me.
One day, the Lord will speak to you again.
God will come to you.
Sister Luce, the bell has rung.
Let's go to the refectory.
You have to eat.
We'll go to the orphanage this afternoon.
We'll see the children.
It's alright, sister.
I'll do it.
Here you are.
You will feel better.
Like every week on Radio-Paris, here is Georges Apal's report.
You have been abandoned, lied to. You have been betrayed.
Betrayal by bad French people, those who multiply their crimes in their mother country.
Bands of criminals, demonic creatures whose only desire is to kill.
Beware of bad French people.
They will deceive you.
The traitors are among us.
They murder while wrapped up in the folds of our flag.
French citizens, you have not been sold, betrayed or abandoned.
Come to us with trust.
Look at the evil images.
They were behind your visions.
The Lord wants me to guide you to the path you need to find.
He'll only save you if you have faith.
The forces of evil are here, all around us.
You need to fight.
You'll overcome this ordeal by joining the forces of good.
Sister.
The Lord saves his worst ordeals for his best servants.
Luce.
Luce, calm down.
- No!
Stop!
- Luce.
No!
It's me.
You are with your sisters.
You're with us.
No.
He betrayed me.
- They're all traitors.
- Stop!
Not hate!
It's an attack by the Franco-German committee.
No "Jews" or "freemasons".
It's not them.
They are well informed.
Go to Brousses. I want names.
Come with me.
Vincent will let the others know.
Jojo, Fernand, Belleuil.
The guys from Toulon, too.
Warn them in Bost as well.
Get going.
We must find who's behind this.
It was posted yesterday.
Another letter could've escaped the sorting.
Gather round!
Just a second, children.
Sister Luce?
I'm glad to see you.
We have missed you.
When are you coming back?
Excuse her.
She's going through rough times.
Come on now.
Let's go.
My child!
Chase that torment away.
I want our Sister Luce back.
What's the matter?
We have all been denounced.
You too.
It continues.
Another one.
I know this writing.
We're all in danger.
We have to inform the bishop.
Martial must come back from Bayonne.
We can give you shelter.
No.
I have to keep on treating my patients.
I'll take care of the rest.
Go!
You must tell them what Luce told you.
It's your duty.
You can still save her.
Your Eminence.
You didn't have to come.
What an ordeal!
We had a runaway, now we have an abduction.
We think we know our sisters but they remain a mystery.
The children were...
Whatever dangers threaten us, only our Holy Church is important.
Yes, of course.
I heard a car, and when I...
When I turned around, I saw Luce being pushed in.
It was a black vehicle.
There were two men inside.
We know it's you.
We have proof.
Calm down.
Did you write those letters?
Yes.
- Are there any more?
- No.
Why did you do it?
Are you aware of the gravity of your actions?
Yes.
I was the one who wrote them.
Why?
That's my secret.
- The Milice!
- There too!
- To the back!
- The Sten!
Jesus Christ!
Over there!
Take the field!
Blast away!
They got us.
We took the field.
Calm down, calm down.
What did you see?
They were waiting for us.
Roger fell down.
Adrienne, Martial.
Bring her.
You lied to us.
You sent other comrades to death.
Your friends the Krauts!
You skank!
Will you answer?
Do as you please.
We will judge her.
Bring her back.
Acting out of spite is not an excuse.
I know.
What you say about other possible letters is overwhelming.
She betrayed the Church.
She'll answer in front of God.
But man's justice exists too.
Judging her means killing her.
The Church has its own prisons.
Tell her to join a monastery in Spain.
I'll do my best so she stays.
If she agrees, it will be a relief.
You'd have tried everything.
God save us all.
No, I won't go.
Why, sister?
You're forcing us to judge you.
Do you know what awaits you?
Yes.
Wait, stop.
It's nothing.
Go.
They must be close.
Find the sawmill in Beauronne.
The mill is down there.
Wait.
Just stay here.
You will be fine.
Sister.
You were offered a life dedicated to praying.
I don't understand.
Sister, I'll pray for you.
So you want to die.
I will decide that.
It's my choice.
Elder.
Félix.
Paulo.
Etienne.
Alright.
We will draw straws.
Ready.
Aim!
Fire!
Subtitles:
Previously on Dance Academy...
Welcome to second year.
In second year, there are no second chances.
Did anyone ever think we'd make it this far?
Sorry.
- No, no, it's fine.
My new holding cell's just around the corner.
It'll be like old times.
I put undue pressure on myself last year by alienating those around me.
So you've decided to be nice?
You people with your feelings are messed up.
Move!
Good, you're both here.
This is my goddaughter, Grace.
When she danced in London, it was...
The Royal Ballet School.
So you're staying?
For now.
Let's make a deal.
Nothing's getting in between us.
Deal.
My Nanna used to say... and she totally stole it from someone else... that the key to happiness was... having something to do...
Shh!
It's work.
Something to love and something to dream about.
Can you believe that's going to be us one day?
I used to think the moment I got into the National Academy, I would die on the spot with happiness.
I didn't.
Five seconds later, I just started focussing on the next dream... getting a contract with the Company.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm destined to always want something just out of reach.
Hi, guys.
I thought I'd get in early and let you know that whatever the initiation ceremony is,
I'm... I'm in.
I'm Kat Karamakov.
I'm new... obviously.
Minus nine minutes to make it to my shift.
That's doable.
Samuel, I do hope those outside work commitments aren't continuing now that term has resumed.
My point exactly.
Mr Reed, I've been thinking we don't spend enough time together.
So have I.
Your office?
Picture a universe full of shiny, happy people.
The boredom is palpable.
Hi?
Um, sorry again that we got off on the wrong foot.
I thought maybe I could take you over to the cafe, show you some of the least disgusting menu options.
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah, I would take anyone remotely interesting at this point.
Do I know you?
I'm Lulu and this is Lily and we've been dying to meet you all week.
You're a legend down in first year.
The Clara costume sabotage?
Emailing Tara's pros and cons list around the entire school.
Inspired.
Plus, you dumped Sammy Lieberman.
That rat infected all of first year.
So we've decided that you're the only second year with any clue.
No more relationships, just ballet.
Eye on the Company prize at all times.
If there's a point, could you make it?
We want to watch you and learn.
I appreciate your taste, girls.
I don't have time for minions.
Hey, good move.
You train them up and then they get power hungry.
It always ends in some sort of coup.
Week one results - you're at the bottom of every class.
Well, I'm still getting back into it after the break.
I want to talk to you about putting hip-hop back on the curriculum.
The Board made its decision.
The Academy trains dancers for ballet companies, not music videos.
But isn't it important that we learn all different styles?
What's important is that these marks improve.
As a scholarship student, you're expected to be a role model.
I want to see you putting in extra hours in the studio, cardio in the gym.
Try harder. Got it.
Mr Kennedy had great faith in you.
Don't let him down.
Excuse me, are you Saskia Duncan?
I hope so.
I saw you in The Firebird.
You were amazing.
Um, I've been carrying the program around.
Do you mind?
Sure.
And you are...
Tara.
Tara Webster.
Well, I... I don't want to disturb your lunch.
No.
Join me.
I miss Academy gossip.
So, Tara Webster, are you a good year or a bad year?
Um, I think we're kind of a mixed bag.
And do you have a boyfriend?
Yes. Yes, I do.
I remember my Academy boyfriend.
Hamish Maddsen.
He was completely gorgeous.
So much trouble, though.
So what happened?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm asking way too many questions.
No.
Um, the day I got my contract and he didn't was the end of everything.
We tour so much with the Company, there's not really enough time to be dating anyone outside.
So I hope your boy's committed.
To me?
No. To ballet.
Oh.
She's topped everything.
Every single class.
Who?
Grace.
You can't pretend that doesn't bother you.
Yeah, she's really good.
It's... it's unfair of them to let someone transfer into second year and disrupt the whole dynamic.
She doesn't want to be disturbed.
Abigail, we just wanted to say that you were robbed.
Wait.
You're looking for leadership?
Oh, we've found a leader.
We'll do anything.
Sew your pointe shoes, break them in.
Grace Whitney.
I want to know who she is.
Miss Raine's goddaughter.
Recently transferred from the Royal Ballet School.
Excellent extensions.
Not her Wiki page.
I wanna know how she thinks, what she wants, any weaknesses.
Know your enemy and know how to defeat them.
Brilliant.
It's open.
Hi.
Grace, isn't it?
Cool room.
Oh.
We're writing an article for the monthly Academy newsletter.
We thought a profile on why you chose to come to the school would be an excellent addition.
You're friends of Abigail's, aren't you?
Totally.
Take a seat.
Amaze-balls!
Oh, show me so I can do it better.
I see you listened carefully to our talk this morning.
Well, you said more cardio, right?
Clear the walkway.
It's a health and safety issue.
How?
Just clear it, Christian.
Well, can we at least use the studio, like, after-hours?
The studio is to be used for classical training.
Yeah, but if we have spare time, why can't we use it working on an increasingly relevant art form?
I'm relieved to hear you say you have spare time, Mr Lieberman.
You've been notably absent lately.
Clear it.
I guess we're taking that as a no.
So we meet after-hours.
Right?
The studio.
Yep.
Tomorrow. Ten.
If you're there, I'm game.
Yeah, spread the word too, people, alright?
Let the revolution begin.
You're here!
I like it when you're here.
Hi. This is for you.
So, how's the friend tally going?
You could have warned me about the socks.
Socks?
OK, so at normal school, if you wear them a centimetre too short, then you're trashy, but if you wear them too high...
Excommunication.
Yeah.
Sorry, what is this?
A pie chart.
It tracks all of your out-of-class activities for maximum time management.
I have one too.
They're colour-coordinated.
You pie-charted my life for me?
Well, if we both don't get into the Company, then Saskia says we have no chance of staying together.
I'm freaking you out, aren't I?
No.
Um... it's all part of your charm, right?
You were right.
The carefree attitude is an act.
She spends hours in the studio every night.
And she says she left the Royal because she wasn't the favourite.
Wait.
You got this information directly from her?
She's actually quite open.
And she said to say hi.
This information is compromised.
When I asked you to dig around Grace's background,
I meant without her knowing.
Haven't you ever stalked anyone?
I want friend requests out to every student at the Royal Ballet School.
Use a fake profile.
Cover your tracks.
I want the dirt on her family.
Why'd they leave Australia?
Why'd they send her back here?
I need to get into the school records.
Who knows anything about hacking?
My brother's studying IT.
Use him.
If she's hiding something, we're gonna find it.
Thanks for inviting me.
This is so exciting.
Um, are you sure it's OK for me to be here?
Yeah!
I always used to sit in on rehearsals when I was at the Academy.
It's the best way to learn.
You should come tonight as well.
Watch side-stage.
Really?
Could I bring someone?
Yeah.
Why not?
Lexie!
Girls, hi.
Look, I get it.
I haven't done my time, so you're supposed to ignore me until I'm completely humiliated and then one day I'll do something inexplicably cool and you'll accept me into your gang, right?
Uh-huh. Cool.
Well, look, we've all seen that movie, so how about I just hang with you guys until you make up your minds.
Actually, new girl, we've already made up our minds.
It's the socks, isn't it?
Sorry, is this your spot?
Oh, no, don't worry.
Make the most of it while you can.
You will never guess what.
Uh, they're putting a ban on public displays of affection?
Better.
Saskia has arranged for us to watch the Company side-stage.
Ooh, you should totally come too.
Again, who is Saskia?
The youngest principal dancer in the history of the Company.
When are we going?
Tonight.
Oh, no, we can't tonight.
Well, we have to.
It's the last performance of the season.
We've kind of got this hip-hop thing on.
I hope you're warm because we're starting in the centre.
What thing?
It's not on the pie chart.
Neither's the ballet.
Mr Reed, you know I hate to feel repetitive.
What did I say about focus and discipline?
Saskia's going to introduce us to some Company people afterwards.
She says it's never too early to start networking.
It was late notice anyway.
No-one's gonna come.
Yeah, but I cancelled my shift.
Two words, dude - 'thumb' and 'under'.
Well, I'm gonna call it 'compromise' and 'happy girlfriend'.
Do you wanna meet Saskia?
No, you go. She probably doesn't want too much distraction.
Didn't you see this already?
Two 'Firebirds', one week. That's dedication.
Good to know you're keeping tabs on us.
So Tara's doing a Frankenstein on you, huh?
I was wondering if that would happen.
Ballet, black tie event.
Looks like she's creating the perfect boyfriend.
My personality and your...
everything else.
Working late, Mr Lieberman?
If only your friend showed as much dedication.
OK.
The cloud has passed.
The cloud.
The Raine cloud.
It's code, Kat.
Where'd you all come from?
And there's more of us outside too.
I'm so glad you're here. OK.
Come on.
I know what happened in London.
You're seriously sitting in the dark?
And I'm guessing Miss Raine doesn't know, otherwise she would never have let you into the Academy.
Really?
You're a safety hazard, Grace.
So why don't you go upstairs, flush your creepy little fish, book a taxi and I'll leave your reputation intact.
Miss Raine is my godmother and the principal.
Of course she knows.
So give me the summary.
I got expelled for giving a girl a nervous breakdown?
Tell who you like.
I don't need to feel popular.
Neither do I. Hence the minions?
Look, I'm stuck here, but I don't care about being the best.
Everyone cares about being the best.
I'm not everyone.
You know, I thought you were interesting, but all this?
Not so much.
Two seconds.
I'm guessing no-one showed, right?
No, the opposite.
We need bouncers.
Even little first year ballet bods have shown.
Hip-hop is sweeping the nation!
Yeah, but they need a teacher, and someone who actually knows what they're doing.
OK. I'm sure you guys have it sorted.
Mate, you were the instigator, so you should be here to see it.
Sorry, I have to go.
What?
Why?
You don't need me here.
You're not just here for me.
Yeah, I am.
You've got your whole life mapped out in front of you and that's great, but don't overreact, but I don't even know if I want to get into the Company or not.
How can you not?
Wait, so you've been lying to me?
You don't wanna be with me long-term?
No, no.
See, that is overreacting.
Whether I want to get into the Company or not is two years away.
It's something I have to work out.
You're just scared to try.
OK.
Why don't you come with me?
Why don't you compromise?
Because this is important.
Exactly.
I wouldn't ask you to give up something that's important to you.
Hey, are you gonna teach us something?
Um, OK.
Well... do you guys want to, like, learn a routine or... specific moves?
You have to find your centre of gravity and then make it your own.
Hip-hop is not only about tricks.
It's about storytelling as well.
So we're gonna start like this.
Drop the curtain!
Ethan, ice, quickly, please.
Call an ambulance and someone get hold of Doctor Wicks.
I-I...
Give her some room!
Please, step back.
Take some big breaths. Come on.
It'll be alright.
Kat said you'd be here.
Also said you were amazing tonight.
I'm sorry I bailed on you tonight.
What happened?
They took Saskia to hospital.
She fell on stage.
One minute she was dancing and then the next... her career is probably over.
Oh, you don't know that.
Exactly.
I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow, let alone in two years.
I've been a total control freak.
I have a habit of throwing good things away.
