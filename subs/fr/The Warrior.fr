End his pain.
Cut a lock of his hair.
On our return to Korea,
I will return it to his family... 1375 AD 457 years after the founding of Korea,
Their 31st King, Gongmin, was assassinated by Hong Yoon and Choi Man-saeng. He was replaced by King Woo.
In China, chaos ensued after Chu Yu an-chang founded the Ming Empire in Nanjing, forcing the Won Empire from its century-old rulership of the land directly to the north of the Great Wall of China.

Stop!
They say the castle is too disordered... they will lead us to the temporary reception hall.
This place is huge.
This place doesn't look like a reception hall.
Something's wrong...
General, settle yourself.
I am General Choi Jung of Yongho's troop, the protectors of the Korea's envoys.
Where are Ming's officials to greet us?
Drop your weapons now!
Koreans murdered our diplomatic envoy then kept dispatching spies...
Now, you send us a military masquarading as envoys?
You will pay for it!
Tie them up!
Relax, don't panic.
Stay back.
Throw your weapons away! Those who disobey will die!
General Choi!
No, don't.
My duty is to protect the envoys.
General Choi!
Everyone, follow his orders.
General we are almost to the exile.
I'm sorry I allowed this to happen.
It's my fault...
No, this is where our destiny lies.
Exile is better than being in prison that suffocating prison...no, this is better.
But here it's... just too hot..
Hello
We are from Korea
We were sent to exile...
Are you a Mongol general
From Cokotemure's cavalry?
Now's not the time.
We don't have any grudges against Korea.
Ming's dogs, however, will die.
We leave you to your own fate.
Move out!
General, including the Ambassador we have 12 casualties. Among the 23 survivors, five are severely injured.
Have everyone gather their belongings.
Should we prepare to set up camp here?
Since the ambassador is dead, there isn't a point of continuing with the envoy.
That's absurd.
If we leave, Ming's troops will hunt us down.
- We'll explain to them what happened.
- Do you want to be kept in exile?
We should not leave.
We have to abide by Ming's orders.
We are the representatives of our country.
We do not carry any official letter or flag.
How can we prove ourselves?
Besides, Ming's troops will likely blame us for the murders.
General, we caught some horses!
There were two!
If we stay here we will die.
- Get ready to leave, immediately!
- Yes sir!
We're surrounded by an endless desert
Where could we go?
Back to Korea!
General, three are missing all the others are injured.
Let's find food and water first.
We're going to die if we stay here!
- Grab him, he's losing it.
- Let me go, let me go!
We are leaving.
General, we should look for the missing first.
This trip is too hard for me.
I always wanted to be buried by my home.
Are you in much pain?
Can't we rest here for a while?
No.
Even if we make it to Shandong we will still need a boat
I'll take care of it.
Get up.
What?
Yeesol!
General, please forgive him... he is a foolish one...
he only cares for my well-being.
He is a slave of the vice-ambassador.
This is the Great Wall.
To the east Ming and Yuan are at battle.
Below over here are where Ming's troops are based.
Avoid the village, avoid his troops.
We must eliminate any chance to meet anyone.
General, if we head north we will confront Yuan's troops.
What about here in the middle?
It's impossible.
By day the sun scorches the desert.
It will take at least twenty days to cross.
Our remaining food and water will last us only 6 days.
We must pass through.
We will cross within ten days
If necessary we will eat once a day and walk during night.
In that case, the southern desert is better. We can gain three or four days.
Whose territory is that?
It is abandoned land. No one has been able to conquer it.
However, my concern is the vice-ambassador
- He is already exhausted. - Everyone here is!
Everyone is suffering, he should be no different.
Get your ass up.
Slow us down and you will die.
That son of a bitch.
He is going to kill us all.
Did you call for me?
My body can't go on. It is useless to me now.
Take care of the group.
I hope you all safely return home...
I see.
I have one last request...
This man here... I relinquish my title on this slave.
He is now a free man. Treat him accordingly.
Please get some rest.
Hey you, stop there!
He stole food while standing guard.
I'm sorry sir.
Please forgive me!
There is no mercy for those in battle,
The same goes for those who steal.
Give them twenty floggings each
We only eat one piece a day, yet we are equal to your troops!
Give me the floggings instead of him!
Agreed.
You will receive the floggings for both.
Watch carefully!
You'd served in many battles with my father.
Would he be proud of me?
Times were not as difficult then as they are now.
But I am sure you will do well, sir.
Will we make it safely to Shandong?
Even if we return to Korea, people will ridicule us all.
I failed to protect the envoys. I failed to enter the castle of Nanjing.
This is for you,
Make use of it when you need it.
Take it.
Dying is better than this hell.
The vice-ambassador is gone.
Stop him and see what he carries.
The vice-ambassador has passed away!
Bury the body. The horse will belong to Yongho's troops.
You may bury him yourself, but we will take the horse.
General!
We're saved!
Good afternoon.
Please give us water and food.
Who the hell are you?
What should we do?
Should I tell them that we are Korea's envoys?
Don't, they're not going to believe us anyway.
If you want to eat, you'll have to pay for it.
- What are they saying?
- Do something.
We're starving.
- Say something...
- Relax!
I can't bare this.
Move one more step and I will kill you.
Are you from Korea?
Monk, are you also from Korea?
Serve food to these people. I will pay for it.
You have my thanks. I am General Choi Jung.
My Buddhist name is Jisan. I am glad to have company on the way home.
You, thief!
Get your hands off my property!
Mongolian soldiers!
Sir...
Why do you carry a Mongolian sword?
General!
A few days ago, we passed the battlefields
Only the dead lay there.
- Are you a Buddhist monk?
- Yes
Can you hold a ceremony for my dead warriors?
That can be done.
Do you have the names of the dead?
All my men were brave warriors.
Just write 'The Sons of the Blue Wolf'.
Treat the injured first.
The General is coming.
Please, eat.
Will you keep refusing food?
Did you hear that?
He called her 'Princess'...
"Help me"
My friend, what do you want for it?
Shit!
Who left this filthy thing here? You brought this shit here, didn't you?
Get rid of it, right now!
Don't kill him!
He's formidable with that spear.
Where are you from?
Don't move.
They might kill us all.
He has the eyes of a lion.
Take him with us.
- General, he killed five of my men!
- You'll receive ten horses.
May God bless you.
If you insist on travelling this path, I will join you.
No need for that.
I am familiar with these locations, I might be of help to you.
We're finished, shall we leave now?
No, we will wait.
Yuan's troops will pass through here.
We will save the Princess.
I thought we were headed back to Korea sir?
That was my intention until yesterday.
However, we are the diplomatic envoys
Saving her will allow us to enter the castle of Nanjing.
We could return home triumphantly after that.
A foolish plan!
Yuan's troops are the strongest in the region.
Please reconsider General.
I made up my mind last night.
Let us try...
Daejung!
We have to save Yeesol as well.
We will attack from both sides. Hall of us will attack from the rear.
The others will ambush them from the front.
- Now go. - Wait!
They're coming through now!
We will attack them all together!
General, we don't have any chance to win.
We can do it...
General!
Everyone hide!
Daejung!
Now is our chance!
Attack the horses first!
Save the Princess!
- Sir, wait...
- Damn it get away!
Fucking idiot!
I am General Choi Jung, protector of Korea's envoys.
Get up.
I am Princess Buyong.
Funny, what are envoys doing in the middle of the desert.
What is a Princess doing in the middle of the desert, your highness.
Take me to the castle of Nanjing as soon as possible.
Escort me there safely and the emperor will award you greatly.
Your safety is assured with us.
Your highness, board the carriage without any worries.
It is a total victory sir.
Are you okay?
You said you're an interpreter, right?
I am Park Jumyung... I haven't entered an official post yet.
- Deliver my words to that man in black.
Hey, the princess wants you to guard her carriage.
Sir, the princess wants that man to guard her carriage.
I have a mission for you.
Guard the princess's carriage.
I want to see where my master's grave.
You can talk?
Hey, he can talk!
I am ordering you again, guard the carriage
I am a free man now. I will do as I please.
General, don't be upset.
I don't need a slave who forgot his place.
But the vice-ambassador set him free, sir.
He was out of mind on the brink of death.
Once a slave, forever a slave.
That is the law of Korea.
Stop it!
Leave the bastard here.
Everyone, mount your horses.
General, there is one girl who survived.
She is a Chinese slut.
Leave her behind.
General, mercy is the virtue of a great man.
This is none of your concern. All decisions will be mine.
Take all with us.
General!
General!
The General is coming!
Honorable Cookoo
I lost the Ming Princess...
Soldiers from Korea took her.
Lay him down at my tent.
Princess,
it may be below you, but please eat this.
I didn't have time to say this before thank you.
Please get some rest, your highness.
I'm Yooran
Yooran?
Doesn't that mean 'the dancing orchid'?
That is the most beautiful name I've ever heard.
I am Park Jumyung
You have cute eyes.
Wicked little man... you have nothing else on your mind but to flirt with a woman.
What responsibilities do I carry?
I am just an interpreter.
Don't you understand? Those trivial readings are in vain...
What?
You Budhists ruined our country and accumulated all the wealth...
How dare you speak of Confucius as trivial readings.
Only fools believe Confucious is the best.
Hope for a joyous world lies in every teaching.
Confucius's words are spread throughout the world.
Open you eyes.
The first time I made a love was under the full moon
She was sixteen, I was eighteen.
Every evening we met on the hills...
Then one day, she became pregnant and we got married. Five days later I left to join this trip.
Was it a boy or a girl?
When I left, she was eight months pregnant. She might be in labor now...
I miss her so much.
Is he alright?
Get some sleep.
I will take care of him.
He will recover tomorrow your highness.
Where were you headed to?
To Korea, your highness.
The General's troops and yours don't seem to get along well.
In this kind of long journey many things might happen.
Take good care of him.
I will, your highness.
Do not worry about the vice-ambassador.
He was buried in a place of open sunshine.
Do you have any family at home?
I am alone.
From now on, you aren't alone.
We'll get through this together.
Ming will search every corner for the Princess we must head north.
Everyone get out, I have to talk with Rambulhwa
Do me a favor..
Anything...name it.
Ming kidnapped my sister. I want their Princess in revenge.
Bring her to me.
Why did you help me?
Especially after the Emperor sent you to exile.
Personal concerns and public duty are two different things.
If you help us see the Emperor,
I can resolve the misunderstanding about our envoys.
What is the name of that man behind us?
He is a just slave, your highness.
I asked you for his name.
They're coming!
They're after us!
Where are they now?
They're moving really fast, sir.
- How many?
- Over a hundred, sir.
We don't have much time. We must leave at once.
Escape to where?
We'll throw them off with the carriage.
Good idea sir.
Who will lead the carriage?
I will.
Give me two soldiers from Yongho's troop.
No, we can't sacrifice you or other warriors...
No, but I'm the interpreter.
And I never drove a carriage before...
He is too young, sir.
It has been decided.
Why is it always the Joojin soldiers?
Why do you keep quiet captain?
He doesn't even know his child!
Someone has to drive the carriage.
Put that boy on the carriage.
Captain Daejung!
We'll make them think the princess is in the carriage.
Wear this.
Please help me!
- You can help me, can't you?
Let me go with you.
Make a detour on the mountain, you'll see the Hwangho River...
We will wait for you there.
Please take this...return it to my master's family.
No...we will meet you there.
Take care of Dansaeng.
Protect the Princess...
Take this for good luck, I'll retreive it when you return.
Be careful...
Stop!
We will walk from here.
Keep the horses close together.
What if Dansaeng doesn't come back?
They aren't that stupid.
They'll come after us sooner or later.
I'll be right behind you.
The Princess isn't in that carriage.
There can't be only one soldier guarding her.
They are heading for the mountain.
Once they make it past the mountains it will be impossible for us to track them.
They'll eventually try to cross the Hwangho River.
Burn the village and the ferry beyond the mountain. Make sure nobody crosses that river.
Yes sir!
What about them?
Follow and kill.
Hurry! Let's go!
Stupid horse!
It's the Mongolian soldiers!
Dansaeng!
Throw that robe away and run...
Go, now!
Hurry, run!
Go!
Run!
Yeosol!
I'm sorry...
Get up.
I served two years up north, and two years to fighting the Japanese...
Altogether that's four years in the military.
When I got back, all that was left was rat shit in the kitchen.
So I went to the head officer and hit him on the head, bang!
So did they force you to choose between imprisonment or military service?
How did you know that?
It's obvious
Don't go back at all.
I heard that there is a Korean village in Beijing
I will go back no matter what
My wife is waiting for me
Guess your wife is pretty attractive?
She's like a fat bear...
Yet, for me, she is the prettiest in the world.
What about you?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not married, yet...
I see.
What happened?
As we expected...
Sir, come.
Even if it's freezing we can't give any signals to the Mongolians.
I'm sorry your highness, I didn't mean to wake you.
I had a dream...
I was already in the Royal Palace.
Once we cross the Hwangho River, we will escort you to the castle of Nanjing.
Daejung tells me that we're headed to Shandong.
Believe me.
I will keep my word, your highness.
Has the carriage returned yet?
I am sure it will, your highness.
They aren't here, sir.
Divide the soldiers into smaller groups and search the area.
What about the people?
Kill them as they have seen us.
I see no one at the ferry.
Double check to make sure.
Why aren't we going down?
First let's move through the valley.
Ha-il
Go check.
What is it?
The enemy is hiding near the ferry.
They'll kill anyone who tries to cross the river.
It seems that we have to give up Dungju as well as Nanjing
What the...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring them here.
They just followed me from the ferry.
Now Yuan's troops will find us at any moment.
We have to make them leave then!
Stop!
Stop it!
Don't you know what 'stop' means?
I never thought I would see you here, your highness...
I have something to discuss with both of you.
Let us cross the river when a night falls.
It is too far to Dungju.
It'd be better to go to Balhae Bay and find a ferry boat there.
Are you saying that we should cross the sea in a ferry boat?
If you can pass the Yuan cavalry, feel free to go alone.
After crossing the river, what if the General insists on escorting the Princess to the castle of Nanjing?
Are you crazy?
We have to return to Korea!
The Princess has brought us all problems...
Besides, now it seems we have to take all those people along as well.
We have a good news.
In five days we will head towards a fortress on the coast where Ming's troops are based.
If we escort the Princess and her people there... she will arrange for us a boat to take us home to Korea.
Let's accept her offer.
Let us wait for the carriage first.
Do you think they are coming back alive?
We can't get to Koyro without the boat... and with Ming's troops, we'll be safe.
Also, the Ming Emperor would know that we saved her...
Yuan's troops will never give up on the Princess. True, but we do need the boat...
I will follow your opinion, General...
Good.
Get up.
But..
we will wait for the carriage to return first.
We are in agreement, your highness.
I don't need pity.
It is not the time for pity.
Prepare to leave.
The Joojin troops stay here.
We will leave when Yeosol and Dansaeng return.
You've been in the military long enough to know what the result of disobeying a General's orders are...
General... we should wait until the evening passes.
Dansaeng's returned!
You're alive.
You alright?
Are you ok?
I've been waiting for you.
Welcome back.
It's stained with blood.
I am glad you returned alive...
I did not wish to award a slave such an honorable death.
The noble tend to have useless thoughts.
Shouldn't we arrange a horse for the princess?
She is not the princess of Korea.
The princess demands to ride in a palanquin! It's out of the question.
Get a thick piece of word, now.
It is foolish.
Daejung
Let's carry it.
But Captain...
Why should we carry that thing?
Someone has to carry it.
Hurry
My soles are as cracked as a turtle shell!
We don't have much time.
Shit.
I'll carry it.
~ the morning mountain home, the white bird sings a song ~
~ I want to hear the song, wish to go back home~
Quiet!
Yuan's troops are right behind us.
I'm sorry.
Your voice is louder than hers, monk.
She's just trying to comfort the children, why are you so picky?
Aren't you worried about the children?
You're pretty thoughtful for one who plays around with a prostitute.
If Yuan's troop catches us, those children are the first victims. And you'll be the first one who runs off.
What?
What do you know about me?
Silly fool.
Look at yourself...
We've walked all day, but have only covered 12 kilometers.
At this rate it will take us more than twenty days
I don't understand why we have to do this at all!
How can a young man like yourself have no one to wait for?
I don't have anyone. Really...
Any girl have your heart at least?
HA-Il, you miss your wife too, don't you?
He's still a bachelor.
How many times have I told you?
You haven't sex with a girl, right?
Why haven't you gotten married?
I took the wrong pills when I was young.
Yeah, he's still a child.
Would you like to try this?
No
Hey, hey...
Hey Granny!
Come back!
She's a distracted old lady
She has been out of her mind since her son was killed at the ferry.
How could we care for an old one like her?
Bring her here.
She is also one of my people.
Who are you?
Let me go
I'll carry her on my back.
Tens of soldiers are coming to this way, sir.
Did they find us?
I am afraid so.
Let's just take the princess.
If we take the others along, we'll all die.
He's right... We'll just take the Princess and Yooran.
We must keep our promise to the Princess
We bring all of them along.
Yuan's cavalry are faster than the wind.
Even the hunter cares for the animal.
Even hunters help animals who lost their way...
I will remain behind with them if you decide to leave.
Bastard!
Don't you miss your mother?
...She would be proud of me.
Let's go together, as far as we can.
Why aren't we leaving?
Yuan's troops are coming!
Let's go.
Order them to carry the palanquin...
Quickly... This palanquin is holding us back.
General...
- Who said so? Get out.
- They ask you to give up the palanquin.
Order them to carry my palanquin at once!
Stop!
The enemy will catch us if we allow her to ride on that palanquin.
Let us attack them first then.
Let's go.
It's foolish to chase those who are chasing us.
I make the decisions here, You just do as you're told.
Cavalry have less of an advantage in the forest.
Keep pace a meter behind me.
If we lose track you will be alone against the enemy.
Are you afraid?
Stay here until you hear something. You can rush out then.
I will go down instead of you, General.
Watch the hill.
If we allow them to pass, the Princess will be lost to us.
On my signal, everyone rush them.
Do exactly as i say, understand?
Dansaeng.
Yes.
Is that you?
We'll take care of things here. Go and protect the Princess.
Look, Byuljang is coming.
This is very important.
Please make sure it is delivered.
Trust my husband.
Now, go.
They are coming!
Go, hurry!
Be careful!
Move, Princess!
The Princess is over there.
Stand back!
Stop it!
Don't move!
Take away your filthy hands, you slave!
You could have killed me!
I'm a Princess!
Stop screaming!
Don't assume you're better than all of us because you're a Princess.
Leave me alone.
Take this.
Byuljang...
How are you feeling?
Where are my troops?
Help me up.
What happened to the enemy?
Daejung wiped out them with the Joojin troops, sir.
What about the Princess?
She is safe, sir.
We will resume the journey We are leaving.
It is quite late... and you must rest a bit more, sir.
it's better leaving early in the morning, sir.
I said get up!
If you wish to leave, go by yourself, sir.
We will get some rest and then leave
You have been the agitator all along.
Up to now I've let you have your way... but I tolerate it no longer.
- Leave him alone!
- Dochoong, Seat down...
General, please remove your sword.
How dare you!
Byuljang, arrest these men at once.
Now!
Look here...
Why don't we make Captain Daejung as our leader from now on?
That's the only way we'll reach the castle, right?
Dochoong!
General...
Pass your authority to Daejung.
You think we've come this far alone?
With everything swirling around us someone has had to make the tough decisions.
Did you know that?
I made these decisions on behalf of the group.
Anyone who tries to stop me will have their throat slashed under the name of the king
General, you are still recovering...
Did you know the one I want to kill the most is you.
Why doesn't anyone stop the General?
General, come back!
You may lead these poor people, but that doesn't change our situation.
Do you think all of this happened because of him?
I am not bright enough to know the future.
We should have held onto the General.
The only thing I desire most is for us all to go home.
We must leave!
Your highness, did you have a nightmare?
The fortress is not too far away, we must leave now.
But your highness, everyone is asleep.
Don't worry too much
He couldn't have gone too far.
Even if he wanted to come back, his pride will never let him do so.
This is Princess BuYong, I am being chased by Yuan's soldiers. I am headed towards the clay fortress.
Send the soldiers there immediately.
Wehae!
We will go around the forest.
We cannot sir.
If we don't go after them now, we will lose them in the woods.
Their destination lies at the end of the woods.
I vowed to return with the Princess.
We are all prepared to die in the heat of the battle.
The Mongolian are not afraid of death!
Not afraid of death!
Be careful, you carry a child.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Daejung!
How are the wounds?
The poison in his body is almost neutraliZed.
- Why aren't you helping the general up?
- It is not necessary!
I can get up by myself!
General, get up...
Do not call me a General anymore.
Regardless of what you say, you are still a general.
You've led this group well.
Please come with us.
Come with me.
A well!
Where are all the boats?
Where are Ming's troops?
We came all this way because of that bitch's words!
Now what?
It's not the Princess's fault...
Then whose fault is it?
Was it yours?
Stop it! How could any of us know this would happen?
Yuan's troops will be here soon. Decide whether we leave or stay.
Let's leave this place.
Close the gates!
Go get a bar!
Hurry!
Call a man who can speak Korean.
Listen!
For years, Korea has been the vassal of the great Won Empire.
If you hand over the Princess, we will let you all live.
Daejung, we are out matched.
The Princess is... none of our concern anymore.
What they want is me.
You have kept your promise, you have escorted me here.
There is no need for anymore sacrifices for me.
If you refuse to hand her over, we will destroy you all!
Daejung, you must decide.
Help us.
Huh?
The gates are opening.
So the great fighter is still alive.
He ruined everything!
Those who wish to leave may do so.
Honey, honey!
Pitch the tents.
We will prepare for battle.
Father!
Why the hell did you do that?
Daejung, I found the bamboos you wanted.
Hey! Get away, get away!
You still look pale.
It's alright, I wanna help you.
Water!
Come get some!
We have water here!
I'm so happy! They are going to strike quickly.
First, they will attack the gate. Then they'll surround us and climb in.
We have no defenses here.
General, please lead us.
I don't want to become a fool again.
Everyone knows why Koreans are outstanding in defense of castles.
It is because they had excellent leaders.
General!
I will fight by myself.
I was the one who made us head to Korea. I made us save the Princess... I started this all.
Whether we go home or not, fight for your name...
This is the time for all of us to unite.
It is none of your business.
This is my war.
Distribute liquor to the soldiers and let them sleep until the sun is fully up.
We have to capture the Princess and return to the base as soon as possible.
For the past three months, we haven't had a single day's peace.
We need to attack them quickly!
What if Ming's troops come...
Only two people know were are here. Us, and them.
How many of us will survive?
stay with me.
Wow!
Thank you brother.
It is relatively safe at the coast and sides of the castle. We need to protect the front.
Monk, take care of the Princess and the elderly people.
The Interpreter and I will take care the front gate.
You and Dochoong in the east
- Yeosol and HA-Il will protect in the west....
- Dochoong and I will cover the east
what about me, sir?
Dansaeng has something for you to do.
Don't come out, never!
You hear?
Stay there.
You'll be in big trouble if you make one move.
Don't come out...
Pull!
Whoa, you've made a ton of spears haven't you.
Huh?
They start to move...
Dochoong, don't shoot your arrows without my signal!
Wait until they come closer!
Shoot!
Yuan's troops are coming!
Sit down!
Cut the ropes!
Attack!
Don't retreat!
Keep your place!
Use your shields! Break the fortress gate! Go!
Daejung, Hurry up!
General, the messenger has arrived!
Stop the attack.
We received orders to withdraw?
Shit! What the hell? We're about to win!
Kill them all!
Saori...
Saori!
Look over there.., A white flag at Yuan's side.
It is to mourn the death of someone in high position.
If they attack again... We don't have a chance at holding them back.
General!
Why did you order us to withdraw?
Dig deep wells in the middle of the hill.
We were almost at victory!
Cookoo has passed away... Right after we left headquarters.
We will hold a memorial ceremony first. Then we will resume our attack.
Why did you leave your post?
Because of you, so many people died!
Stop your god damn chanting!
Please stop crying. We've beaten the enemy.
You family has been loyal to the Ming empire... for that the Emperor will reward you greatly.
Reward? !
You dragged us to die here! First my husband, now my daughter!
How dare you speak like that to the Princess!
You go!
Then, we're all safe!
Because of you, we're all going to die like dogs!
Byuljang!
What the hell are they doing?
The water channel is blocked
Everything will be over by tomorrow
Cookoo started a losing war.
The dreams of the great Ghengis Khan have faded away forever.
Don't say that.
Your words hold great influence over the fighting sprit.
Let us return to the prairies.
You mean we should just leave like this?
No...the Princess will be with us.
The children are waiting for you.
Why are they looking for me?
I have no business with them, right?
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
You told me that I was irresponsible, didn't you?
You were right.
I'm just a coward...a coward.
In this situation, it is more difficult for one not to fight than to fight.
If you disagree to useless cruelty, keep your conviction. Don't you think that is also courage?
At one time, I was a student of Confucianism, dreaming of the righteous world.
But for a countryman like me, I was not even given the chance to apply for a position of a government official.
That is why I joined this journey. No one else wanted to go.
I had to create an opportunity.
I always end up on the short end...why?
Pray for a hundred days to Buddha.
He will help you.
Does it really work?
Y should go to the children.
She is giving birth!
We need hot water...
What shall we do?
We don't even have drinking water.
What the hell you guys all doing here?
Get out, get out!
That son of bitch...
He is out of mind!
Dansaeng!
Call everyone over.
I'll go and get him.
What can we do?
Shit! Be careful!
There are thieves!
General, two men stole water from our well.
What about Dansaeng?
Where is he?
Uh?
He was right behind me!
Where is he?
Uh, over there!
Dansaeng!
Dansaeng get up!
Give me that.
Dochoong
Throw the fire.
- Dansaeng!
- Hurry!
- Hurry!
- Run!
Run!
- Almost...
- Climb up!
Get the rope!
Climb up!
Climb up!
Dansaeng!
Hurry up!
Wait!
What the hell he's doing? !
Dansaeng, come back!
Come on.
Hurry up!
Get this one first!
Hurry up!
Pretty clever... Do you want to try?
Dansaeng.
That's alright... Give me your hand.
No!
Dansaeng
Shit... Stop crying.
Let him cry.
How dare you come here, huh?
You want to kill us all?
Dochoong!
Give me back my eye!
Give it to me! You told us you would give us a boat, didn't you?
What good is the Princess of the Ming Empire when she can't even get us a small boat!
Your words brought us here.
where is the damned boat?
Why did you hit me?
Why?
Why the hell did you hit me?
Then, hit me!
Hit me more!
Don't blame the Princess,
Everything was my decision.
The general will take responsibility?
How can you take responsibility for a situation like this?
We just have to send the Princess out alone - why can't we do that!
Why? !
Why don't you just sent her out? !
That's enough...
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Someone has to tell the Princess about this!
Shut up!
Daejung!
Don't stop them... It's better them to say what's on their minds.
General, what are they talking about?
You are all cowards.
Then let's just cut the Princess's head off.
You keep out of this.
If we hang her head outside the fortress wall, they might turn back.
If you all wish, I'll do that.
Interpreter, what's Yeesol saying?
I order you to tell me!
That you should be sent to the enemy.
Shut your mouth!
You want me to tell her what he really said?
Do you understand how much your words hurt her?
I only came all the way here for her.
Never wish for something you can never get.
Don't forget you are a slave.
Have you ever heard of the slave, Manjuk?
He said, 'People are all the equal.'
Are Kings of different blood than any of us?
After saying those words, he was beheaded.
Whoever aims at my neck will have their arm cut off first.
My sword carries no mercy.
Do you want a match?
Too many have died already, too many...
Now you want us to kill each other?
That is the last time you interfere. I don't need your help any longer.
It's a boy!
Bless this child for luck and health.
What are you doing here?
Do you want him to freeze?
- She only cares for herself. - She doesn't deserve to hold the child...
Hurry and take the child inside, Before he catches cold.
Your highness...
Your highness...
Please forgive me.
Bring me a horse.
I am leaving this fortress.
Stop this, your highness. You are what we are fighting for.
Don't you see that everybody wants me to leave as soon as possible? As the Princess of the Great Ming Empire, I will end this war with my own hands.
Your highness, please don't go... Please.
Do you want me to take my own life right here?
No one may step forward.
I will go by myself.
General...
Get out of my way.
The Koreans won't give up, your highness.
Please trust me!
How dare you block me?
Let us wait... they are coming towards us.
You can't go.
Will you watch guard outside the fortress?
Kill him!
Wait.
Let him pick up his sword.
What happened to the others?
What about Yeesol?
Just stay where you are.
Daejung, Daejung
You can't move sir, not now.
Stay still.
The royal castle was too suffocating...
I thought that if I left there I would be free.
This is all my fault.
I'm so scared.
I don't think I can bear it any longer.
Neither can I. I'm nothing but a cowward.
I was always afraid that people would notice that.
I do not deserve being called General.
Everyone come here!
Is he dead?
Wait, he's moving...
I'm not sure how long he's got.
General, what is the meaning of this?
When they open the gate doors to rescue him, we'll rush them.
If they decide not to come for him, we keep their best warrior.
Is anyone going to save him?
- I'll go down to get him.
- General... if we open the door now we'll all die.
It's a trap.
So you're saying we stand back and do nothing?
That's the only way.
It is better for him to die quickly by our own hand.
Should I throw the torch?
The moonlight is bright enough.
Daejung...
Daejung
Don't shoot.
You like him too, don't you?
Daejung.
Do you still consider me General?
I want to lead the battle tomorrow.
Up till now, we have gone through so much.
It is a miracle that we've made it this far.
I remember an old Chinese proverb -
'If we attempt to live, we die, if we attempt to die, we live.'
Let us trust each other and unite. Even if we all die...
Tomorrow they will break through the gate and enter.
When they come in we will use these bombs.
Be careful.
Come here...
Everyone, stand up.
Tomorrow, we will protect you, your highness.
Do you wish to become a general in the Yuan Empire?
I am a free man...kill me.
They never took your existence seriously.
In order to rebuild the Yuan Empire, we need courageous warriors like you.
~ the morning mountain home, white bird sings a song ~
~ I want to hear the song, wish to go back home ~
~ I want to hear the song, wish to go back home ~
Sir, you resemble my father who had passed away.
The Koreans and the Hans look very much alike. We're like brothers.
We're like brothers.
This has gone on too long... everyone will die.
Before sunset comes we return to the prairie.
No, no, wait a minute.
Fire, fire, fire!
They're using fire first!
Don't move.
Everyone run for cover!
General... we've failed.
Daejung....
Let us have an honorable death.
That is my wish.
Jaosinwe!
Jaosinwe!
We must go out and fight together!
Dochoong!
Dochoong...
Protect the Princess Leave this fortress with her!
So many warriors have died because of you!
Yesol...
My son...
It's too dangerous
You cannot cross the sea with that boat.
I must go.
Only those who have a long journey will see the long roads to go home
He was always alone, always by himself.
Never anyone to share the game.
He lived in another world.
He was that kind of guy.
Come on, Spike. Get up.
Listen to me.
It's like a pot of stew bubbling on the stove.
All mixed up with no telling what's good or what's bad.
It's all the same.
But there's one thing you shouldn't forget. You know what it is?
Meat?
Everyone says that, but that's wrong.
Without the basic stock, you don't have a stew.
If you add curry powder, you get curry.
We have stock cubes in the pantry.
Not that, you idiot!
Great, a wannabe preacher with a gun.
Come on, Spike.
I'll go around the back.
All right.
No point waiting for the cops.
I know your security here.
-You know why?
-Renzi, hurry it up.
You see this logo?
That's your security company.
I used to work for your security company.
I got laid off, so I took up robbery.
Funny, ain't it?
Go on. Laugh.
Funny, is it?
It sure is.
Stop laughing!
We're closed.
Go someplace else.
Now, go ahead and fill up my money card.
Who the hell are you?
Are you deaf?
Damn it!
You!
Take those earphones off!
I'll take this.
Hey, Spike!
These crooks will pay for my doughnuts.
Don't move!
-Hey, Jet.
-What?
You said there were three.
Drop your guns!
To fool an enemy, first fool yourself.
What's the point?
-Listen up!
-You spend too long on the toilet!
You want the old lady to die?
You hear me?
You see the gun?
Sorry, Granny.
We ain't cops or security guards.
It ain't our job to save your life.
-What?
-Bad luck, ain't it?
That's Cowboy--
-What are you blabbing about?
-Don't shoot me!
Cowboy?
Who the hell are you?
Just a bounty hunter.
-It's your move.
-Don't rush me.
Do you plan your moves?
Just hurry up.
Listen, Spike. In shogi, Japanese chess you look 100 moves ahead, then make your play.
You head off your opponent's attack.
That's how you play.
You don't just move at random.
I want to move here.
Take your finger off, and you've moved.
You're far too easygoing.
Now, listen, Spike.
One's character merges in shogi.
-You obviously react to each move.
-Hurry up. Move.
What would you have done if you'd hit the hostage?
I'd have dealt with it.
It was too risky for a measly 1 .25 million bounty.
There's no drama in bounty hunting.
Before you became my partner, life was much quieter.
Good, I was considering that myself.
Well, Spike?
I found it! I found it!
Faye, a message for you.
Target heading for town, using Booth 8 on Route 12.
Get me an ID on him and the vehicle.
It's some kid.
I hate bounty-hunting boys.
That's not him.
Time for the CBC News.
Today's top story:
At 10 a.m. on Highway 7 a tanker truck exploded into flames.
Seventy-two persons are dead and 425 suffered injuries.
We have a live report from Lylie.
Reporting from the scene.
The wreckage is being removed and the area cleaned up.
People within a two-mile radius of the crash site were soon overcome by the noxious fumes.
A general panic ensued.
Three hours after the accident, calm has returned.
Is there a possibility the truck was carrying a poison?
The police suspect either a toxic chemical or a biological hazard.
The area has been sealed off.
Any leads on why it exploded?
No information at this point.
But police say the vehicle had been stolen earlier.
They suspect this could be a case of biological terrorism.
Live from the scene.
It's on every channel.
Déjà vu, huh?
It feels like I had instant noodles last night too.
Don't be so stupid.
You've had that for dinner for three days in a row.
Really?
I thought it was a dream.
We've got other instant food.
We have flat white and buckwheat noodles, all instant.
We've even got instant sushi, but it's over a year old.
-Try your luck.
-I partake!
Just carbohydrates aren't very good for you.
Man needs protein.
What are you going on about?
I said I like meat.
Forget the smalltime punks. We need a big bounty.
How did it go with you, Faye?
Terrible.
You want to hear?
Didn't you say your hacker was easy to trace?
I got caught up in that explosion.
I'll take one.
Plus, I lost big at the races.
Look. That's it!
Were you there?
Well, it was quite an accident.
Virus? I see.
Oh, no!
A chemical weapon?
I'm not contaminated!
Hey!
Even the dog's avoiding me!
Dirty, dirty, full of germs!
Cut that out!
The Mars government is offering a reward of 300 million Woolong.
Three hundred million?
What can it be?
-You too?
-Yes.
-Well?
-I've never seen symptoms like these.
They all show unnatural pressure on the brain but we have no idea what's causing it.
I haven't got a clue.
On admittance, they all showed reactions in the lymph corpuscles.
Their condition is worsening, but the lymphs are now normal.
Could it be smallpox or Ebola?
It's no virus that we know of and it's not a nerve gas.
What does that mean?
We can't find any traces not even in the dead bodies.
It must be some kind of an unknown virus or some form of a germ-warfare agent.
This could be dangerous.
Sorry.
It's my allergy.
I know by now we've cured most allergies but this could be viral.
Someone could be deliberately spreading it.
It's a no-smoking area.
What do they want?
Are you sure?
If not, we'll all end up dead.
It's starting now.
Bio-terrorists?
You'd better watch this, Spike.
-Why me?
-This information doesn't come cheap.
We know that.
Hurry it up.
-It's very valuable.
-Edo, start now.
Lee Samson, computer hacker.
A bounty of 5 million.
We traced his card with false ID on it.
-How?
-I hacked their database.
He used the card to rent a car that was blown up.
But Lee wasn't in it. Probably an accomplice.
Yes, that's the guy.
I don't get it.
You expect us to hunt him down with these flimsy leads?
But it's all inside my head.
Here you are.
You can draw on the monitor with it.
We don't even know if he's the terrorist.
He didn't have a mask on, so he'd be dead by now.
No, he didn't die.
-How do you know?
-Women's intuition.
Intuition?
Finished.
That's his face?
That's a hell of a face.
If you can find a face like that I'll pay the bounty.
All right. I'm wasting my time here!
I'll get him by myself.
Sounds like a waste of time to me.
I'll start on the virus.
What?
Now you're interested?
You can bank on a woman's intuition.
-But still-- -I'm sick of eating out of Styrofoam.
I used to fly every day.
We sure did.
I'd love to fly again, maybe as far as Saturn.
You liar!
The biggest thing you ever flew was a crop-duster.
-Is that right?
-Excuse me.
I have a question.
No point. We're all going deaf.
Where's the bean-seller?
There's a lot of them down there.
No, I want to buy the other "beans."
You're an undercover cop.
Do I look like a cop?
More like a gangster.
Same thing, really.
I'm a bounty hunter.
So you're the Cowboy?
We used to be cowboys too, in the old days.
Good. We can talk.
That's more reason not to.
Are you looking for beans?
You've got some, have you?
Of course. You can get anything at Moroccan Street.
That's why you came.
Is Pistachio around?
Calabar beans. They tell if your wife's cheating.
The innocent eat them all at once and vomit them out.
The guilty eat one at a time and the poison sets in.
That's how it works.
-I don't have a wife.
-You're a lucky man.
-What I want to know--
-Broad beans are bad.
Pythagoras died after eating them.
Don't underestimate the bean.
I want to know about the virus from that truck accident.
Do you believe in demons?
With so much in the world about us why does man's imagination go beyond that?
Why does man long for the skies and yearn for the universe?
Because in the old days, man used to fly.
Do they sell drugs?
If you can imagine it, it can happen.
Even if it cannot be seen.
So you have the virus?
That was no virus.
Hello, Rashid.
I've got a vase for you.
This was made for you.
No, he needs it more than me.
Yes, my friend, it was made for you.
Made for me?
You should always buy such things.
Look, I didn't come here for shopping.
-You made a good buy.
See you.
-Wait a minute!
-Inshallah.
-Hey, I said to wait.
Games from the 20th century are much better.
I'm sick of the games they make today.
I'm addicted to these old-school games.
Back then, they were happy with such games.
Same with hackers.
Back in the good old days of Cap'n Crunch.
Such a small thing, but now it's part of history.
Everything's so well-guarded now it's hard to become famous.
So I'm really impressed with what we did.
I've long wanted to do something.
A real terrorist attack.
Oh, no.
He's dead.
Your license.
Where are you going?
It's only warehouses down here.
Oh, no.
He's dead.
In those days, the sheriff could see his enemies.
So, what was in that tanker truck?
We haven't found a trace yet.
-What do you mean?
-What I said.
Something we can't see and we've never seen.
What's that?
A space truck was found near one of the asteroids.
The driver was dead and the cargo gone.
A truck hijack?
The truck belonged to Cherious Medical but they didn't report it missing.
Rumor has it that it was carrying some sort of contraband.
-Soon after, the terrorists struck.
-Smells fishy.
Cherious guards their secrets far too well.
Why don't you investigate them?
Get them on some trumped-up charges.
Things have changed since you were a cop.
The ISSP has no teeth these days.
We're powerless.
Our bosses only think about their promotions.
The rank and file are in cahoots with gangsters.
We're so rotten, we're falling apart.
Things haven't changed.
That's why I quit.
Ever hear of purgatory?
The place between heaven and hell.
It's where souls that didn't make it to heaven suffer eternally.
Right.
This world of ours.
Is this all there is?
There are 30,000 units in the capsule.
Once it's opened, they'll start to replicate.
Be careful with it.
Where's the money?
That's less than we agreed.
You'll get the rest after the party.
Then you can do as you please.
Then I can say goodbye to this pitiful life.
Can I ask you something?
Why does it have to be on Halloween?
In the old days, Halloween was the day when the souls in purgatory could, through prayer, reach heaven.
Start praying.
Hey, amigo!
Hello to the solar system's three million bounty hunters!
It's time for the Big Shot!
Giving you full details of current bounties.
Today's special show will run for an extra 20 minutes.
We'll focus on the extraordinary bounty of 300 million offered by the Mars government.
Yes, it's the largest bounty ever offered!
But no one knows who or where they are.
Are there no clues?
No, they left nothing at the scene and no living witnesses.
So how shall we do this?
Well, we're offering a special prize to anyone who calls in information.
Be the first to access the number on your screen.
Let's take a commercial break.
They're totally useless.
Hey, Faye.
Take a look at this.
It's just like before.
-Tattoos?
-I searched for a matching symbol.
Which one is it?
Well, it's not this one.
-This one?
-Is that a true lie?
This one.
No mistake.
Unit 7, Mars Special Forces attack team.
Special forces?
So they're military?
They were disbanded three years ago.
Any data on them?
Of course.
What?
Most of them are dead.
Next.
What's the matter, Ein?
No way!
Hurry up. Next.
Ein says he's the one.
How would a dog know?
Look, he died two years ago in the Titan Wars.
I've had enough.
Clean it up.
I really hate this kind of boring desk work.
I know that somewhere there's a perfect job for me.
Faye.
Why do I have to waste my youth alongside these jerks?
-Faye, Faye.
-Where did I go wrong?
Lee is using his card again.
They're connected!
-Is that a spittoon?
-Kind of.
-An octopus tank?
-Kind of.
What's this?
Ein says this guy is the one we're after, but Faye disagrees.
But unfortunately he's dead.
Vincent Volaju.
Any luck, Spike?
A vase?
They made me buy it.
How about you?
I love Western movies.
Give me a look at it!
I reckon we could sell Edo to a circus.
I saw my old pal Bob.
A drug company's up to something.
Drug company?
There's something in here.
What is it?
You're pretty good.
Here they come!
Are you alone?
Why don't we play together?
I much prefer the real thing to virtual reality.
The real thing?
At last I've found you, hacker boy.
I only needed 500 points!
Then Sporky Dorky appears.
Are you listening?
Damn it. That was my best score ever.
How will you repay me, bounty hunter babe?
Do you realize the trouble you're in?
It's "game over" for you, kid.
You owe me for Sporky Dorky.
What's going on?
Come back!
What the hell?
That is so weird.
What's inside there?
They're lymph corpuscles.
The things you find in human blood?
But this one is not normal.
What's different?
I don't get it at all.
This is a normal lymph corpuscle.
But this one is slightly different.
What's different?
I'll blow it up.
I still don't get it.
Let's heat it in the microwave.
It's really weird.
What the hell?
Hello? Is that Totas Cleaning?
Make your report.
The ISSP are treating it as a terrorist attack.
They're still investigating, but have no firm leads yet.
They're still analyzing it as if it were a virus.
We're safe for a while, but we mustn't waste time.
What about Mendelo, colonel?
We've had reports he's been seen on Moroccan Street.
I contacted my spies there, but he'd already left.
We have to make sure this doesn't go any further.
Life on Mars could end because of it.
But did Vincent actually activate the process?
It is pure evil personified in a test tube.
Its very existence is a threat to all life.
Vincent and Mendelo don't deserve to live.
-You understand?
-Yes, sir.
Have you seen my car?
Didn't you just drive it out?
Put your hands up.
I know you from somewhere.
I like your outfit too.
-Yours doesn't suit you.
-You think so?
Now turn around.
-What do you know?
-Wanna flip a coin?
If it's heads, I'll tell you.
You're pretty tough for a drug company office girl.
Knowing too much can shorten your life.
But tough girls are my type.
Halt or I'll shoot!
Happy Halloween. Trick or treat.
I'll make mischief unless you give me something sweet.
I'm so tiny that no one can find me.
So great, no one can see me.
But to the marrow, I'm part of you.
What's he trying to say?
I don't know, but as a statement, it's meaningless.
Has anyone seen a really disgusting hat here?
No time for that.
We've just had a terrorist statement.
Probably a hoax.
Perhaps, but yesterday's capsule makes it far too real.
That vase?
What we thought were lymph corpuscles are actually a mass of micro-robots.
A new type of nanomachines.
What's that?
-Heard of them?
-No.
What are they?
Micro-robots, invisible to the naked eye made from a form of protein.
You like your protein but no way you could eat these guys.
Originally used for medical purposes.
So why put them in the vase?
One clue is that lymph corpuscles are composed of bone marrow.
So what?
The one who made the statement knows that fact.
-So what?
-That's all.
What?
We still don't know what's going on.
What a waste of time.
How did it go at Cherious?
Security is far heavier than their business demands.
Their guards all carry G-21 submachine guns.
That's a military-issue weapon, isn't it?
Few civilians can get ahold of them.
I saw a woman with the same tattoo as Vincent.
And she was really....
-She was what?
-Quite beautiful.
If the military's involved, it's a whole new ball game.
It seems that the more we learn, the less we know.
Where are you going?
I'll go and sleep on it.
Everything comes to he who waits.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Has anyone seen that hat?
No, I haven't.
Where did it get to?
What a weird smell!
What is it, Ein?
Here?
Trick or treat!
Idiot!
Halloween's not till tomorrow!
It's not him, then.
Trick or treat!
You're welcome to trick me.
Treat, please.
How about if I trick you, son?
I'm not a boy.
I'm a girl!
I've got no time for women!
Not him either.
I've found him.
-Hello?
-I've found him!
-Is that you, Edo?
-I've found Lee.
Really?
That's great!
I knew you were special.
Where are you?
I'm sending my location now.
Watch him carefully.
I'll be right over. Don't move.
No problem.
Bye-bye.
Trick or treat, trick or treat.
Give me something good to eat.
Level one cleared.
That was too easy.
You're always playing that.
Is it fun?
What game is it?
She's just a stupid kid!
Which building is he in?
Which apartment?
It's quite a simple game.
The one who has the last ball remaining wins.
That's "game over." Did you win?
The real game starts now.
What do you mean?
Don't tell me that's a capsule? !
"It's just a game."
No way!
You're kidding, aren't you?
Only one can win.
I'll never get to see Sporky Dorky.
Hey, don't you go and die on me!
Press my restart button....
Emergency call from Alpha 1.
I've found Humpty Dumpty.
Current location is 2415, and he is mobile.
I'm on my way.
Don't move a muscle till I arrive.
What about bones?
Leaving Sector 17, moving to 18.
Heading for Central Station.
This way. I'll follow you.
You stay here.
Watch the car.
Vincent!
I knew you by your smell.
You stink of spilled blood.
A bounty hunter, huh?
Bad luck for you.
Blame those who put the bounty on your head.
-Why don't you shoot?
-What?
Or are you just putting on a tough-guy act?
Go ahead. Shoot.
No point.
You're worth nothing dead.
I'm not afraid to die.
Death is but perchance to dream.
To dream for all eternity.
You asshole.
Is that all you've got?
What's your name?
Spike Spiegel.
-I'll see you in another world.
-Vincent!
Vincent.... It's me, remember?
Why only me?
Vincent.
Can you hear me, Spike?
You're dying.
He's dead.
He was dead from the beginning.
Just like you.
He's the one who found the body floating in the river.
Thank you.
What did you see?
You were on the verge of death.
I was dreaming.
Well, which is the dream?
The first time ever first time I've been truly scared.
Shaking with fear.
If one single atom had given way I would have died.
It was not destined to be your time to die.
Swimming Bird these blue eyes see everything.
They see the past, the present and the future.
They look upon the full flow of time.
They see not the reality they see only the truth.
Open your eyes of truth.
There is nothing to fear.
Yes.
I understand.
So you're not dead?
What about Vincent?
He disappeared.
As if he was never there at all.
We've gotten mixed up in something fatal.
As my father always said:
"The ship that sets sail either keeps sailing or it sinks."
We're just bounty hunters.
This is far too big for the likes of us.
We can still quit now.
We should back off.
Okay, Spike?
He can sleep anywhere.
Why did you disobey orders?
You don't wish to answer?
Did you consider that disobeying orders was the direct cause of so many innocent deaths?
I'm very sorry.
You're restricted to barracks as of now.
I'll give my final decision at a later date.
-Watch her closely.
Our investigation shows the element used on the monorail is the same as that from the tanker truck.
Have you managed to identify that element?
We're doing it now.
The hacking of our computers was carried out by one Lee Samson with a similar m.o. in a previous attack.
We're running a trace on his path of access.
-Any chance he's their leader?
-Yes, there is.
We believe he has had contact with terrorist groups.
What is their aim?
Is it ideological, or do they want money?
We're still checking.
Is everything still "being checked"?
How long must we wait?
The medicals should be ready by now!
I feel so heavy.
-What's that?
-My legs feel heavy.
-Hey!
-I got it!
I hacked into Cherious Medical.
Check their trucking records for October 15.
-Back on the job, Spike?
-No way.
I'm just checking up.
Otherwise, I can't sleep.
You sleep too much.
Truck, truck, where have you been?
It carried a load of macadamia nuts.
Macadamia nuts?
I wouldn't try to eat them.
I'll check it out.
"Macadamia Nuts Control Department."
"Macadamia Nuts RD Department."
Why such attention to mere nuts?
Edo, take a look into the RD Department.
-Any clues to what they're doing?
My hacking program has crashed.
Now?
We were so close.
Edo, try another route and get a profile on him.
Dr. Mendelo al Hedia.
At SIT, he was researching nanomachines.
There's no way that's a drug company.
They're developing war nanomachines for the military.
So Vincent stole some of their nanomachines?
But war nanomachines were banned by the Treaty of Amsterdam.
If this is a military operation, they're doing it underground.
That means Vincent is still alive.
Hello, Steve.
What can I do for you, Electra?
What's that?
A blood sample?
Check it out for me.
Okay, if you agree to a date.
Well, okay.
I'll reserve a table for Halloween night.
What's going on?
Why am I still alive?
What did you do to me?
I gave you my blood.
Now you won't die when I unleash the power.
Just like me.
It won't be much longer now.
Did you find what you wanted?
No, just a lot of things I don't need.
That's how the world turns.
There are people who make things we'll never want.
Who's making these demons?
Why did you give me that vase?
It was perfect for you.
I mean what was inside.
Nanomachines in the form of lymph corpuscles.
Dr. Mendelo's.
A man escaped here over three years ago.
He said he had made a hideous development one that's programmed to spread through touch or through the atmosphere.
In the blood, it assumes the form of lymph corpuscles and endlessly replicates until it reaches the brain and destroys it.
Then it turns to protein and exits the body leaving no trace at all.
That's as much as I know.
There's only one thing I want to know:
How come Vincent's still alive?
What are you trying to do?
Are you doing this for money? For revenge?
Or is it just a game to you?
I am only trying to find the door.
The door?
Have you ever had a dream where you're aware that you are in the middle of a dream but can't wake up?
That's when it started.
From when I was still on Titan.
Vincent was a guinea pig.
He injected an anti-nanomachine into Vincent's blood.
Anti-nanomachine?
It replicates like nanomachines.
It destroys nanomachines.
It was a vaccine experiment.
Vincent started it.
Only he can stop it.
But we don't know his motive.
Maybe he doesn't have one.
Perhaps Vincent is just waiting for Judgment Day.
Doesn't Dr. Mendelo have everything?
Nanomachines, the vaccine?
He disappeared and deleted all the data from his computer.
He never imagined anyone could use his discovery.
He disappeared without a trace.
No one can stop Vincent.
I lost two things on Titan.
One was my past.
There were no opposing armies in that battle.
They were all killed to test the nanomachines as weapons.
I was used as a guinea pig....
The only one who survived.
I lost all memories of my early life.
I didn't even know who I was.
What was the other?
Did you see the butterflies?
I saw countless butterflies.
So many, so very beautiful.
When the nanomachines reach the brain, a light is seen.
It's as if.... The most beautiful sight in the world.
I've talked too long.
Rashid, please give this to the doctor.
Should you happen to meet him.
Yes, I will.
Okay, then. Inshallah!
What's this all about?
We're the ones who'd like an explanation.
Why does your blood have the anti-nanomachines?
How did this escape our attention?
We thought only Vincent had it. How did you get it?
Have you contacted him?
We'll place you in protective custody.
If I have the vaccine in my body can't we use it to protect the population?
You just don't get it.
Our sole purpose is to completely destroy all record of the nanomachines.
With no records, they never existed.
Hi.
What is the bond that ties us all together?
It's not as if we're family.
There's no linking bond like that.
We each go our own way and do as we please.
They give me so much trouble.
I've had enough.
I want to be alone again.
One more move and I win.
Hey, leave them alone!
But does it matter?
So what if they don't come back?
The toss of a coin.
If it had come up tails, I would've asked you on a date.
Nothing special, mind you.
-Aren't you scared?
-Scared?
They'll either kill us or wipe out our memories.
We'll lose our identities anyway.
We'll be like the living dead.
Like Vincent?
The reason you survived the attack is because you have them in you.
That- - What is it?
Nanomachine vaccine?
-You know everything.
-It's like you said.
Knowing too much can shorten my life.
You're no ordinary bounty hunter, Spike Spiegel.
You're too good to be just a soldier.
My name is Electra Ovilo.
So now I know.
It's a strong name.
I didn't know I had them inside my body.
Vincent was....
Poor Vincent was all alone from birth.
All he had as a boy was hate and the will to fight.
No one has ever loved him.
That's why I wanted to help him.
I thought I could, but I was very wrong.
Back there, on the monorail he looked at me as if he didn't know me.
He had forgotten all about me.
Did you love him?
I don't know.
Have you ever experienced a brand-new feeling that welled up inside your heart and filled you with indescribable pain?
Yes, I have.
Maybe I was looking to be saved.
Years ago, back when I was much younger I was afraid of nothing. I had not the slightest fear of death.
I was ready to die anytime.
But then I met a special woman.
She made me want to go on living.
For the first time, I was afraid of death.
A feeling I'd never had before.
Where is she now?
She went away.
You're the first person I can talk to like this.
What's between you and Vincent?
We share similar souls.
That's why I must find him.
He said his name was Spike, didn't he?
So he's a friend of yours?
How do you know?
What do you plan to do?
I came here to finish it.
The final party begins.
My next trick is special nanomachines.
These will not self-destruct. They will multiply until....
You plan to destroy the world?
You- - You're insane.
You think so?
Who decides where to draw the line of insanity?
Aren't there those who cross and recross the line?
Soon you will understand.
It's not me.
The rest of the world is insane.
Will you join me?
We'll be the only ones left alive.
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't know what will happen, but I don't want that.
Do it by yourself.
-Vincent!
-I said never to come here.
Everything is ready to go.
I want to get away.
The cops are closing in.
-Pay me what you owe me.
-Have you prayed?
I'll be at the bridge connecting this world to heaven.
You can watch it all alone from purgatory.
What will happen to me?
You're a soldier. You're prepared for it.
Do I get a cigarette?
One will do.
-Shall I, sir?
-Ignore him.
No, don't shoot!
Throw down the gun.
Open the door.
I'll have these.
Where are they?
At the waterworks.
I tracked Lee's hack route to the waterworks.
So he plans to put it into the city's water supply.
-The antiterrorist squad!
-That'll fix him!
-Don't we need permission?
If we don't, there'll be serious trouble.
This is a no-smoking area.
If we go through channels, we'll run out of time!
We've got a job to do.
Where's your blood sample?
This way.
It's open.
-Protective suits?
-No time!
They're behind us!
Where's Electra's vaccine?
It's being cultured in number three-- No, case number two.
-Is this it?
-The yellow packs.
I'm not lying, but it's not finished yet.
In 20 hours, each pack will have 100,000 units.
I'm sorry, Electra.
You can get out through Level 3.
Thanks.
So no date, I guess.
-Who are you?
-ISSP.
We're taking over here.
I've had no such orders!
We ask your cooperation.
I can't let anyone see me like this.
Rest in peace.
Waiting for a call?
No, not particularly.
Aren't you waiting for Spike to call?
What?
I didn't notice them leave.
-Hello?
-Vincent has gone.
Where the hell have you been?
He's planning a very nasty Halloween party.
How do you know that?
Spike!
You idiot!
Where the hell were you?
-ISSP are headed for the waterworks.
-City waterworks?
Gate 2 all clear, sir.
Tank 3 shows no abnormalities, sir.
A suspicious object near the gate to Plant 4.
Bomb squad on the way.
Object appears to be a pumpkin-shaped balloon.
That's strange.
Why is he dressed like a warlock?
There's a Halloween costume parade in Alva City.
So he wants to blend in?
He'll do it in the middle of town?
But how?
His accomplice said Jack was in place.
Jack?
Yes, I see.
Jack-o'-lantern?
Yes, a Halloween lamp.
We're starting now.
What's that?
Unit A, report!
Damn it!
Find out what's going on.
-Sir!
-What is it?
It's the army, sir.
-Damn!
-Sir!
Who's in charge?
Who ordered the army to take over?
That's classified.
We're in charge now.
What gives you the right?
-National emergency.
-A what?
Test results are in.
Hurry up. Tell me.
I told you to leave!
It's composed of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide with traces of argon, neon and krypton.
It's air, sir.
But the town will be full of jack-o'-lanterns.
He said he'd be at the bridge joining here to heaven.
What's that mean?
Jet, we need 20 to 30 aircraft as soon as possible.
What are you planning to do?
I'll take Swordfish.
Wait a minute!
Faye, go to the weather control center.
Hey, not so fast.
You can't beat Vincent.
He's indestructible.
-We have unfinished business.
-It's a waste of time!
If he wanted to destroy the world, he'd have done it.
This invitation says the party won't start without the guest.
If you don't go, the party won't start.
Go for it!
Only death cures stupidity!
The army.
What a nuisance!
I've got no time to play with you!
It's an emergency. We need help!
But we have rules.
All our fighter jets are at the airshow celebration.
There's no time.
Anything that can fly will do!
You said anything?
It's too early to start the party.
They made good planes back in those days.
Can they actually fly?
We'll have no trouble spraying the vaccine for you.
Don't overdo it, old fella.
Where are we headed?
Saturn?
No, we're going to vaccinate the city to save it.
We're only going as far as Alva City.
I was just kidding!
They really can fly!
They're all museum pieces. Haven't been flown for decades.
Don't give up now!
Hey, taxi!
Who's in charge?
Who are you?
As you can see, I'm just a terrorist.
-What do you want here?
-Your demands?
I want it to rain.
Rain? What for?
Well, how about rain on the parade?
This is hopeless.
The parade is tying up traffic everywhere.
The bridge to heaven?
You forgot to pay!
Has the party begun?
It's just starting.
Reminds me of the sinking of the Bismarck.
You old liar. That was back in WWII.
We're almost there.
Get ready.
I knew you'd come, bounty hunter.
The last time we met, I managed to survive.
Your eyes are more than empty holes.
Come to save the world, have you?
You're too late for that.
Sorry. I'm just a bounty hunter.
It ain't none of my business.
I'm only here to get revenge on you.
You think this is just a threat?
I will do it.
Go ahead.
Before you die, tell me one thing.
I died up there on Titan.
Is this world the one the butterflies showed me in the dream?
Or is that world the actual reality and my world just a dream?
I don't understand.
Vincent!
You won't get away this time.
No.
Stay back, Electra.
Shall we go together?
Vincent!
Why didn't you shoot?
I remembered.... She was the one I loved.
I wanted to escape from here.
I searched for the door out of this world.
But now I understand. There is no door.
You should've known.
You were frightened to open your eyes and see.
Electra.... The time I spent together with you was my only reality.
I'm so glad we could meet again at the end.
What did the rain do?
It spread the vaccine much faster than the nanomachines could act.
Do you think there'll be a rainbow?
Jet? Want to go to the races?
You never learn, do you?
He was always alone, always by himself.
Never anyone to share the game.
He lived in another world.
He was that kind of guy.
"Two hundred years of american technology has unwittingly created a "massive cement playgound of unlimited potential.
But it was the minds of 11 "years olds that could see that potential."
- Hear me out with my question first. - Okay.
- That question sucked. - Yeah, man!
I'm trying to explain this to you, but you're not getting what I'm telling you.
- I don't like that question. - That was good.
We weren't looking at this as some kind of future.
There was no promise in it. There was no nothing in it.
People were really living in the moment. There were no goals.
There were no aspirations.
It started here, in this area.
That's where it all started.
You know? That was the beginning of the revolution.
We were all punk kids, man. We were tough kids.
And we wanted to be something.
It turned into, like, a rock star thing, you know?
We were treated like kings at places that we went to.
I was on summer vacation for about 20 years.
It was cool to be in the magazines and stuff, but, you know, the bottom line was all we wanted to do was skate.
Craig understood that, like, children took the ruins of the 20th century and made art out of it.
I was, like, 12 years old and I'm reading these articles, and you don't know where your place is in the world yet.
And you read these words and the things that he had to say and the way he said them and the photographs that accompanied them and it was like,
"Wow, I'm really a part of something incredible, something important."
In 1975, the second issue of the recently reincarnated
SkateBoarder magazine would feature "Aspects of the Downhill Slide,"
the first of what would become known throughout the skateboarding world as the "Dogtown" articles.
These feature articles chronicled the adventures and exploits of Dogtown's Z-Boys.
They were the badasses. I mean, they were the freaks of the sport.
There was a scary thing about it, like, "These guys will kick your ass."
They didn't seem like they were a part of the rest of skateboarding.
It seemed like they had their own thing going on.
The Dogtown articles were the brainchild of 26-year-old artist and photojournalist Craig Stecyk.
Using a handful of pseudonyms, Stecyk would conceive, write, photograph and design the aesthetic that would come to define the Dogtown movement.
When we saw you guys in the magazines, it was, like,
"This is full-on.
They're living this."
No one skateboarded, no one rode a board, no one was as aggressive or as radical as they ever were.
The Zephyr team had guys with all different styles, and, really, it sparked a revolution.
I think the Zephyr team was straight-out the most influential skateboard team ever, ever to be assembled.
The Zephyr Skateboard Team was comprised of 12 individuals from an area in West Los Angeles known as Dogtown.
They were Shogo Kubo, Bob Biniak,
Nathan Pratt, Stacy Peralta,
Jim Muir, Allen Sarlo,
Chris Cahill, Tony Alva,
Paul Constantineau, Jay Adams, Peggy Oki and Wentzle Ruml.
There is a place where America's manifest destiny collides into the Pacific Ocean.
A place where the fabled Route 66, the roadway of American dreams, terminates.
This is Dogtown.
There's an invisible line of demarcation from the north side of Santa Monica to the south side of Santa Monica.
You're looking at one side of town that had trophy houses and lots of money. And you're looking at the south side that wasn't like that geographically.
It was actually a visible financial line, where, if you lived above Wilshire, you had money, and, if you lived below Wilshire, you wanted their money.
Dogtown was a territory encompassing the three beach communities of South Santa Monica, Venice and Ocean Park.
This was the last great seaside slum.
This was not the beach that people came to vacation at.
It was Dogtown, and Dogtown was a place where you had to have eyes in the back of your head.
It was dirty. It was filthy.
It was paradise.
Dogtown was a faded blip on the radar screen of popular surfing, a rundown coastal resort inhabited by surfers infamous for their aggressive localism and outcast behavior.
Surfing in 1972 or 1971 was outcast, period.
Surfing was antisocial, generally speaking, in the world of things.
It wasn't the thing you did to build your self-esteem in society.
It was like... If you were a surfer, it was like saying you were a dropout.
It was not necessarily like it is today, where you've got Kelly Slater making millions of dollars.
In 1972, 23-year-old surfboard shaper Jeff Ho, 24-year-old surfboard builder Skip Engblom and 21-year-old artist Craig Stecyk joined together to form Jeff Ho and Zephyr Surfboard Productions.
In reaction to what they felt to be the mundane world of commercial surfing, the three scraped together what little cash they had and set up shop on the corner of Bay and Main Streets in the heart of Dogtown.
They were dedicated to being anti-mainstream, and they were proud to be anti-mainstream.
I think that we probably started it because there was nobody else building surfboards of a certain type that we kind of envisioned could be built.
They were a specialist surf shop.
If you wanted the most high-performance surfboard, this was the shop to come to.
It wasn't like you were going into a standard surf shop by any stretch of the imagination.
There was other surf shops, but they didn't have the "bad boy" image as it came out of the whole P.O.P. culture.
They created a whole new identity, a totally separate, unique identity in terms of the kind of surfboards that they made, the color of the boards, the way they were shaped, what Jeff Ho was doing was kind of revolutionary at the time.
He was exploring all kinds of design concepts.
Jeff Ho was the most intense person I've ever worked for in any business environment my whole life.
Jeff was a madman.
I mean, Jeff would lose it.
He'd lose his temper.
He could just erupt on a moment's notice and put you through just the ultimate Chinese water torture on any little thing.
Jeff Ho was recognized throughout the coastal region as an eccentric surfboard shaper who pushed the boundaries of conventional surfboard design.
The boards that were coming out of the Jeff Ho Shop were a different design.
Constantly, Jeff would shape something, develop it, try it, and then go on to the next level.
I mean, he was, like, a guy that was like Howard Hughes. I mean, he'd make something and actually fly it.
He was making it, and he was surfing it.
So, he was exploring it as an engineer and a designer, and also actually riding it.
We just wanted to create something that was different than the other boards.
I was trying to develop something that was new, unique and different.
Inspired by the wall art tradition of local gangs and the vivid colors of the area's vibrant car culture,
Craig Stecyk airbrushed the Zephyr surfboards with a look reminiscent of Dogtown's culturally mixed neighborhoods.
It was to personalize stuff for the user, to make something that wasn't a mass-media, garbage, piece of junk that had been designed in some factory for everybody else.
Because we came from a little bit different environment.
It was graffiti art. It was full-blown, you know, urban graffiti art on surfboards.
It was very much an identification of an environment, like where we live.
Our history is based on lowriders and hot rods and Latinas.
Like, I'd fantasize about chicks with huge hair and lowriders.
You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, little blond girls named Buffy just weren't my scene.
So, therefore, that wasn't what we were at.
The average surf look at the time, the aesthetic of surfing, was very clean, very powder blue, very beige, you know, rainbows and sunsets and sandy beaches kind of a look.
What we were doing was "the debris meets the sea."
Using the shop as their front, Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom formed the Zephyr surf team, a group made up of the best surfers in the Dogtown area.
We were in the midst of rebar and concrete, airbrush saying, "Go home."
It was a statement saying, "Nothing's gonna stop us,
"and we're gonna do whatever the heck we want.
"And screw you if you don't like it. We don't care."
And that was the attitude, and that was the attitude in the water,
"We're here and look at us. If you don't like it, split."
We weren't really surfers in a traditional sense.
You know, we're from Venice.
One mile south of the Zephyr shop, lying directly on the border of Venice and Santa Monica, was Dogtown's epicenter, the Pacific Ocean Park pier.
Around the turn of the century, visionary land developer Abbot Kinney set out to create a European-like community, geared towards art, culture and amusement.
Kinney's dream would become Venice, California, replete with canals, gondolas, and a full-scale replica of the colonnaded square of its Italian inspiration.
The coastal zone that ran from Venice through Ocean Park and Santa Monica became the home to so many amusement park piers that it earned the reputation as the Coney Island of the West.
Eventually, only Pacific Ocean Park, known to the locals as P.O.P., an amusement park atop the old Lick Pier, remained.
They had this park with all this celebration of humanity and people having a good time, and they're free, and they're out in the ocean and, you know, the ocean breeze.
And then, all of a sudden, it turns into the worst nightmare you've ever imagined.
The party ended in the mid-'60s.
The beachfront expanse running from Venice through Santa Monica had become run-down and seedy.
Attendance at the once-magnificent Pacific Ocean Park plummeted, and in 1967 it closed, and soon thereafter became a no man's land.
A place where pyromaniacs, junkies, artists and surfers could excel in symbiotic disharmony.
It was kind of like the circus had left town.
It was a little scary for some people.
It was like this dead Wonderland.
I mean, you know, you've got this carcass of all these rides that are rusted and falling apart.
And it's like, you can hear the voices and the ghosts of the people that were having so much fun there, and kids like me that were making out in the sky balls that were going across at 13, you know.
It's like everything that was wonderful and fantastic suddenly has gone to death in this decrepit way.
And everybody had to live with that every day.
Burrowed deep within the derelict pier and shielded from view was the cove, a secret surfing spot wedged between a jail cell of broken and decayed pilings.
This was the most dangerous place I surfed in California. There's no question.
You're taking off basically in front of piers.
You're riding through piers.
There's wood floating around. There's debris.
You could get impaled on, like, a fallen roller coaster track or, like, a piling.
You knew if you made a mistake that you were gonna pay in flesh.
I mean, you could easily hit your head underwater, go unconscious and drown.
There was one piling in the beginning that had fallen, called the angle piling, which you could go through it.
That was a tricky thing to do.
It was one takeoff spot, and you had to be an aggressive,
"This is my wave. I'm going. Don't cut me off,"
because, if you did get cut off, you were in the pilings, you broke your surfboard in half.
I'd never seen that many surfboards break in my life.
Adorning the ruins surrounding the cove were spray-painted signs, warning intruders to keep out.
POSITIVELY NO VISITORS
You didn't go near that place if you didn't live there or know the people, because you were gonna get hurt.
That was an extremely heavy local spot.
There was a lot of fights. You know, people would just physically stop you and say, "You can't surf here."
It wasn't that we didn't want other people to surf the place, but just that other people would come in and do stupid things to jeopardize your life.
There's limited resources here, man.
There's 10 waves every 15 minutes, and there ain't enough for you, pal.
You had to earn your rights of passage on the land by your actions on the land and in the water.
You had to go up on the pier with a wrist rocket, hang out and shoot Vals that came out there, you know.
We would just fly things at people that we didn't know.
They saw guys that came to the pier that weren't from the area, they threw down pieces of concrete on them.
We'd start firing tiles at them.
All kinds of shit, you know?
People'd throw glass, rocks, whatever you could get your hands on.
It was really kind of neat because the water all around was, like, exploding, as shit was flying at them.
If they didn't want anybody else surfing there, nobody was going to surf there. That's all there was to it.
Best thing I ever saw was someone paddle out in the water with the guy's carburetor on top of his surfboard.
And goes, "Hey, does this belong to you?" And dropped it in the water.
You weren't just gonna drive up, pull your car up and go, "Wow, what a nice left. Look, the T's breaking.
Let's go out."
You had to earn your way into that, man.
Working their way up through the rubble and rebar of P.O.P. was Dogtown's next generation, a group of aggressive young surfers who were all eager to make their mark in hopes of becoming part of the Zephyr team.
It's almost like a Mafia, you know?
You get good enough surfing in the water, and, all of a sudden, you're a made man now.
And once you got on the Zephyr team, you had entrée. You're part of their group.
The Zephyr Team
Getting sponsored by the Zephyr team as a kid was nirvana.
It was, like, "Yeah, man!
"They like my moves. They like my... I'm doing it.
I'm doing it." If you were wearing the navy blue Zephyr shirt, you were the shit in the neighborhood.
When we were out here, it was reflecting more the hardcore urban side of the fence.
You know, the Zephyr crew was more street kids.
Most of us came from broken homes, living with our mothers.
Jeff and Skip were like the parent symbol in the equation.
Skip and Jeff really nurtured the kind of discarded kids that wouldn't have had a place to go.
The shop provided identity.
It was more like a place where you can go and hang out and be in the Bay Street environment.
It was much more like a clubhouse.
Everybody, like, had a little job.
You had to either fix dings or sweep the floor or, you know, roll joints for Jeff in the back.
You also knew that behind that door, there was stuff going on that no one talked about.
It was lowbrow and wild and "screw you."
I think there was a lot of family dysfunctionalism going on, and I think some of that came out aggressively in their surfing and in their skating.
The Zephyr team, in a weird way, because of the financial insecurity of the area, people looked at this and went, "Man, I got to make it now."
We were all hungry for recognition. So we all put out maximum effort. We all...
That's all we did.
It was a performance-based environment.
It was a very, very demanding group of people because they knew what performance was.
If you didn't come out and really perform,
I remember Jeff just, like, leaving.
We worked. We... worked.
You know, creating new moves, new this, new that.
Everybody brought something to the team.
Everybody did something different.
Everybody had a different style.
And that's what the whole thing was all about.
The aggressive performance ethic infused into these young skaters by Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom would eventually result in the undoing of the entire Zephyr organization.
A BRIEF HISTORY
In the late '50s, skateboarding became the popular after-surfing activity of the Malibu beach crowd.
Early on, skateboards took their shape in the form of small surfboards, and the maneuvers performed on the boards were strictly surfing-inspired.
Then, beginning in 1963, skateboarding began to emerge as an alternative sport for American teenagers.
California manufacturers, such as Makaha, Hobie and Jack's, began forming teams as skateboard competitions began springing up.
Many of skateboarding's early champions, skateboarders such as Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson,
John Fries, Woody Woodward, Bruce Logan, and the Hilton brothers, Davie and Stevie, were among the first to give the sport a stylistic aesthetic.
For a brief, fleeting period, skateboarding gained national popularity, but this popularity would be short-lived.
Few Youths Entering Skateboard Contests
Skateboarding crashed in 1965.
Virtually overnight, the young sport disappeared.
Back then, if you skateboarded, the first thing that came out of someone's mouth is,
"Isn't that just like the Yo-Yo?
Isn't that the same thing as a Hula Hoop?"
By the early '70s, skateboarding was viewed as just another passing kiddie fad, and only the most hardcore enthusiasts practiced it as it became nearly impossible to purchase a commercial skateboard.
If you wanted a skateboard back then, you had to go to the thrift store, buy a pair of roller skates with clay wheels, cut them in half...
Then, go out in your garage and try and find an old drawer out of a dresser that was a nice, half-inch or three-quarter-inch oak, if you were lucky.
Or go down to the hardware store, and we'd buy, like, a solid piece of oak or maple or whatever.
Borrow a Skilsaw or band saw...
Make it like a surfboard shape, you know?
And whip it out.
We used to go to Sears, like the sporting goods section of Sears, and we'd go in with tools with just our deck that we made custom, and we'd put all the new parts from the stock boards on the shelf.
- Right. - One guy would be watching. Two guys would be just taking all the parts.
And then we'd just cruise out of there.
Boards were equipped with clay wheels, the pinnacle of Stone Age technology.
You had to worry about hitting rocks, sliding out.
Any crack in the sidewalk is a hazard to your health.
Or a pebble... You hit a pebble, and the wheel would instantly lock up.
Your board would come to a screeching halt and you'd fly and you'd smash cement.
In 1972, East Coast surfer Frank Nasworthy came upon a great notion, that the petroleum-based product urethane might make a good substitute for clay.
So, he created Cadillac Wheels, which would pave the way for the coming skateboard revolution.
These urethane wheels would just... It was almost like a 4-wheel drive now, where the car would just grab the ground.
And you could really, really make hard turns.
It was the whole beginning of what skateboarding is today, period.
We were just getting into surfing then, and you could only surf in the morning around here because it blows out, the wind blows out the waves around 10:00.
So, you have the rest of the day to do something, so we skateboarded.
We used to skateboard at this place called Bicknell Hill.
I mean, it ran right down the street from the Zephyr surf shop.
We started skating outside the shop at first, 'cause we were all surf rats and we were hanging around the shop, and then they decided to put this team together and we all started skating on Bicknell Hill there.
And we were trying to get real low and, you know, we would, like, be looking at the surf and riding this hill and dropping in and sliding and doing cutbacks, like we were riding a wave.
We'd work on our Berts, and then we'd set up cones and do our slaloms.
And, you know, it was really fun practicing on Bicknell together.
Surfing had everything to do with everything, and skating just kind of went along after, when the waves weren't good.
That's when you skated.
Surfing was it, and skateboarding was just an extension of our surfing.
I remember being in the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, watching Hal Jepsen's surf film, Super Session.
And a young Hawaiian surfer named Larry Bertlemann came on the...
Larry Bertlemann was the fundamental impact on the Z-Boys thing.
The Z-Boys thing was, "Larry Bertlemann on concrete."
That's what we were all trying to do, because Larry Bertlemann just blew doors on everybody.
He, like, put his hands on the wave.
He was one of the first guys that I remember doing that.
So we started copying that on the ground.
Larry Bertlemann exploded the status quo of surfing upright and redefined the idea of what could be done on a surfboard.
When I saw Larry Bertlemann in a movie do a cutback, I wanted to copy that more than anything in life itself on a skateboard.
If I couldn't do it in the water, I'll do it on a skateboard.
We were surfers, first and foremost.
And the low, pivotal style in surfing is really functional. It also has a beautiful aesthetic.
We used to call them, "Do a 'Bert."'
And we'd do that on the banks. Even on the flat ground, we'd do it.
Five miles northeast of the Zephyr shop, located in the elite neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, was Paul Revere Junior High School.
Three miles east of Paul Revere Junior High was Kenter Canyon Elementary School.
Four miles east of Kenter was Bellagio Elementary School.
Three miles south of Bellagio was Brentwood Elementary.
And four miles further south of Brentwood was Mar Vista Elementary.
These five schools were built at the base of steep hillsides or burrowed within deep canyons, with walls of banked asphalt constructed to level out the sprawling playgrounds.
I think skaters were significant because they actually took those environments and they reworked them and made them into something different, that was more human, I think, than what the architects originally had planned.
That was where it started for us.
That was like our original skate park.
We would just ride bikes there, with our skates on our handlebars. Skate all day and break our boards, and then ride back, fix our boards and come back the next day.
These perfectly-tapered waves of black asphalt would allow for the virtual transmission of surfing-born maneuvers to concrete.
We were surfing these asphalt waves. That's what we were doing with the skating.
So we had a surf-skate style because we had the waves to ride it on.
We were, like, riding really hard and low and really doing a lot of sliding, and, like, thrusting kind of moves.
We were always touching the pavement.
It was all about feeling what you're doing.
Feeling your wheels grinding and pivoting around your hands.
I just wanted to ride more banks, go faster, do better turns.
We were totally emulating all of these surfers that we idolized, on skateboards.
Instilled within all the Dogtown skaters was a devotion to style.
Going big worked only as long as you looked good doing it.
You could get all the maneuvers, but having great style was what you were really shooting for.
Style was, like, the most important thing.
Style was everything.
I think that was one thing that really bound us all together, too, was that we all possessed a surf style.
There was no one in our group that wasn't fluent.
Individual style was who you are as an individual.
Whatever flair that you were throwing in, that's just an extension of you as your personality.
And everybody's personality is different, so everybody's style was different.
There were surfers with good style, and there were surfers that we would call "cockroach style," or no style, you know.
And if you had a bad style, right there you had one mark against you.
'Cause you had to look at it. You had to watch someone.
If they were skating with a funky style, they were stinking up the area.
You know? So, after a while, "Hey, you can't watch that guy. "He smells." You know?
I mean, the blues are three chords, but every guy that plays the blues plays the blues differently, because that's their own style, right?
We weren't making money off of it, we didn't think there was any future in it, and we were doing it because we loved doing it.
THE BIRTH OF VERTICAL
"Skaters by their very nature are urban guerillas: they make everyday use of the useless artifacts of the technological burden, and employ the handiwork of the government/corporate structure in a thousand ways that the original architects could never dream of."
In the '70s, California experienced the worst drought on record, and the city government wouldn't allow you to water your lawn.
You weren't even allowed to serve water at a restaurant.
And so, what happened is, all these swimming pools, which are abundant in Southern California, were drying up.
California's drought served as a midwife to the skateboard revolution, as hundreds of pools across the Los Angeles basin were left empty and unused.
Once pool riding came in, you know, that's like all that we wanted to do.
We were, like, the first people that were riding these empty swimming pools, and we had no idea what you could do.
I remember the first goal, the first day, was to make it over the light.
That was the first accomplishment in the pool, was to "over the light" successfully.
From there, we started doing double carves and hitting tile on both sides.
Our goal was to get to the lip and to actually hit the lip of the pool, so...
It was, like, completely foreign, mentally and physically.
But the fact that we were surfers, we knew which movements needed to be done. We just didn't know if they were possible yet.
Then it got to the point where we were getting on one wheel. All the other three wheels are out of the pool.
That one wheel's on the coping above the tile and flying back in.
We were definitely the first guys, I mean, the whole Dogtown crew to really take it to the top, to the lip, and actually grind and pivot on the lip.
You have to understand that, what they were doing on skateboards, it just had never been done anywhere else before.
There was just no such thing.
In a covert convergence, skaters would come from miles around to savor the fleeting, illicit thrills of skateboarding inside a recently-discovered backyard pool.
Once we found a couple of good spots, we knew that there was more of them available, and we just kept scouring the neighborhood.
We did extensive searching, looking for backyard pools.
We would drive up and down the alleys in the Valley, standing on the roofs of the cars.
Jay got on the top of my car, and we're driving down alley after alley in Beverly Hills, and Jay is on the top of my car, going,
Wait!" You know. We'd go up and down the alleys on our bicycles and jump up and look over the fences.
We'd go up and down canyons, and take vantage points, and we had binoculars.
We went to places where the pool was completely filled in with dirt.
We dug out an entire swimming pool so that we could skate it.
We would find some that were full of water, but they had to be emptied one way or another.
I mean, they just had to... The water had to go and they had to be ridden, man, you know what I mean?
At one point, we were so guerilla about it, we had electric pool pumps, gasoline-operated pool pumps, hundreds of yards of drainage hose, brooms, everything you needed.
There was plenty of times we found pools and we'd throw the pump in there, throw a wire over a wall, find a live socket.
Didn't know the house, didn't know any of the neighbors, any of the people.
Water would be running out...
And we'd drain a 30,000-gallon swimming pool in less than four hours.
Any house that was up for sale, that had a pool, nine times out of ten it was drained, or maybe it had two feet of water in it.
We'd drain the rest out, and we'd skate until the cops came, and then we'd split.
The tension was really high.
And you had to do what you had to do here and now.
It didn't come later.
When you have an empty swimming pool that you know might only be open for a day, or a day and a half, and that's it, you've got to skate it for as long as you can.
You had to almost, like, time yourself to be in there, trying to get there early in the morning, trying to get a few runs, and get out of there before the cops came, you know?
It was totally just illegal barging sessions.
And as soon as we heard either sirens, screeching tires, someone would yell the magic words, "Bail!" and we were out of there.
You could definitely get arrested. I mean, you could probably get charged a lot of money, because, let's face it, the pools weren't the same after we got done with them.
My dad would have killed me, bro. He would have killed me if he had to pay that kind of money.
Part of it was the thrill of knowing that the police could come anytime.
We got caught skating in the Canyon Pool, and I was hiding up in the tree looking down, and there was cops below me looking for us.
And I was afraid I was gonna drop my skateboard and nail them in the head.
And then I thought, "God, I'm gonna be arrested for," you know, "assault and battery."
If we got caught at a location, we'd go back the next day, and we would figure out how to not get caught that way.
So, if they came in the front, we'd post a lookout in the front.
If they came in through the back, we'd post a lookout in the front and back. We'd go through the side yard, you know?
You got to understand, man, this is concrete warfare we're talking about.
This is... You know, you might find a pool, and it's here today, maybe gone tomorrow.
If you're gonna ride it, you'd better get on that shit.
With the drought in full effect, there was nothing to prevent invading skaters from turning someone's backyard paradise into a riotous ensemble.
No pool was left untouched, and any kid could be king for a day.
There'd be five or ten guys really rocking and rolling in the bowl.
Each pushing each other's limits.
It was an incredible scene.
You could feel the energy coming out of the pool.
It was intense.
Just to be there standing on the deck was hardcore, because you were privy to something that you don't readily see anywhere else, you know?
If you were in the pool, standing in there, getting ready to take a run, you were even badder.
But if you were an actual player, you know, busting moves and pushing the limits of the session going on, you were a straight-out punk rock star.
I mean, big time.
We pushed each other all the time. We pushed and praised.
You'd come off of a heavy grind, and then all your bros are hooting.
We were getting each other's adrenaline levels so high, that's how the stuff evolved.
On any given day, anybody was the best.
It was almost like a daily competition between all of us to see who could pull off the hottest shit.
And then we'd look up into the shallow end at each other and go, "Wow!"
When Tony Alva, or Stacy Peralta, or Jay Adams, or Shogo, or Biniak, or Muir, any of these guys steps into a pool, it's like, even if they didn't know them, as soon as these guys rode,
other people would just want to sit down and watch and learn.
I mean, that's what it really was. You talk about special.
ZBOY'S RULE
So many other sports are so derivative of something else.
Even what Michael Jordan does, you know, other people play basketball, and he took it to another level.
And skateboarding, in a very great sense, comes from surfing.
But when Tony and Jay and Stacy started doing it, it was like it was coming from a whole new realm.
We really didn't know what was possible.
It had never been done before.
I think that people sometimes think that we were thinking about all this when it was happening. Nobody was thinking about it when it was happening.
I think we talked about it afterwards, after, like, actually trying these things,
- but it was pretty much spontaneous.
- There were no precedents.
They set precedents every single day when they went out and rode.
We worked so hard to get those pools that we didn't want other people going there, because we knew if we took other people, they'd bring other people, and eventually, the pool would be lost.
We'd just keep them really, like, low profile.
You know, we wouldn't let anybody know about them.
It was almost like a local surf spot where, you know, you're not coming in.
And if you came in without our permission, you were gonna get whupped.
You didn't show up with somebody at the pool. You had to have a meeting about that kind of shit.
You had to have a meeting, and that had to be voted.
You could argue about it, do whatever you want.
Bottom line was, you didn't clear it with the crew, and you brought someone to the pool, you know what'd happen?
You couldn't skate the pool.
I'm not shitting you. Almost happened to me.
Let's hold it one second.
With the invention of the urethane wheel and the ability to ride new terrain came a groundswell of enthusiasm as skateboarding once again began to grab the attention of teens across the country.
Rumors of a national contest began circulating, prompting Ho and Engblom to build and equip their team with boards and a ragtag uniform.
We had these shirts, we had Levis, and we had dark blue Vans.
And that was our uniform, and everybody complied to that.
That's what we wore. That's just what came up from the neighborhood.
Well, we all pretty much had grown up together, you know, and we had all been riding together, so there was a lot of camaraderie there.
And yet, at the same time, there was a competitive drive.
You know, from that P.O.P. energy, where everyone was riding each other. If you're not gonna do well, you don't deserve to do this, right?
That's what made us, like, a step above everybody, is that we were used to competing with each other.
One of Z-Boys was always with one of Z-Boys.
And, like, we were so tightly knit as a group that we sort of used each other's different qualities to come up with a style which, in the end, ended up being unique, you know.
We each had our own style, but it was really a combination of all of us flowing together.
And Skip and Jeff sort of assessing our moves, and saying, "Yeah, that looks good, man."
I remember Skipper coaching me on how to hold my hands.
And that I was holding my hands wrong, and that it looked bad, it was bad style.
The skateboard team was good because it gave everybody a sense of regimentation.
You know, something that you did from 3:00 till 5:00 every day or, you know...
You know, it's like daycare.
Skip would really hassle you if you screwed up, but, at the same time, he would take your time and give you the gentle pat on the back.
A little advice. He kept us in line.
He wanted us to be radical. He wanted us to be out there in the limelight. He wanted us to be visible.
He wanted our moves to be recognized. He wanted all of that stuff for us.
But what he didn't want was, he didn't want us in jail, he didn't want us getting run over by the buses when we were doing Berts under the back wheels.
You know? But, at the same time, he wanted us to be rad.
If you looked at the story of Peter Pan and The Lost Boys,
Pan took the children and they defeated Captain Hook, right?
But in my world, and in the world of the Zephyr shop, I would be Captain Hook.
And we, essentially, defeated Pan, and we've turned them all into pirates.
In 1975, Bahne skateboards, the leading manufacturer of boards and wheels, resurrected competition by spearheading the first major skateboard contest since the mid 1960s, the Del Mar Nationals.
The competitive setup was based on a classic '60s model.
A plywood ramp with a top coat of urethane was built for slalom racing,
and a small wooden platform was erected for freestyle.
Attention all skaters, please report to the freestyle area.
All skaters to the freestyle area.
The dated contest format did not end there, as many of the top competitors were performing the upright maneuvers made popular during skateboarding's brief boom in the '60s.
"...the world wasn't ready for the Z-Boys." "...there was so much aggression,
"they were more like a street gang than a skate team!"
We get to Del Mar and there's this little freestyle area that's about 12 by 12, with plywood and some urethane coating on it or something.
And we're looking at each other, going, "What the hell are we supposed to do with this?"
Del Mar would be the Zephyr team's first introduction to the world of organized skateboarding.
Their unconventional skating and disorderly presence marked them as outsiders right from the start.
It was like a hockey team going to a figure skating contest.
The difference between us and them felt very real.
Inspired by Larry Bertlemann's low, pivotal style and the vertical walls of pool riding, the Z-Boys took skateboarding's traditional upright approach and drove it right into the ground.
They didn't like us from the first part they saw us, because, you know, we weren't of the status quo, for what they were into.
People were just looking at us, like, "Wow, what is this?"
"I mean, these guys, man, Zephyr guys, this isn't skateboarding."
And I remember me and Jay were, like,
"What are you talking about? This is skateboarding, man."
"What the hell are you guys doing, you know, nose wheelies and all that?"
We were the rock 'n' roll, heavy metal of Dogtown.
We came prepared to kick these dudes' ass.
And we got inside their head instantly.
Man, I put on my best pimp gear, walked up there, pushed these moms and dads out of the way, threw down our entry blanks and asked for our trophies.
We had the ammo, and we knew we were just gonna bust out and blow minds.
Our purpose was to go there and shut these guys down.
Shut down Ty Page, shut down Paul Engh, shut down Hester, shut down Skoldberg.
All those guys, dude.
The first skater from the Zephyr team to enter the competition was its youngest and most naturally gifted,
13-year-old Jay Adams, whose explosive energy and bold moves epitomized the Dogtown style.
Jay Adams went out for his first freestyle routine, the first guy they've seen of our whole group... and we knew that they didn't know what they were about to see.
And boom! Their world had changed. It would never be the same for skateboarding again.
He was doing tricks he'd never even done before.
I remember Jay doing Berts off the side of the platform. Remember that?
Off the platform, down onto the ground, and hopping back up on the platform and skating.
People were just flipping out. They couldn't believe that.
And I remember just looking at him, bugging out.
He was spinning nose 360s crouched on his board. He'd never done that before!
Many of the competitors, accustomed to the more upright classical form, were not impressed.
They were unconventional, and they didn't care if they were judged well, you know?
They were just there to, you know, skate and get rowdy and have fun.
Bruce Logan, Russ Howell and Ty Page, these guys were great skaters.
But the skating maneuvers were based on a '60s paradigm.
And we decided to do it like surfers from the '70s.
They had never bent their knees and done, like, a Bertlemann turn on their skateboards.
There was not a single soul that was skating our style.
They were all riding around like stick men, man, and we were like slipping and sliding and jamming, getting in every little pocket.
They didn't know how to judge it. They didn't know how to put it in their criteria and spit out a first place.
Some of the girls didn't like the fact that I skated like a guy, and so they protested me to the judges.
And one of the judges said that I skated better than some of the guys!
Peggy Oki took first place in the Women's Freestyle.
Jay Adams and Tony Alva took 3rd and 4th place, respectively, in the Junior Men's Freestyle.
And Nathan Pratt took 4th place in the Junior Men's Slalom.
The Zephyr team's infectious presence and abundant talent pool whet the appetite of the industry's most prominent skateboard manufacturers.
All the other companies decided they needed one of you guys to be on their team, so they went after all you guys.
Six months after the Del Mar event, Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom would lose the very skateboard team they'd worked so hard to build.
A year later, because of mounting business problems, they would close the Zephyr shop.
It would never again reopen for business.
