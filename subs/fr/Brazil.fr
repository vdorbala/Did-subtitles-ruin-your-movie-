A fiddler on the roof.
Sounds crazy, no?
But here, in our little village of Anatevka, you might say every one of us is a fiddler on the roof.
Trying to scratch out a pleasant, simple tune without breaking his neck.
It isn't easy.
You may ask why do we stay up there if it's so dangerous?
Well, we stay because Anatevka is our home.
And how do we keep our balance?
That I can tell you in one word:
Tradition.
~ Tradition ~
~ Tradition ~
Because of our traditions, we've kept our balance for many, many years.
Here in Anatevka, we have traditions for everything.
How to sleep. How to eat. How to work.
How to wear clothes.
For instance, we always keep our heads covered, and always wear a little prayer shawl.
This shows our constant devotion to God.
You may ask, how did this tradition get started?
I'll tell you.
I don't know.
But it's a tradition.
And because of our traditions, every one of us knows who he is and what God expects him to do.
~ Who, day and night, must scramble for a living ~
~ Feed a wife and children, say his daily prayers ~
~ And who has the right as master of the house ~
~ To have the final word at home ~
~ The papa ~
~ The papa ~
~ Tradition ~ ~ The papa ~
~ The papa ~
~ Who must know the way to make a proper home ~
~ A quiet home, a kosher home ~
~ Who must raise a family and run the home ~
~ So Papa's free to read the Holy Book ~
~ The mama ~
~ The mama ~
~ Tradition ~
~ At three I started Hebrew school ~
~ At ten I learned a trade ~
~ I hear they picked a bride for me ~
~ I hope she's pretty ~
~ And who does Mama teach to mend and tend and fix ~
~ Preparing her to marry whoever Papa picks ~
~ The daughters ~
~ The daughters ~
~ Tradition ~
And in the circle of our little village, we've always had our special types.
For instance, Yente, the matchmaker.
Reb Nachum, the beggar.
And, most important of all, our beloved rabbi.
Rabbi, may I ask you a question? Certainly, Leibesh.
Is there a proper blessing for the Tzar?
A blessing for the Tzar? Of course.
May God bless and keep the Tzar... far away from us.
Then there are the others in our village.
They make a much bigger circle.
We don't bother them and, so far, they don't bother us.
And among ourselves, we always get along perfectly well.
Of course, there was the time when he sold him a horse and told him it was only six years old when it was really twelve.
But now it's all over. And we all live in simple peace and harmony.
- It was really twelve years old. - It was six.
Tevye knows it was twelve.
Twelve.
It was twelve.
~ Tradition ~
~ Tradition ~
Traditions, traditions.
Without our traditions, our lives would be as shaky as... as...
As a fiddler on the roof.
Mama, Yente the matchmaker is coming.
Maybe she's finally found a good match for you, Tzeitel.
From your mouth to God's ears.
Why is she here now?
It's almost Sabbath. Out, all of you.
I want to talk to Yente alone.
But, Mama, the men she finds...
The last one was so old. And he was bald.
He had no hair.
A poor girl without a dowry can't be so particular.
You want hair, marry a monkey.
Even a poor girl has to look at her husband sometimes.
A husband is not to look at, a husband is to get.
- I'm not yet 20 years old.
I don't think... - Sha! Do you have to boast about your age?
You wanna tempt the evil eye? Da, da, da.
There's work to be done before the Sabbath.
Golde. Golde.
I have such news for you.
And not every-day-in-the-week news.
Once-in-a-lifetime news.
Such diamonds, such jewels.
I'll find a husband for every one of them.
But you shouldn't be so picky. Right? Of course, right.
After all, even the worst husband is better than no husband.
God forbid!
Who should know better than me?
Ever since my husband died, I've been a poor widow. All alone, no one to talk to, nothing to say to anyone.
All I do at night is think of him. And even thinking of him gives me no pleasure.
- Is Tzeitel in the house?
- Why don't you go and find out?
Thank you, Bielke.
He never raised his voice.
Good afternoon. Is Tzeitel in the house?
She's busy.
Come back later.
There's something I'd like to tell her.
- Later.
Hm.
What does that poor skinny tailor want with Tzeitel?
They've been friends since they were babies.
They play... - They play?
What do they play?
- I don't know.
They're children.
From such children come other children.
Motel is nothing.
Yente, you said you had news for me.
Ah, children, children...
They are your blessing in your old age.
But my Aaron, may he rest in peace, couldn't give me children.
To tell you the truth, he hardly tried.
But what's the use complaining? Other women enjoy complaining.
Not Yente.
Not every woman in the world is a Yente.
Well, I have to go home now to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.
So, goodbye, Golde.
And it was a pleasure talking our hearts out to each other.
You said you had news for me.
I'm losing my head.
Some day it will fall off altogether. And a horse will kick it in the mud and "Goodbye, Yente".
Of course, the news.
It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher. A good man.
A fine man.
And I don't have to tell you he's well off, no?
But he's lonely, the poor man.
He's been a widower all these years. You understand?
Of course you do.
To make it short, out of the whole town he's cast his eye on Tzeitel.
- My Tzeitel?
- No, the Tzar's Tzeitel.
Of course your Tzeitel.
Such a match for my Tzeitel.
But Tevye wants a learned man.
He doesn't like Lazar.
Lazar won't marry him.
He wants the daughter, not the father.
Listen to me, Golde.
You send Tevye to him.
Don't tell him what it's about.
Let Lazar discuss it himself. He'll win him over, he's a good man and a wealthy man.
You'll let me know how it went.
And you don't have to thank me, Golde, because, aside from my fee, which Lazar will pay anyway, it gives me satisfaction to make people happy.
True?
Of course, true.
So, goodbye, Golde, and you're welcome.
Goodbye, Yente.
Come, children. Get changed for the Sabbath.
Hurry with your work.
I wonder if Yente found a husband for you.
I'm not anxious for her to find me one.
- Unless it's Motel, the tailor.
- I didn't ask you.
Tzeitel, they have to make a match for you before they can make one for me.
- Then after her, one for me. - So if Yente...
Yente, Yente, Yente!
Somebody has to arrange the matches.
- She may bring someone wonderful. - Interesting. - And well off.
~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match ~
~ Find me a find, catch me a catch ~
~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, look through your book ~
~ And make me a perfect match ~
~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, I'll bring the veil ~
~ You bring the groom, slender and pale ~
~ Bring me a ring for I'm longing to be the envy of all I see ~
~ For Papa, make him a scholar ~
~ For Mama, make him rich as a king ~
~ For me, well, I wouldn't holler if he were as handsome as anything ~
~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match ~
~ Find me a find, catch me a catch ~
~ Night after night in the dark I'm alone ~
~ So find me a match of my own ~
Since when are you interested in a match, Chava?
I thought you just had your eye on your books.
And you have your eye on the rabbi's son.
Why not?
We only have one rabbi and he only has one son.
Why shouldn't I want the best?
Because you're from a poor family, so whatever Yente brings, you'll take.
Right?
Of course, right.
~ Hodel, oh, Hodel, have I made a match for you ~
~ He's handsome, he's young - all right, he's sixty-two ~
~ But he's a nice man, a good catch ~ ~ True?
True ~
~ I promise you'll be happy and even if you're not ~
~ There's more to life than that - don't ask me what ~
~ Chava, I found him, will you be a lucky bride ~
~ He's handsome, he's tall - that is, from side to side ~
~ But he's a nice man, a good catch, right?
~
~ Right ~
~ You heard he has a temper He'll beat you every night ~
~ But only when he's sober - so you're all right ~
~ Did you think you'd get a prince ~
~ Well, I'll find the best I can ~
~ With no dowry, no money ~
~ No family background ~
~ Be glad you've got a man ~
~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, you know that I'm still very young ~
~ Please, take your time ~
~ Up to this minute I misunderstood ~
~ That I could get stuck for good ~
~ Dear Yente, see that he's gentle ~
~ Remember, you were also a bride ~
~ It's not that I'm sentimental ~
~ It's just that I'm terrified ~
~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, plan me no plans ~
~ I'm in no rush, maybe I've learned ~
~ Playing with matches, a girl can get burned ~
~ So bring me no ring, groom me no groom ~
~ Find me no find, catch me no catch ~
~ Unless he's a matchless match ~
Dear God, was that necessary?
Did you have to make him lame just before the Sabbath?
That wasn't nice.
It's enough you pick on me.
Bless me with five daughters, a life of poverty, that's all right.
But what have you got against my horse?
Really, sometimes I think, when things are too quiet up there, you say to yourself,
"Let's see. What kind of mischief can I play on my friend, Tevye?"
So you're finally here, my breadwinner.
I'll talk to you later.
- Why are you late today?
- His foot went lame. Hurry up.
The sun won't wait.
I have something important to say to you.
I still have deliveries.
- You'll be late for the Sabbath.
- I won't be late.
- You'll be late.
- I won't be late. I won't be late.
- If you ever stop talking, I won't be late.
- You can die from such a man.
As the Good Book says "Heal us, O Lord, and we shall be healed."
In other words, send us the cure. We've got the sickness already.
Well, I'm not really complaining.
After all, with your help... I'm starving to death.
Oh, dear Lord.
You made many, many poor people.
I realise, of course, it's no shame to be poor.
But it's no great honour either.
So what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune.
~ If I were a rich man ~
~ All day long, I'd biddy biddy bum ~
~ If I were a wealthy man ~
~ I wouldn't have to work hard ~
~ If I were a biddy biddy rich idle deedle daidle daidle man ~
~ I'd build a big, tall house ~
~ With rooms by the dozen right in the middle of the town ~
~ A fine, tin roof with real wooden floors below ~
~ There would be one long staircase just going up ~
~ And one even longer coming down ~
~ And one more leading nowhere, just for show ~
~ I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese ~
~ And ducks for the town to see and hear ~
~ Squawking just as noisily as they can ~
~ And each agay and ago and aga and aca ~
~ Will land like a trumpet on the ear ~
~ As if to say, here lives a wealthy man ~
~ If I were a rich man ~
~ All day long, I'd biddy biddy bum ~
~ If I were a wealthy man ~
~ I wouldn't have to work hard ~
~ If I were a biddy biddy rich idle deedle daidle daidle man ~
~ I'd see my wife, my Golde ~
~ Looking like a rich man's wife with a proper double chin ~
~ Supervising meals to her heart's delight ~
~ I'd see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock ~
~ Oh, what a happy mood she's in ~
~ Screaming at her servants day and night ~
~ The most important men in town will come to fawn on me ~
~ They will ask me to advise them like a Solomon The Wise ~
~ If you please, Reb Tevye ~
~ Pardon me, Reb Tevye ~
~ Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes ~
~ And it won't make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong ~
~ When you're rich, they think you really know ~
~ If I were rich I'd have that time that I lack ~
~ To sit in the synagogue and pray ~
~ And maybe have a seat by the eastern wall ~
~ And I'd discuss the Holy Books with the learned men seven hours every day ~
~ And that would be the sweetest thing of all ~
~ If I were a rich man ~
~ Yubby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dibby dum ~ ~ All day long, I'd biddy biddy bum ~
~ If I were a wealthy man ~
~ I wouldn't have to work hard ~
~ Lord, who made the lion and the lamb ~
~ You decreed I should be what I am ~
~ Would it spoil some vast eternal plan ~
~ If I were a wealthy man ~
Tevye, where's your horse?
It decided to take the day off.
- Have a good Sabbath.
- Thank you, Your Honour.
- It's almost the Sabbath.
- You kept us all waiting.
Look at this. Look what it says in the paper.
Quiet!
Will you stop braying like mules?
Let the man talk. Talk, Avram.
My paper came to the post office today, like it does every week.
Usually on a Thursday, but sometimes...
Avram, that's not talking.
That's babbling.
The news, what does it say?
Quiet!
Talk, Avram.
I was reading my paper.
Nothing important, a story about the crops in the Ukraine, and this and that.
Avram, talk.
And then I saw this.
All right.
We all see it.
What does it say?
"In a village called Rajanka, all the Jews were evicted, forced to leave their homes."
For what reason?
It doesn't say.
Maybe the Tzar wanted their land. Maybe a plague.
- May he have his own personal plague.
Why don't you ever bring us some good news?
It's not my fault. I only read it.
"An edict from the authorities."
May the authorities grow like onions, with their heads in the ground.
What good will your cursing do?
You stand around, you curse and you chatter, and you don't do anything.
- You'll all chatter your way into the grave.
- Excuse me.
- You're not from this village.
- No. - Where are you from?
- Kiev.
I was a student in the university.
Tell me, is that the place where you learned how not to respect your elders?
That is where I learned there is more to life than talk.
You should know what's going on in the outside world.
Why break my head about the outside world?
Let the outside world break its own head.
Well put.
He is right.
As the Good Book says,
"If you spit in the air, it lands in your face."
Nonsense.
You can't close your eyes to what's happening in the world.
- He's right and he's right?
They can't both be right.
You are also right.
He's too young to wipe his own nose.
Good Sabbath, Tevye.
Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath, Tevye.
- I'm sorry. I apologise.
- Tevye, the rabbi's order.
- Of course.
So you're from Kiev, Reb?
- Perchik.
So you're a newcomer here, huh?
As Abraham said, "I'm a stranger in a strange land."
Moses said that. Forgive me.
As King David said, "I'm slow of speech and slow of tongue."
That was also Moses.
For a man with a slow tongue, he talked a lot.
Here, Reb Perchik. Have a piece.
I have no money, and I'm not a beggar.
Take it.
It's a blessing for me to give.
Very well.
For your sake.
Thank you.
It's no crime to be poor.
It is the rich who are the criminals. Some day, their wealth will be ours.
That would be nice.
If they would agree, I would agree.
And who will make this miracle to come to pass?
Ordinary people.
- Like you?
- Like me.
Until your golden day comes, Reb Perchik, how will you live?
By giving lessons to children.
Do you have children?
I have five daughters.
Five?
Daughters.
Girls should learn, too. Girls are people. - A radical.
- Go away.
I'd be willing to teach them, open their minds to great thoughts.
I'd like them to know the Good Book.
The Bible has many lessons for our times.
Perchik,
I'm a very poor man.
But, food for lessons, huh? Good.
Stay with us for the Sabbath.
Of course, we don't eat like kings, but we don't starve either.
As the Good Book says,
"When a poor man eats a chicken, one of them is sick."
- Where does the Book say that?
- All right, all right.
It doesn't exactly say that, but some place, it mentions a chicken. - Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.
Good Sabbath, children.
Children, this is Perchik.
- Perchik, this is my eldest daughter. - Good Sabbath.
- You have a pleasant daughter.
- I have five pleasant daughters.
This is mine.
And this is mine.
And this is mine.
And this is mine.
And this is mine. And...
Well, this is not mine.
Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil.
So, you did us a favour and came home.
This is also mine.
Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev. He's staying the Sabbath with us.
He's a teacher.
Would you like lessons from him?
- Yes, Papa.
- I'm a very good teacher.
I heard that the rabbi who must praise himself has a congregation of one.
Your daughter has a quick and witty tongue.
The wit she gets from me.
- As the Good Book says... - The Good Book can wait.
Get washed.
- The tongue she gets from her mother.
- Motel, you're also eating with us?
Of course.
Another blessing.
Tzeitel, get the small table. Chava, the chairs from outside.
Children, finish dressing.
You can wash at the well.
Hurry, it's almost the Sabbath.
Tevye, I've something to say to you.
Why should today be different?
I have something to tell you.
- I have something to tell you.
- Yente was here.
I saw her.
If they agree on a match, it will be too late for us.
But I have found someone who will sell me his used sewing machine.
In a few weeks, I'll be able to buy it. - Then your father...
- It might be too late.
- Lazar Wolf wants to see you.
- The butcher? What about?
I don't know.
Only he says it's important.
What can be important?
I have nothing for him to slaughter.
After the Sabbath, talk with him.
About what?
If he's thinking about buying my new milk cow, he can forget it.
- Tevye, I want you to talk. - Shh.
Tevye.
Tevye, I want you to talk to...
What else can I do?
You could ask my father for my hand tonight.
Now. Why should he consider me now?
I'm only a poor tailor.
And I'm only the daughter of a poor milkman.
- Just talk to him.
- If your father says no, that's it.
- He'll yell at me. - Motel...
- I'm just a poor tailor. - Motel!
Even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness.
That's true.
A man sends you an important a message, at least you can talk to him.
All right, after the Sabbath I'll talk to him.
All right, I'll talk to him.
It's getting late.
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, Papa.
Children, come down.
We are lighting the candles.
- Reb Tevye...
- Not now, Motel.
Hurry up, children.
- Reb Tevye.
- Not now.
Golde, the sun is almost down. - Reb Tevye...
- What is it?
- Reb Tevye... - Yes?
- Reb Tevye...
Well, Motel, what is it?
Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye.
Good Sabbath.
Good Sabbath.
Hurry up.
Hurry, children, hurry. It's getting late.

Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?
- He's in the back.
May I...
- Come in. - Thank you.
Thank you.
And all this from killing innocent animals?
- Don't touch anything. - All right.
Well, Tevye.
You're here. Sit down.
Sit down.
Thank you.
- Have a drink.
- I won't insult you by saying no.
How goes it with you, Reb Tevye?
- How should it go? - You're right.
- And you?
- The same.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How is your brother-in-law in America?
- He's doing very well. - He wrote you?
- Not lately.
- How do you know?
If he was doing badly, he would write.
- Lechaim.
- Lechaim.
I suppose you know why I wanted to see you.
Yes, I do, but...
There is no use talking about it.
Tevye, I understand how you feel, but after all you have a few more without her.
Today you want one.
Tomorrow you may want two. Two?
What would I do with two?
The same as you do with one.
This is very important to me.
Why is it so important to you?
Frankly, because... I'm lonely.
Lonely?
Reb Lazar, what are you talking about?
How can a little cow keep you company?
Little cow?
- Is that what you call her?
- But that's what she is. - What are you talking about?
- Don't you know?
Of course, I know.
We are talking about the milk cow you want to buy from me.
A milk cow.
A milk cow so I won't be lonely?
I'm talking about... your daughter Tzeitel.
My daughter Tzeitel?
Of course, your daughter Tzeitel.
I see her every Thursday in my butcher's shop. And she's made a very good impression on me.
A very good impression.
Reb Tevye, I like her.
Why don't we just shake hands and call it a match, huh?
I will be good to her.
I like her.
Well?
What do you think?
- What do I think?
I never really liked him.
Why should I?
You can have a fine conversation with him if you talk about kidneys and livers.
On the other hand, not everyone has to be a scholar.
And with a butcher, my daughter will surely never know hunger.
Maybe I misjudged him.
He's a good man.
He likes her.
And he'll try to make her happy.
What do I think?
It's a match.
- You agree?
- I agree.
Tevye, you've made me a happy man.
- Let's drink on it.
- Why not?
- To you. - No, my friend.
To you.
- To the both of us.
- To our agreement.
To our prosperity.
To our good health and happiness.
And most important of all...

Tevye, after the marriage,
You will be my papa.
Your papa.
Lazar Wolf,
I always wanted a son. But I wanted one a little younger than myself.
Good night.
I hear that congratulations are in order, Tevye.
Thank you, Your Honour. Thank you.
Yes, Your Honour?
I have some news I think I should tell you as a friend. Yes, Your Honour?
I'm giving you this news because I like you.
You're an honest, decent person, even though you are a Jew.
Thank you, Your Honour.
How often does a man get a compliment like that?
And the news?
Sometime soon this district is to have a little unofficial demonstration.
What?
A pogrom here?
No, just a little unofficial demonstration.
Little?
How little?
Just some mischief.
So, if an inspector comes through, he can see we did our duty.
I don't know why there has to be this trouble between people. But I thought I should tell you.
Thank you, Your Honour.
You are a good man.
If I may say so... It's too bad you're not a Jew.
That's what I like about you.
You're always joking.
Congratulations again for your daughter.
Thank you, Your Honour.
Oh, about the other matter.
It won't be too bad. I wouldn't worry.
Of course not.
Dear God, did you have to send me news like that today of all days?
I know we are the chosen people.
But once in a while, can't you choose someone else?
Anyway, thank you for sending a husband for my Tzeitel.
Lechaim.
Now, after Jacob had worked for Laban for seven years, do you know what happened?
Laban fooled him and gave him his ugly daughter Leah.
So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced to work another seven years.
So, you see, the Bible clearly teaches us you can never trust an employer.
And that is what the Bible teaches us?
That is the lesson of the story of Jacob if you interpret it correctly.
- Is your papa up yet?
- No, Mama.
Enough lessons. Back to the house.
There's work to be done.
Go on, children.
Another story tomorrow.
That was a very interesting lesson, Perchik.
- Do you think so?
Although I don't know if the rabbi would agree with your interpretation.
Neither, I suppose, would the rabbi's son.
My little sisters talk too much.
And what do you know about him, except that he is the rabbi's son?
At least I know he has no strange ideas about turning the world upside down.
Good day, Perchik.
You have wit, even some intelligence.
Perhaps, but what good is your brain?
Without curiosity, it is a rusty tool.
Good day, Hodel.
We have an old custom here.
A boy talks respectfully to a girl.
But that is too traditional for an advanced thinker like you.
Our traditions.
Nothing must change.
Everything is perfect as it is.
- We like our ways.
- Our ways are changing all over but here.
In the city boys and girls are affectionate without the permission of a matchmaker.
They hold hands together. They even dance together. New dances like this.
I learned it in Kiev.
- Do you like it?
- It's very nice.
There.
We've just changed an old custom.
Yes.
I mean, thank you.
I mean, good day.
So, my prince is finally out of bed.
Open your eyes.
The day's half gone.
Well, what happened last night, besides you drinking like a peasant?
Did you see Lazar Wolf?
What did he say?
What did you say?
- Where's Tzeitel? - She's in the barn.
Do you have news for me?
Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?
- What happened?
- Patience, woman, patience.
As the Good Book says, "Good news will stay, and bad news will refuse to leave."
- And another saying goes...
- You can die from such a man.
Did you see Lazar?
How was it?
Are you still drunk or what?
Ah, here she is.
Tzeitel, my lamb. Come here.
You are to be congratulated.
- You are going to be married.
Married!
What do you mean, Papa?
Lazar Wolf has asked for your hand.
- I knew it.
- The butcher?
Dear God, I thank thee.
Why do you have to?
- What do you have to say, Tzeitel?
- What can she say?
- Let her say one word.
- My first-born a bride.
May you grow old with him in fortune and honour.
Not like Fruma Sarah, his first wife.
She was a bitter woman, may she rest in peace.
Not like my Tzeitel.
And now I must thank Yente.
My Tzeitel a bride.
A bride! I thank thee.
I thank thee.
Well, Chava?
Mazel tov, Tzeitel.
"Mazel tov, Tzeitel."
What kind of a mazel tov is that?
And you, Reb Perchik, aren't you going to congratulate her?
Congratulations, Tzeitel, for getting a rich man.
Again with the rich.
What's wrong with being rich?
It's no reason to marry.
Money's the world's curse.
May the Lord smite me with it.
And may I never recover.
World's curse.
My Tzeitel knows I mean only her welfare.
Am I right, Tzeitel?
- Yes, Papa.
- There, you see?
I see.
I see very well.
Well, my child?
Why are you so silent?
Aren't you happy with this blessing, huh?
What is it?
Tell me.
Papa, I don't want to marry him.
I can't marry him.
I can't.
What do you mean, you can't?
If I say you will, you will.
If it's a matter of money, I'll do anything.
I'll hire myself out as a servant...
But we made an agreement.
And with us, an agreement is an agreement.
Is that more important than I am, Papa?
Papa, don't force me, please!
I'll be unhappy all my days.
- I don't want to marry him.
I won't force you.
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you.
"Thank you, Papa."
It seems it was not ordained that you should have all the comforts of life.
- Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?
- Later, Motel.
- But I would like to speak to you.
- Not now. I have problems.
That's what I want to speak to you about.
I think I can help.
Like a bandage can help a corpse.
Goodbye, Motel.
At least listen to him, Papa.
All right, you have a tongue. Talk.
I hear you are arranging a match for Tzeitel.
Ah, he also has ears.
- I have a match for Tzeitel.
- What kind of a match?
A perfect fit.
Like a glove.
This match was made exactly to measure.
Perfect fit? Made to measure?
Stop talking like a tailor and tell me, who is it?
- Please don't shout at me.
- All right.
All right, I won't shout.
Who is it?
Who is it?
- Who is it?
- Who is it?
Who is it? !
It's me.
Myself.
It's him.
Himself.
Either you're out of your mind or you're crazy.
He must be crazy.
Arranging a match for yourself? What are you?
Everything?
Bridegroom, matchmaker, and guests rolled into one?
I suppose you'll perform the ceremony, too?
Please don't shout at me.
As for being my matchmaker, I know it's unusual.
Unusual?
It's crazy.
Times are changing.
Over a year ago, Tzeitel and I gave each other our pledge that we would marry.
You gave each other a pledge?
Yes, Papa.
We gave each other our pledge.
They gave each other a pledge?
Unheard of. Absurd.
~ You gave each other a pledge - unthinkable ~
~ Where do you think you are, in Moscow, in Paris?
~
~ Where do they think they are, America?
~
~ What do you think you're doing, you're a stitcher, you're nothing ~ ~ Who do you think you are, King Solomon?
~
~ This isn't the way it's done, not here, not now ~
~ Some things I will not, I cannot allow ~
~ Tradition ~
~ Marriages must be arranged by the papa ~
~ This should never be changed ~
~ One little time, you pull out a prop and where does it stop?
Where does it stop? ~
Where does it stop?
Do I still have something to say about my daughter?
Doesn't anyone have to ask a father any more?
I've wanted to ask you for a while, but first I wanted to get my own sewing machine.
Stop talking nonsense.
You are just a poor tailor.
That's true, but even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness.
I promise you, Reb Tevye, your daughter will not starve.
He's beginning to talk like a man.
On the other hand, what kind of a match would that be with a poor tailor?
On the other hand, he is an honest, hard worker.
But on the other hand, he has absolutely nothing.
On the other hand, things could never get worse for him, only better.
They gave each other a pledge. Unheard of. Absurd.
~ But look at my daughter's face, she loves him, she wants him ~
~ And look at my daughter's eyes ~
~ So hopeful ~
Tradition!
Well, children...
When shall we make the wedding?
Thank you, Papa.
Reb Tevye, you won't be sorry. You won't be sorry.
I won't be sorry?
I'm sorry already.
Thank you, Papa.
- Thank you, Papa.
They gave each other a pledge.
Golde.
What shall I tell Golde?
- Motel, you were wonderful.
- It was a miracle.
~ Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles ~
~ God took a Daniel once again ~
~ Stood by his side and miracle of miracles ~
~ Walked him through the lion's den ~
~ Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles ~
~ I was afraid that God would frown ~
~ But like he did so long ago in Jericho, God just made a wall fall down ~
~ When Moses softened Pharaoh's heart, that was a miracle ~
~ When God made the waters of the Red Sea part, that was a miracle, too ~
~ But of all God's miracles large and small, the most miraculous one of all ~
~ Is that out of a worthless lump of clay God has made a man today ~
~ Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles ~
~ God took a tailor by the hand ~
~ Turned him around and miracle of miracles ~
~ Led him to the Promised Land ~
~ When David slew Goliath, yes, that was a miracle ~
~ When God gave us manna in the wilderness, that was a miracle, too ~
~ But of all God's miracles large and small, the most miraculous one of all ~
~ Is the one I thought could never be ~
~ God has given you to me ~
- Good day.
- Hello, Sarah.
Mazel tov, Chava.
Soon it will be you. - I hope so.
- Give my best wishes to Tzeitel.
- Mazel tov, Chava.
No, don't.
Please, I just want... to get by.
- What's wrong with you, Fyedka? - Stop it.
- We're just having a little fun, Fyedka.
- Goodbye, Sasha.
I said goodbye.
I'm sorry about that.
They mean no harm.
Don't they?
Is there something you want?
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.
I'd rather not.
I've often noticed you at the bookseller's.
Not many girls in this village like to read.
Would you like to borrow this book?
It's very good.
No.
- Thank you.
Because I'm not Jewish?
Do you feel about me the way they feel about you?
I didn't think you would.
And what do you know about me, eh?
Let me tell you about myself.
I'm a pleasant fellow. Charming, honest, ambitious, quite bright, and very modest.
Go ahead.
Take the book.
And after you return it, I'll ask you how you like it.
And we can talk about it for a while. Then we can talk about life. How we feel about things.
Here.
Thank you.
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.
Fyedka.
Fyedka.
Help!
- Tell me, what's the matter with you?
Wake up. What is the matter with you?
- Where is she?
- Who?
- What are you talking about?
- Fruma Sarah.
Lazar Wolfs first wife was standing here a minute ago.
What are you talking about?
Fruma Sarah has been dead for years. Sha!
You must have been dreaming.
Now, tell me what you dreamt and I'll tell you what it meant.
Ooh, it was terrible. - Tell me.
- All right.
Only don't be frightened!
In the beginning, I dreamt that... we were having a celebration of some kind.
Everybody we knew, all of our beloved departed were there.
All of them.
Even your Great Uncle Mordechai was there. And your cousin Rachel was there.
And in the middle of the dream, in walks your grandmother Tzeitel, may she rest in peace.
Grandmother Tzeitel?
How did she look?
For a woman who is dead 30 years, she looked very good.
Naturally, I went up to greet her.
~ A blessing on your head Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ To see a daughter wed Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw ~
~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~
Motel?
~ A worthy boy is he Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ Of pious family Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ They named him after my dear Uncle Mordechai ~
~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~
Tailor?
- She heard wrong.
It's the butcher.
- I'll tell her.
~ You must have heard wrong, Grandma ~
~ There's no tailor ~
~ You mean the butcher, Grandma ~
~ By the name of Lazar Wolf ~
~ No, no, no I mean the tailor, Tevye ~
~ My great grandchild ~
~ My little Tzeitel, who you named for me ~
~ Motel's bride was meant to be ~
~ For such a match I prayed Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ In heaven it was made Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ A fine, upstanding boy, a comfort and a joy ~
~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~
We announced it already. We made a bargain with the butcher.
~ A blessing on your house Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ Imagine such a spouse Mazel tov, mazel tov ~
~ And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw ~
- Stop them. Listen to me.
But he is a butcher. Tell them.
- His name is Lazar Wolf.
~ The tailor Motel Kam...
Sha! ~
~ Look Who is this?
~
~ Who comes here? Who? Who?
Who? Who?
Who?
~
~ What woman is this, by righteous anger shaken ~
~ Could it be Yes, it could ~
~ Why not?
Who could be mistaken?
~ It's the butcher's wife come from beyond the grave ~
~ It's the butcher's dear, darling, departed wife Fruma Sarah ~
Tevye!
~ What is this about your daughter marrying my husband? ~
~ Yes, her husband ~
~ Would you do this to your friend and neighbour Fruma Sarah? ~
~ Fruma Sarah ~
~ Have you no consideration for a woman's feelings? ~
~ Woman's feelings ~
~ Handing over my belongings to a total stranger ~
~ Total stranger ~
~ How can you allow it?
How can you let your daughter take my place? ~
~ Live in my house, carry my keys and wear my clothes, pearls, how? ~
~ How can you allow your daughter to take her place?
~ Pearls? House?
~
~ Pearls? Keys?
~ ~ Pearls?
Clothes? ~
~ Pearls?
How? ~
Tevye!
~ Such a learned man as Tevye wouldn't let it happen ~
~ Let it happen ~
~ Tell me that it isn't true and then I wouldn't worry ~
~ Wouldn't worry ~
~ Say you didn't give your blessing to your daughter's marriage ~
~ Daughter's marriage ~
~ Let me tell you what would follow such a fatal wedding ~
~ Fatal wedding ~
Sha!
~ If Tzeitel marries Lazar Wolf ~
~ I pity them both ~
~ She'll live with him three weeks ~
~ And when three weeks are up ~
~ I'll come to her by night ~
~ I'll take her by the throat ~
~ And this I'll give your Tzeitel, that I'll give your Tzeitel ~
Jump!
Here's my wedding present if she marries Lazar Wolf!
May it sink back into the earth.
Such a dark and horrible dream.
And to think it was brought on because you went to see that butcher.
If my grandmother Tzeitel, may she rest in peace, took the trouble to come from the other world to tell us about the tailor, all I can say is that it's for the best and couldn't possibly be any better.
- But, Golde...
- Amen.
Amen.
Do you like these troublemakers?
These Christ-killers?
Of course not.
I just meant that things have been peaceful here.
I have other villages to visit.
If you don't want to follow orders, we shall get someone else who will.
Oh, no, no, no, no, sir.
I'll take care of it.
Of course.
Quiet down.
Quiet down.
~ Is this the little girl I carried?
~ Is this the little boy at play?
~ I don't remember growing older ~
~ When did they?
~ When did she get to be a beauty?
~ When did he grow to be so tall? ~
~ Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?
~ Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset ~
~ Swiftly flow the days ~
~ Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers ~
~ Blossoming even as we gaze ~
~ Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset ~
~ Swiftly fly the years ~
~ One season following another ~
~ Laden with happiness and tears ~
~ What words of wisdom can I give them?
~ How can I help to ease their way?
~ Now they must learn from one another ~
~ Day by day ~
~ They look so natural together ~
~ Just like two newlyweds should be ~
~ Is there a canopy in store for me?
~ Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset ~
~ Swiftly fly the years ~
~ One season following another ~
~ Laden with happiness ~
~ And tears ~
Take your places, everybody.
Quiet! Quiet down.
Quiet down.
Sha!
The newlyweds.
Friends, we are gathered here to share in the joys of the newlyweds,
May they live together to a ripe old age. - Amen.
- And now I want to say...
Reb Nachum...
Please not here.
I'd like to announce the bride's parents are giving the newlyweds the following:
A new feather bed, two pillows. Goose pillows.
A Sabbath tablecloth. And a pair of candlesticks.
Quiet!
Now, we are just here on earth for a short visit.
Even the great and wealthy must die.
In fact, if the rich could hire others to die for them, we, the poor, would all make a nice living.
Well put.
Well put.
Lazar Wolf, talking about the rich, there sits our good friend Lazar Wolf.
Lazar has everything in the world, except a bride.
But Lazar has no ill feelings.
In fact, he told me he has a gift for the newlyweds that he wants to announce.
Come on. Come on!
Just like he said, I have no ill feelings.
What's done is done.
I am giving the newlyweds five chickens. One for each of the first five Sabbaths of their wedded life.
Reb Lazar Wolf, you are a decent man. On behalf of my daughter and her new husband,
I accept your gift.
There is a famous saying...
Reb Tevye, I'm not marrying your daughter.
I don't have to listen to your sayings.
If you would only listen...
Why should I listen to you?
A man who breaks an agreement.
- I have a right to talk. - What right?
It's not your wedding.
- It should have been.
He shamed me in front of the whole village.
Rabbi, say something.
I say...
I say, let's sit down.
Yes, yes.
We all heard the words of the rabbi.
Let's sit down.
Now I'm going to sing a little song.
You can keep your diseased chickens.
You leave my chickens out of this.
- We made a bargain.
- The terms weren't settled. - We drank on it.
- Terms weren't settled.
You just sit down, all right?
Once a butcher, always a butcher.
- Once a liar, always a liar.
- Sit down, all right?
Those happen to be my chickens...
- I had a sign.
- Quiet, I'm singing.
Quiet! Quiet!
What's all the screaming about?
They drank on it. An agreement.
A sign.
It's all nonsense.
Tzeitel wanted to marry Motel and not Lazar.
A young girl decides for herself? Why not?
They love each other.
- Love?
- He's a radical.
Musicians, play. It's a dance.
Everybody, dance.
- It's a wedding.
Some wedding
- What is he doing?
Who will dance with me?
- It's no sin to dance.
- With a girl? - Yes!
That's what comes from taking a wild man into your house.
He's not a wild man.
His ideas are a bit different, but...
- It's a sin.
- It's no sin!
Ask the rabbi.
Go on, ask him.
Well, Rabbi?
Dancing?
Well, it's not exactly forbidden. There you see.
It's not forbidden.
And it's no sin.
Now... Who will dance with me?
- Hodel!
- It's only a dance, Mama.
Play.
- She's dancing with a man.
- I can see that she's dancing with a man.
- And I'm going to dance with my wife!
- Mama, no. - Golde.
You see that?
You are responsible for that.
- And I can't stand it.
Go on!
All right!
Enough!
I said, enough!
Come!
Orders are orders.
You understand?
Why are you all standing around?
Clean up.
Clean up!
~ Tradition ~
~ Tradition ~
Troubles, troubles.
That's all you hear from me, right?
But who else can we simple people take our troubles to?
You know, sometimes I wonder, who do you take your troubles to?
Ah, go away.
Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel have been married for some time now.
They work very hard. And they're as poor as squirrels in winter.
But they're so happy, they don't know how miserable they are.
Motel keeps talking about a sewing machine.
I know. You are very busy now.
Wars, revolutions, floods, plagues. All those little things that bring people back to you.
But couldn't you take a second and get him his sewing machine?
Yeah, and while you are in the neighbourhood... As you can see, my horse's leg...
Am I bothering you too much?
I'm sorry.
As the Good Book says...
Why should I tell you what the Good Book says? !
So you must go away?
Yes.
So soon?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning.
Alone?
No, with a few friends.
And we will be joining others.
- Where?
- In the city, Kiev.
Hodel, there are some things I cannot tell even you.
I see.
- Please don't be upset.
- If you must leave, you must.
- I do have to.
- So you told me.
Great changes are about to take place.
Tremendous changes.
But they can't happen by themselves.
- So you feel that you, personally, must...
- Not only me.
Many people.
Jews, Gentiles, many people hate what's going on. Don't you understand?
I understand, of course.
You want to leave.
Then, goodbye.
Hodel, listen to me.
I have work to do.
The greatest work a man can do.
Don't you understand?
Yes, Perchik.
Hodel, wait.
Hodel, there's a certain question I wish to discuss with you. - Yes?
- It's a political question.
- What is it?
- The question of... marriage.
Is this a political question?
Well, yes.
Everything's political.
The relationship between a man and a woman has a socioeconomic base.
Marriage must be founded on mutual beliefs. A common attitude and philosophy towards society...
And affection?
Yes, of course.
That is also necessary.
Such a relationship can have positive social values.
When two people face the world with unity and solidarity... - And affection?
- Yes, that is an important element.
At any rate, I... I personally am in favour of such a socioeconomic relationship.
I think... you are asking me to marry you.
Well, in a theoretical sense, yes, I am.
I was hoping you were.
I am very happy, Hodel.
I'm very, very happy.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.
- I have some bad news.
- What?
- I must leave here.
- When? - Tomorrow morning.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Perchik.
- We'll all miss you.
- But I also have some good news. - Good.
- You can congratulate me.
- Congratulations. What for?
- We are engaged.
- Engaged?
- Yes, Papa, we're engaged.
Oh, no, you're not.
I know you like him and he likes you.
But you're going away and you're staying here.
So have a nice trip, and I hope you'll be very happy and my answer is no.
- Papa, you don't understand.
- I understand.
I gave my permission to Motel and Tzeitel, so you feel you also have a right.
I'm sorry, Perchik, I like you.
But you're going away, so go in good health, and my answer is still no.
- You don't understand, Papa.
- And you are not listening. I said no.
Reb Tevye, we are not asking for your permission.
Only for your blessing.
We are going to get married.
You are not asking for my permission?
But we would like your blessing, Papa.
I can't believe my own ears.
My blessing?
For what?
~ For going over my head - impossible ~
~ At least with Tzeitel and Motel they asked me, they begged me ~
~ But now, if I like or not, you'll marry him ~
~ What do you want from me - go on, be wed ~
~ And tear out my beard and uncover my head ~
~ Tradition ~
~ They're not even asking permission from the papa ~
~ What's happening to the tradition? ~
~ One little time, I pulled out a thread and where has it led?
Where has it led? ~
Where has it led? To this.
A man tells me he's getting married.
He doesn't ask me, he tells me.
But first, he abandons you.
He's not abandoning me, Papa.
As soon as I can, I will send for her and marry her.
I love her.
He loves her.
Love.
It's a new style.
On the other hand, our old ways were once new, weren't they?
On the other hand, they decided without parents, without the matchmaker.
On the other hand, did Adam and Eve have a matchmaker?
Oh, yes, they did.
And it seems these two have the same matchmaker.
They're going over my head. Unheard of.
Absurd.
~ For this, they want to be blessed - unthinkable ~
I'll lock her up in her room.
I couldn't.
I should.
~ But look at my daughter's eyes ~
~ She loves him ~
Tradition!
Well, children, I've decided to give you my blessing and my permission.
Oh, thank you, Papa.
What else could I do?
Thank you, Papa.
"Thank you, Papa"?
What am I going to tell your mother?
Another dream?
Perhaps if you tell her I am going to visit a rich uncle.
Perchik, please.
I can handle my own wife.
- Have some soup.
I have something very important to tell you.
Have the soup.
It's warm.
I've just met Perchik and Hodel. - Well?
Well, they seem to be very fond of each other.
What do you mean?
So...
So, I've decided to give them my permission to become engaged.
- What?
Just like that, without even asking me?
Who asks you?
- I am the father. - Who is he?
A pauper.
He has nothing, absolutely nothing.
I wouldn't say that.
I hear he has a rich uncle.
A rich uncle.
Golde...
Golde, he's a good man.
I like him.
He's a little crazy, but I like him.
And what's more important, Hodel likes him.
Hodel loves him.
So what can we do?
It's a new world, Golde.
A new world.
Love.
Golde, do you love me?
- Do I what?
~ Do you love me? ~
~ Do I love you? ~
Well?
~ With our daughters getting married and this trouble in the town ~
~ You're upset, you're worn out, go inside, go lie down ~
- Maybe it's indigestion.
- No, Golde, I'm asking you a question.
~ Do you love me? ~
- You're a fool.
- I know.
~ But do you love me? ~
~ Do I love you? Well?
~
~ For 25 years, I've washed your clothes ~ ~ Cooked your meals, cleaned your house ~ ~ Given you children, milked your cow ~
~ After 25 years, why talk about love right now?
~ The first time I met you was on our wedding day ~
~ I was scared I was shy ~
~ I was nervous So was I ~
~ But my father and my mother said we'd learn to love each other ~
~ And now I'm asking, Golde ~
~ Do you love me? ~
- I'm your wife.
- I know.
~ But do you love me? ~
~ Do I love him? ~
Well?
~ For 25 years, I've lived with him ~ ~ Fought with him, starved with him ~
~ 25 years, my bed is his ~ Shh!
~ If that's not love, what is? ~
~ Then you love me? ~
I suppose I do.
~ And I suppose I love you, too ~
~ It doesn't change a thing ~
~ But even so ~
~ After 25 years ~
~ It's nice to know ~
There is no authority above the will of the people. And we are the people.
We are Russia!
The time has come, and the time is now.
We stand here before you. Not one, but many.
Many like you.
Students, workers striving for a better life.
And I urge you, fellow workers, to band together with us.
Join our movement, in the factories. In the schools.
In the army.
The winds of freedom are beginning to blow all over Russia.
Wait! Stand!
Good day to you, Esther.
Just a minute. Tzeitel.
- Good day, Yente.
I happened to stop in the post office today, to say hello, see what's what.
It doesn't cost anything to be friendly.
So few people are like that. - Ni, ni.
- People.
I tell you, if God lived on earth, people would break his windows.
- So you went to the post office.
- Yes, and the postman told me there was a letter for your sister Hodel.
- Thanks, I'll go get it.
- I got it.
It's from her intended - Perchik.
Hodel will be so happy.
She's been waiting to hear from him...
- But it's open.
- So it happened to be open.
You don't have to wait for the train, Papa.
You'll be late for customers.
It's all right.
They'll just have to wait for a while.
Is he in bad trouble, that hero of yours?
Arrested?
- Convicted? - Yes.
But he did nothing wrong. He cares nothing for himself.
Everything he does is for other people.
Yes, but if he did nothing wrong, he wouldn't be in trouble.
Papa, how can you say that?
What wrongs did Joseph do, and Abraham, and Moses?
And they had troubles.
Yes, but...
Why won't you tell me where he is now, this Joseph of yours?
It is far, Papa.
Terribly far.
He is in a settlement in Siberia.
Siberia?
And he asks you to leave your father and mother and join him in that frozen wasteland and marry him there?
No, Papa.
He did not ask me to go.
I want to go.
I don't want him to be alone. I want to help him in his work.
- Hodel.
~ How can I hope to make you understand? ~
~ Why I do what I do ~
~ Why I must travel to a distant land ~
~ Far from the home I love ~
~ Once I was happily content to be ~
~ As I was, where I was ~
~ Close to the people who are close to me ~
~ Here in the home I love ~
~ Who could see that a man would come ~
~ Who would change the shape of my dreams?
~ Helpless now I stand with him ~
~ Watching older dreams grow dim ~
~ Oh, what a melancholy choice this is ~
~ Wanting home, wanting him ~
~ Closing my heart to every hope but his ~
~ Leaving the home I love ~
~ There where my heart has settled long ago ~
~ I must go ~ ~ I must go ~
~ Who could imagine I'd be wandering so ~
~ Far from the home I love ~
~ Yet there with my love ~
~ I'm home ~
And who, my child, will there be to perform a marriage in the wilderness?
Papa, I promise you, we will be married under a canopy. Yes.
Yes.
No doubt a rabbi or two were also arrested.
God alone knows when we shall see each other again.
Then we will leave it in his hands.
Take care of her.
See that she dresses warm.
Even though she only burned his cooking, he is permitted to divorce her.
Just for supper?
I'm sorry, Rabbi.
Yes, of course.
What news of the outside world?
- Terrible, Rabbi.
- Then don't tell me.
If I want bad news, I'll read about Noah and the flood.
Tell me, Avram, surely somewhere there are good things happening?
Can't you buy a paper that prints those things?
It's not my fault, Rabbi. I only read it. Rabbi, did you hear the news?
- More bad news?
- No, good news.
At Motel's and Tzeitel's, a new arrival.
We just heard the good news.
Mazel tov.
Thank you very much.
It's a nice thing.
Very nice.
- What is it?
- It's a sewing machine.
You can work twice as fast.
- You got it.
- I got it.
- It's beautiful. - I know.
- Have you tried it yet?
- Beautiful. - I know.
And in less than a minute.
See how close and even the stitches are.
- It's beautiful. - I know.
From now on, my clothes will be perfect.
Made by machine.
No more handmade clothes.
- Look, Mama.
Look.
It's wonderful.
Mazel tov, Motel.
- The rabbi.
The rabbi. - Shh.
Rabbi, is there a blessing for a sewing machine?
There is a blessing for everything.
That's your new arrival?
What is it, a boy or a girl?
Yankela. Yankela.
Why isn't he asleep? But he's wonderful.
He never cries or anything... Sha!
Do you want to invite bad luck?
Well, Motel.
I never thought you'd amount to anything.
But look at you. A baby and a sewing machine.
You're a person.
- Look, I'll show you how it works.
First, you put the cloth in like this. It's an amazing thing.
You work it with your foot and your hand.
Your father is coming.
Chava, let me tell him about us.
That would be the worst thing.
- But let me try. - No.
I'll talk to him, I promise.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.
It's a cold day, isn't it?
Good day, sir.
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.
What were you and he talking about?
Nothing.
We were just talking.
Good.
Fyedka and I, we've known each other for a long time now, and...
Chaveleh, I would be much happier if you would remain friends from a distance.
You must not forget who you are and who that man is.
- He has a name, Papa. - Of course.
All creatures on earth have a name.
Fyedka is not a creature. Fyedka is a man.
Who says he isn't?
It's just that he's a different kind of man.
As the Good Book says,
"Each shall seek his own kind."
In other words, a bird may love a fish, but where would they build a home together?
- The world is changing.
- No, Chaveleh.
No.
Some things do not change for us.
Some things will never change.
We don't feel that way.
We?
Fyedka and I. We want to be married.
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you understand what that means, marrying outside of the faith? - But, Papa.
- No! I said no!
Never talk about it again.
Never mention his name again. Never see him again.
Never.
Do you understand me?
Yes, Papa.
I understand you.
You're finally here.
It's late for supper.
- I want to see Motel's new machine.
- You'll see it another time.
Quiet, woman, because when I get angry, even flies don't dare to fly!
I'm very frightened of you.
After we finish supper, I'll faint.
Golde, I am the man in the house.
I am the head of the family. And I want to see Motel's new machine now!
Now let's go home.
What are you doing here?
May I see His Honour, the priest?
- The Reverend Father? - Yes.
Why do you want to see him?
It's a family matter.
A personal matter.
- My daughter. - Yes?
What about your daughter?
Please, if I could speak with the p...
If I could speak with the Reverend Father. Please?
Wait here.
Tevye!
What is it?
It's Chava.
She left home this morning with Fyedka.
- What?
- I looked everywhere for her.
I even went to the priest.
He told me they were married.
Married?
Yes.
Go home, Golde.
We have other children at home.
You have work to do, I have work to do.
- Go home. - But Chaveleh...
Chava is dead to us.
We'll forget her.
Go home.
Go home, Golde.
~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~
~ I don't understand what's happening today ~
~ Everything is all a blur ~
~ All I can see is a happy child ~ ~ The sweet little bird you were, Chaveleh ~
~ Chaveleh ~
~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~
~ You were always such a pretty little thing ~
~ Everybody's favourite child ~
~ Gentle and kind and affectionate ~
~ What a sweet little bird you were, Chaveleh ~
~ Chaveleh ~
Papa.
Papa, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Papa, stop!
At least listen to me.
I beg you to accept us.
Accept them?
How can I accept them?
Can I deny everything I believe in?
On the other hand, can I deny my own daughter?
On the other hand, how can I turn my back on my faith, my people?
If I try and bend that far,
I'll break.
On the other hand...
No, there is no other hand.
- No, Chava! No! - But, Papa!
- No!
No!
Golde, here they are.
The boys I told you about.
Wonderful boys from good families.
Each of them a prize, a jewel.
You couldn't do better for your girls.
I don't know, Yente.
My girls are still so young.
So what do they look like, grandfathers?
True, the marriage can wait, but meanwhile, their future will be all signed and sealed.
Which one for which one? What's the difference?
Take your pick.
They're both wonderful boys.
Yankel, the fat one, is apprenticed to a carpenter. - I am Yankel.
- Did I ask you?
Yankel, the skinny one, is...
- Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?
- He's in the barn.
Is there trouble?
Stay inside, children.
What's the matter?
Tevye, have you seen the constable lately? - No.
- There are some rumours in town.
We thought, since you knew him so well, maybe he told you what is true and what is not.
Rumours?
What rumours?
Talk, Avram.
Someone from Zolodin told me an edict issued in St Petersburg...
Welcome, Your Honour.
What's the good news in the world?
I see that you have company.
They are my friends.
It's just as well.
What I have to say is for their ears also.
How much time do you need to sell your house and household goods?
Why should I sell my house?
Is it in anybody's way?
I came to tell you you have to leave Anatevka.
How did I come to deserve such an honour?
Not just you, of course, but all of you.
At first, I thought you might be spared because of your daughter's marriage.
My daughter is dead.
I understand.
At any rate, it affects all of you.
But this corner of the world has always been our home.
- Why should we leave?
- I don't know why.
There's trouble in the world.
- You aren't the only ones.
Your people must leave all the villages - Zolodin, Rabalevka.
The entire district must be emptied.
I have an order here!
It says that you must sell your homes and be out of here in three days.
And you? You, who have known us all your life, you'd carry out this order?
I've nothing to do with it. Don't you understand?
I wish you wouldn't say me.
- I understand.
- Suppose we refuse to go?
- You will be forced out.
- We will defend ourselves.
- We'll stay in our homes.
- We will keep our land and fight.
Against our militia, our army?
I wouldn't advise that.
I have some advice for you.
Get off my land.
This is still my home, my land.
Get off my land.
You have three days.
After a lifetime, a piece of paper, and get thee out.
We should unite with the people of Zolodin. - Maybe they have a plan.
- We should defend ourselves.
- An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
- Very good
That way the whole world will be blind and toothless.
Rabbi, we've been waiting for the Messiah all our lives.
Wouldn't this be a good time for him to come?
We'll have to wait for him someplace else.
Meanwhile, let's start packing.
Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been the Garden of Eden.
That's true.
After all, what have we got here?
~ A little bit of this, a little bit of that ~
~ A pot A pan ~
~ A broom A hat ~
~ Someone should have set a match to this place years ago ~
~ A bench A tree ~
~ What's a house?
Or a stove? ~
People who pass through Anatevka don't even know they've been here.
~ A stick of wood A piece of cloth ~
~ What do we leave? ~
~ Nothing much ~
~ Only Anatevka ~
~ Underfed, overworked Anatevka ~
~ Where else would Sabbath be so sweet?
~ Intimate, obstinate Anatevka ~
~ Where I know everyone I meet ~
~ Soon I'll be a stranger in a strange new place ~
~ Searching for an old familiar face ~ ~ From Anatevka ~
~ I belong to Anatevka ~
~ Tumbledown, workaday Anatevka ~
~ Dear little village ~
~ Little town of mine ~
It's just a place.
Our forefathers have been forced out of many, many places at a moment's notice.
Maybe that's why we always wear our hats.
Golde, darling. I had to see you before I left because I have such news for you.
Remember, yesterday I didn't know where to go, what to do with these old bones. Now I know.
You want to hear?
I'll tell you.
All my life, I've dreamed of going to one place.
Nah, you'll never guess.
Every year at Passover, what do we say?
Next year in Jerusalem.
Next year in the Holy Land.
- You're going to the Holy Land?
- You guessed.
Goodbye, Yente.
And so, goodbye, Golde.
Sometime, maybe we'll meet on a happier occasion.
Meanwhile, we suffer. Oh, we suffer.
We suffer in silence, right?
Of course, right.
Where are you going?
You don't know where you're going?
- Come, Golde, we have to leave.
- Leave.
It sounds so easy.
Golde, we'll all be together soon.
Motel, Tzeitel and the baby, they'll come too, you'll see.
This Motel is a person.
And Hodel and Perchik? When will we ever see them again?
Do they come visiting us from Siberia every Sabbath?
You know what she writes.
He sits in prison, she works. But soon he'll be set free and together they'll turn the world upside down.
She couldn't be happier, and the other children will be with us.
Not all.
All.
Come, Golde.
I have to clean up, sweep the floor.
- Sweep the floor?
- I don't want to leave a dirty house.
Tevye, I am on my way.
Where are you going?
Chicago, in America.
Chicago, America?
We are going to New York, America.
We'll be neighbours.
My wife, Fruma Sarah, has a brother there.
- That's nice.
- I hate him!
But a relative is a relative.
- Goodbye, Tevye.
- Goodbye, Lazar Wolf.
Well, my old friends, it's time to say goodbye.
The farmer Bushenko will be coming for you later.
He's not a bad sort.
If you are good to him, he'll be good to you.
Take care of your leg, huh?
Thanks for everything.
Chava!
- Papa will see you. - I want him to.
I want to say goodbye to him.
- He won't listen to you. - But at least he will hear.
Maybe it would be better if I told Mama.
Chaveleh!
We came to say goodbye.
We are also leaving this place.
We are going to Cracow.
We cannot stay among people who can do such things to others.
We wanted you to know that.
Some are driven away by edicts, others by silence.
Goodbye, Papa.
Mama.
Come, Chava.
Goodbye, Chava... Fyedka.
And God be with you.
- We will write to you in America.
We will be staying with Uncle Avram!
Yes, Mama.
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?" "We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"
The whole world has to know our business.
Stop yelling and finish packing.
We have a long way to go.
Golde, I don't need your advice.
Tzeitel, don't forget the baby.
Goodbye, Papa.
Work hard, Motel, and come to us soon.
I will, Papa.
I'll work hard.
All right, children.
Let's go.
There are unknown facts about the creation of Nature.
An exciting mystery embrace the enormity of the universe.
Unsolved problems hangs over the existence.
Life and death.
And within this whirlwind of lives, just one thing is certain:
the creation of mind and the formation of the substance.
The existence of man.
Now, everything in the universe become easier.
From waters to forests, from Earth to deep space, everything that exist has a reason.
And the man finds a reason to exist.
Nothing born, nothing lives, nothing dies without a reason.
According to the mental ability of everyone, the right answer could take a long or a short time to come,
or come at the exact moment.
But the truth is only one, for everything and for everybody.
if it exists, it must be a reason.
That's why this film exists.
THE END OF MAN
Don't be so sad, Mrs. Rita.
You'll be fine and you'll walk again.
No, my child.
I know that I'll never leave this wheelchair.
Now go, or you'll be late.
Take care and come back soon.
Farewell, Mrs. Rita.
We'll be back soon.
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
A man!
A man!

Mrs. Rita, what's happening?
.
A man!
A man!
But Mrs. Rita, you are walking!
Yes.
I'm walking!
I'm walking!
A miracle!
A miracle!
It happened just like that, Mrs. Maria, as I'm saying to you.
Very well, Mrs. Dinda...
Look, a naked man!
I drink because I'm a good drinker.
I've got a bell inside my head that rings to tell me when I must stop drinking.
The bell just had ringed!
Yes, my love?
Answer me.
My baby, my baby... lt's yours.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Let go my daughter!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I must see my daughter.
I want my daughter.
Let me go!
Let me go!
I want my daughter.
Let me go.
I want my daughter.
My daughter.
I want my daughter.
I want my daughter back.
Let me go!
Quiet!
My daughter!
Ouch!
A charity, please... a charity...
God bless you.
This man must be a lunatic, or even worse: a drug addict.
I didn't do anything.
I simply get my camera and took some pictures.
A very casual thing.
-But the result was disastrous.
-Right.
Suddenly the man gone mad and throws my camera in the lake.
That's all, officer.
And, along with the damages, he attacked me!
-l see. Give orders to search this tramp.
-Yes, chief.
Finis Hominis!
Finis what? .
Finis Hominis!
Gentleman, will you please follow us? .
What's your name?
Finis...
Hominis.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, attention to this news:
A mysterious man escaped after he was imprisoned by two policemen.
Nobody knows who is this very strange man, as also is strange the clothes he wears.
And that's all by now.
We'll be back tomorrow with another News at Night.
Until tomorrow.
Gentleman, you didn't pay the bill.
-What bill?
-The food you ate.
Why pay? .
Because everything you ate we also must pay.
So, don't pay anybody and it will be no problem.
Here's your order.
We'll deliver your package tomorrow, okay?
.
Thank you.
You should see what a strange man.
When the waiter tried to charge the bill, the man answered that he wouldn't pay. And left leaving everybody surprised.
I'm not sure, but I believe that I've already heard about this man.
Yes? .
Who is it? .
Count Maximiliano?
If we have room?
Yes, yes, sure.
We'll be awaiting.
Sure. Bye.
Thank you.
Hush, my baby. You'll be fine, my child.
Hush.
Mommy's here with you, my little angel.
Hush.
My God, hush, baby, you'll be fine.
Calm down.
Could the doctors take care of the girl now?
.
The child is getting worse.
I've already told you that the doctors are busy.
If you can't wait, take her to another hospital.
My God, this girl will die soon!
Turn around.
Say 33.
33.
-Repeat.
-33.
...Gentil intercepts with his left foot and passes to Júlio... passes to Plínio, Plínio to Caíco, Caíco controls it... crosses the dividing line of the field... and there goes the red team for the attack... again with Plínio, he passes one, two... controls the ball, enters in the box... attention, he prepares the kick, goes to kick...
My child, soon the doctors will take care of you.
Please, be calm, don't worry.
You'll be fine.
I can't take it, what can I do?
I can't wait any longer.
That's enough, it can't be, can't be. The doctors must see her.
I don't know, he's a very strange man.
He goes upstairs carrying the girl in his arms.
What a strange man, who could he be?
He must be the principal of this hospital.
He came to watch our work.
Say 33.
-One more time.
-33.
-Again.
-33.
-Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
-l'll be back soon!
Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
Attention, attention, doctors and nurses...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Urgent call to General Surgery...
Come, quick, it must be important.
You´ve got to do everything to save this girl.
We can't fail.
Give it all you've got.
This girl must be saved.
But this child is a proletarian.
Remember that we don't know who's that man with the girl.
We need to keep the reputation of this hospital.
-Let's go to the surgery room.
-We've gotta prove that we're the best.
The girl is alive.
Where's that man?
We know how great is the interest on the strange man... who wanders in the streets of our city.
An information that just arrived says that yesterday... a strange act saved the life of a child who was in great agony.
One also knows that this man is the same that... appeared completely undressed a few days ago in the beach of Santos... and that, as they say, is miraculous.
Most peculiar is that he appears and disappears unexpectedly.
Wait for tomorrow other news on this case.
And now, back to our program.
Soft!
Delicious!
You know, they ask me why I spend all my money.
If I got it... right?
.
Sure, darling!
Give daddy a kiss.
Angel, I'm crazy.
Make those things only you know how to do.
I'll do anything you ask me to.
My life!
I'm yours.
My baby.
Your wife are in bed with another man.
No, it can't be. lt's not possible.
Tell it to my father and to all my family.
Tonight she'll meet a real macho man.
-Excuse me.
-What's this...?
You-you sl... slut!
Leave me alone!
Dirty bitch, you'll pay for that!
My father, the blood of this slut will wash the honor of ourfamily.
Adulteress!
Adulteress!
Shameless whore!
Dirty bitch!
Street whore!
Get her! Get her! Get this shameless woman.
The man must stop when he doesn't have any reason to continue.
Please, save me!
Don't be afraid.
No one will hurtyou any more.
I don't need any explanation.
I know the truth.
You... did you tell your father about your affairs? .
Your husband, he really knows who you are?
And you... did you tell her about your affairs?
.
If somebody must be punished, then everyone must punish itself and the forgive will come.
Finis Hominis Saves Adulteress from Lynch Mob!
And now, sweethearts, let's make love.
It's a masterpiece!
Great!
Hurrah!
Only Finis could do better than this magical touch.
How is it going, Valdomiro, you still haven't found that so-called prophet? .
There he comes.
People, we've found the man.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
We've gotta prepare a big reception for tomorrow.
Yeah!
Yeah!
And couldn't be us a big reception?
But we must give our best and not be a deception!
You can leave it to me because I can handle with this!
And count with me too.
We gotta please the man.
Starting tomorrow, hippies will have a master.
Finis Hominis!
Finis Hominis!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh!
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eya-eh...
Here begins the New World!
Our world!
Finis Hominis, you're the man!
We are all men.
The birds lives and the children are dressed with the best fabric!
Freedom, freedom, and hurrah to free love!
Shall we love one another!
The master taught us, but mankind has got away from him!
The struggle, before anything else, is for survival!
We search for the truth.
And what else is true, besides money?
.
Here is the man.
Master, these women are for you.
We're searching for the Paradise Lost.
While we're awaiting for the truth.
Everybody naked, yeah!
Everybody naked, yeah!

STOP!
That's enough!
Enough!
Peace!
Love!
Freedom!
And money?
.
More money.
Money, money.
Come on, sister, all this money is ours.
This money is mine!
Did you see a very strange looking man, wearing a turban?
-Who, the prophet of peace?
-Yes.
He´s gonna away.
Come get the money he gave to us.
Come on, come on.
No, thank you, I can't.
I must go look for him.
The sales declined a little this month.
We need to launch a new advertising campaign urgently.
But we can't launch an ordinary campaign.
We need something different.
I think I found the solution:
Finis Hominis.
Butwe don't know who is he.
It doesn't matter.
He's the man of the moment.
And as had said Our Lord Jesus Christ, ""l'll be back for thy".
Yes, brothers, he'd came back to reign again!
Yes, brothers, he'd came back because it was written so.
He'd came back for the salvation of all mankind.
My brothers, he's the only hope that reign over thy.
My brothers, he's among us, and within him there's a hope for all mankind.
Hurrah to Finis Hominis!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Good morning. Did you sleep well?
Are you already awake?
Yes.
Darling, I brought your breakfast.
But it's so early...
Did you forgot that I'll travel today? .
Oh, yes!
And how long you'll be away from me?
No more than two or three days.
But don't you worry.
If anything happens, you tell somebody to look for me.
Take care, my baby.
I don't want you to miss anything, otherwise I'll be the one who'll be worried.
When I come back, I'll have a pleasant surprise for you!
But I'll miss you so much...
But don't you worry.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be back soon. Take care, my darling.
Okay. Bye!
Tony, take me to the airport.
Let's go.
Oh, oh!
Come here, you dirty bitch!
It's for things like this that I have to see you married with him?
What have I done?
""Bye-bye!"...
You bitch!
Take it!
Take it!
Take it!
...
Slut!
That's enough!
Stop it or you'll kill this woman!
Not quite, mom.
She's already used to this.
And Cavalcanti?
Tony is driving him to the airport.
You cretin, what were you doing... that you didn't give him the poison, huh?
I was asleep.
Like I said before, this stupid girl will serve us for nothing.
But, since yesterday, you didn't do anything with me.
Well, this doesn't matter now.
I'll take her to the room.
We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? .
But, in the present situation, we can't do any better.
Wind from the sea and my face under the sun, so warm,
Streets full of people who pass and see me passing by,
Rio de Janeiro, I love you, I like everybody who likes,
This sky, this sea, this happy people, I sure tried to write a love poem,
Love was in everything that I saw, ln everything that I ever loved...
Enough!
Enough!
That's enough!
Baby...
You promised.
This crying is annoying me!
Everybody got its own madness.
This is beyond madness, it's real masochism!
There's nothing we can do.
We need her collaboration.
-And so?
-Normal.
Those cataleptic seizures was caused by emotional shocks.
Fortunately they're not fatal.
-Paulo...
-There's no reason to be panic.
And what about the other problem?
Don't worry.
The impotence will disappear during the medical treatment.
I'm in a total despair.
I want to be cured soon.
My wife...
You don't know her.
She's a healthful girl.
She needs me.
I understand.
Within the next days... will arrive a package with foreign medicines... that are perfect in your case.
I'll send you some of these medicine.
For the time being, you can take this one. It'll help you a lot.
I'll be waiting for the medicine.
Thank you very much.
No problem. Friends are also for the difficult moments.
Yeah, the girl got his share of happiness.
Okay, the doll is already happy.
Come on, let's go to the business.
The inheritance of our beloved uncle.
We got to find a way, before he returns.
But how?
.
I already know how.
Calm down, calm down...
""...hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,"
""Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven..."
Poor Mr. Cavalcanti.
Only the good die young, what can we do?
That's life.
Did you see her behavior?
.
It's getting suspicious.
Pedro, tell Mário that the girl isn't crying.
People are getting suspicious.
Tell him that Soninha must cry.
You must do something to that girl.
It can be hard.
I've got an idea.
Come with me. Cover me.
You cretin!
You must cry.
Baby, you know what to do.
""...and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil..."
""Our father, which art in heaven:
hallowed be Thy name,"
""Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven..."
""Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we..."
Not there!
My baby, you can't leave me...
My darling, don't leave me, don't leave me!
I can't live without you!
Don't leave me, darling!
Don't leave me!
She loved him so much!
It's a beautiful love!
How did he get it? .
I don't know.
What's matter now is that she's crying.
Yes.
Let's close the casket.
Are you sure that he's really dead?
.
Dead or alive, we'll burry him anyway.
That man isn't dead yet.
He'll arise to continue his existence until the moment of his final day.
Rise, Cavalcanti, to do the best for those who want you dead.
And that my intervention serves as an example to what doesn't have to come, and that your life continues, as intentionally is.
No!
No!
Extra!
Extra!
Finis recreate a scene from two thousand years ago!
Millionaire disinherits his family and his fortune goes for charity institutions!
Civil Guard, São Paulo
We've already got the most important:
the permit to present the show.
Well, I was expecting for this.
After all, the money will go to the corporation hospital.
The show is scheduled for tomorrow night and we still searching for the cast.
I was afraid this could happen.
And what can we do now?
.
Guys, the problem is over.
I've already found an actor.
But only one actor?
.
One actor worth of twenty.
Now it doesn't matter.
What we got to do is to hold that man.
You can be sure that the man is already with us.
-Here are the artist.
-Very well.
Do you want to see our installations?
.
We can think about it later.
What's matter now is the show.
Money is the main problem.
Money for people who are in need.
So, let's the money.
And after that... the show. Right?
.
-Yeah, he's right.
-Yes, it's a fact.
Thank you.
More.
Come on, you don't have to be shame.
It'sjust a contribution.
Well, I won't give any money, but I can give another hat.
Thank you.
Thirty million.
Good.
Very good!
Close the curtains, because what you'll see now... is something nobody ever saw.
Things gone bad, the man gone away.
-Give them an explanation...
-Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the show won't be presented, because, we don't know why, our actor disappeared.
Or, in fact, he vanished.
-Oh, yes?
. -But vanished how? .
It's impossible!
The guy must appear.
It's ridiculous!
Where's the responsibility of the organization of the show? .
It's so ridiculous.
This is so absurd!
I'll talk with the manager!
Why such a rebellion?
The real show was that we've justwatched.
That trick was of bad taste, huh?
Wait. he money is for the corporation hospital, right?
-Yes.
-Well, we've already got money enough.
-The show doesn't matter.
-Our main mission is completed.
Please, sir, I'm looking for the prophet of peace.
I was told that he's around here.
I don't know.
I'm also looking for him.
Perhaps that policeman could help us.
He's close to our town and soon he'll be here.
God listened to our prayers.
He sent His emissary to save the world.
Yes, sisters.
Finis came to save the world.
Let's pray to thank God.
Attention!
Attention!
Attention!
Attention!
Authorities must take action.
A man shakes the nation.
He's a deranged man who, although he hasn't attacked defenseless people,
he got a supernatural power greater than that of the authorities.
Attention!
Attention!
Hold that man who, although his peaceful look, represents a great danger.
He's the promised messiah!
I am... an... instrument.
He's the right way.
The truth is in everyone.
He came from a distant planet.
I'm an ordinary human being.
He's the salvation of mankind.
The salvation of each country is in the cooperation of its own people.
And now attention, ladies and gentlemen, for the latest news.
Finis Hominis, the strange man who everybody knows... and that's believed by many as the messiah,
had announced his departure from our town tomorrow.
Millions of people are awaiting for his farewell speech, in the hope to know his origin, his mission and his destination.
That's all for the moment.
Good night.
Centuries goes by, millenniuns goes by.
Everything repeats in the elapsing of eternity.
As I promised, I'm here to bid you farewell.
Because it's approaching the hour when I must leave, to fulfill my mission.
But what was said will last forever.
In the Book of Truth is written the fate of the universe.
Hundreds, thousands, millions of men are listening to me in this moment... knowing that these words are the hope for a better world.
The man carry on his shoulders... the weight of the fate of his own reason to be.
He's blindly searching for the reason of his existence.
When, in his hypocrisy, he runs away from the truth... to hide itself under the shroud of lie.
The man must take care... of his ambition and his disbelief.
Because if this won't happen, it'll be the end of man.
This broadcast will beat all of our ratings records.
The mankind holds itself to the belief, waiting in faith for the miracle,
while the only true miracle is the existence of mankind.
The struggle for wealth is untiring, and the despite for poverty is absolute,
without knowing what's wealth and what's poverty.
When the man looks inside himself and focus his mind in what he sees, in this very moment he'll understand the reason of his origin and his existence.
And a scream of triumph will blast out from his mouth.
It's not possible. I've already asked for a zoom, what are they waiting for?
.
Because the man will finally know the reason to be.
Together with justice, faith and the glorious virtue of love.
It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, the way this man is able to transmit to mankind his message of faith.
It's written that peace will reign for all eternity... and a kingdom of happiness will be build with forces of good.
Today, thanks to the privilege of television, you can watch inside your own homes... the farewell of a man who now lives in the heart of us all.
Wherever you are, I'll be with you!
My destiny is to follow you!
To the place where l'm going, nobody could follow me.
Master, I've got nothing else!
I've left all behind just to follow you.
You've left everything behind because you wanted to... according to your free will.
Your instinct pushed you to go.
That woman who now is by your side... wouldn't be that one you always been searching? .
Your instinct wouldn't have lead you to search for the man who now stands close to you?
.
He's coming.
I told you. He always comes back.
São Cristovão Sanatorium, Nervous illnesses lf it exists, there must be a reason for it.
THE END
Oh, Finn, you gave me a fright.
I was afraid it was Uncle Toby, and I hadn't got his supper ready.
I'll get the supper, Derval, while you milk the cow.
What cow?
This cow.
Whose cow is it?
Granny's.
It's Granny!
She has a house in Ireland.
Remember the house?
It had a funny roof.
Like this?
Can I touch it?
It's yours.
I made it in woodwork class.
I copied it from that old postcard what Granny sent.
Remember?
The door works.
Look inside.
Furniture.
Turn the house around.
There's a huge bed.
That's Granny's.
It must be wonderful to live in Ireland.
Ireland, Ireland.
Always going on about Ireland.
What about my supper?
You're home early, Uncle Toby.
I come home when it suits me.
Derval, I don't permit your things underfoot.
I like things tidy.
So put this rubbish in the fire, please.
It's not rubbish, it's a model of Granny's house.
"Granny's house."
In the fire, Derval.
Derval, I'm talking to you.
Answer me!
She can't speak when she's upset.
You know that.
Then don't talk, girl.
Just put this in the fire.
I'll do it.
Derval can do it.
You've got supper to get.
Get it all!
I like a tidy house.
And you can stop that, or I'll belt you one!
Did you hear me?
Leave her alone!
You've a lot to learn, boy.
Just don't touch Derval.
There's reform schools for bad ones like you.
What do you think, Derval?
Shall I put your brother in a reform school?
It's Mary O'Flaherty!
What you be having, Mary?
I'll be having justice!
Where's Judge Liffy?
He's above.
I'll see him there, then.
The court's in session, Mary, you can't be interrupting His Honour.
Can't I, now?
MAN: Lord save us...
I am the last man to catch a fish out of season, Your Honour.
Poaching is unlawful.
LIFFY: The salmon was found in your creel, Danny.
The founding I will admit, Your Honour, but the catching was none of my doing.
Explain that.
I found the poor fish, Your Honour, lying on the bank of the stream.
As God is my judge!
Well, for the time being, this judge passes sentence.
Ten days with costs.
Order!
Next case!
Never mind the next case, Brendan!
I have here a letter of importance.
I'll talk with you after court, Mary O'Flaherty.
So I have to wait and listen to the long lies of poachers and after-hour drinkers?
And all the while, my small grandchildren...
You're interrupting the business of the court, Mrs. O'Flaherty.
We don't mind interruption, Your Honour.
Do we, boys?
CROWD: No!
If the court had done its business properly in the first place, my grandchildren would be here safe with me now.
It was an English court granted custody to their stepfather, making him their legal guardian.
Then what's he done with them?
It says right here in the letter, "My grandchildren are missing in England..."
MAN: Missing in England?
Read the letter.
Let me see, let me see. Mm-hm.
"We are attempting to locate one Finn Dove, male, 13, and one Derval Dove, female, 7."
I don't need the letter read to me.
What I need is the legality, the legal gist, you might say.
"The issues of the late Terence Dove and his wife Maureen O'Flaherty Dove..."
My daughter, God rest her soul.
She had the O'Flaherty kidneys.
"It is known that Mrs. Dove remarried one Tobias Cromwell."
CROWD: Cromwell?
Order!
"Any information you might give regarding Mr. Cromwell or Finn and Derval Dove would be appreciated.
The children are the principal beneficiaries to a trust from their grandfather Dove amounting to the annual sum of $10,000 each."
"If the children are not found or are deceased..."
Heaven forbid!
"...the estate will pass to their uncle, John Cyril Dove, better known as Hawk Dove."
Ladies and gentlemen, for our final act, we present that master of disguise, Mr. Impossible, Hawk Dove.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Dr. Jekyll.
I will now conduct a little experiment.
People of nervous disposition are advised to leave now, while there's still time!
Sodium carbonate.
Carbon tetrachloride.
Sodium tetrachloride.
Sodium carbon.
Carbon... sodium... carbonate.
Pardon.
Where was I?
Who am I?
Oh, yes!
My name is Dr. Jekyll!
[IN LOW VOICE] My name is Mr. Hyde.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You only see one body,
[IN LOW VOICE] But it's both of us inside.
Both of us inside.
[YELLING] It's both of us inside!
Why doesn't somebody listen?
Well, that's it!
I've had enough of your tantrums.
They wouldn't even listen.
Didn't give me a chance.
What do they want, blood?
I know what I want.
I want you out of here as fast as you can pack!
That was a filthy thing to do on anyone.
I said, I wanted you out...
Nobody does that to Hawk Dove!
Nobody!
If you are not out in 5 minutes, I shall call the police!
I go when I get my money.
After I've deducted for breakages, there'll be no money, Mr. Impossible!
You!
My God, you're choking me.
It should've come to... me.
"Annual sum of $10,000 each."
It's mine!
"If the children are not found or are deceased, the estate will pass to..."
Among your patrons, do you number a certain Tobias Cromwell?
Draw one for Cromwell.
There you are, sir.
Thank you.
You are Tobias Cromwell?
I might be.
Why?
You have a boy named Finn and a girl named Derval?
I'm their stepfather.
Are you from child welfare?
No, Mr. Cromwell.
My name is Maxwell Purdon.
Well, I don't need a solicitor.
You will, Mr. Cromwell, you will.
To help you count the money.
What money?
If they catch us running away, will they send you to reform school?
Nobody's gonna separate us, Derval.
There's no more room.
Well, wear as many things as you can.
Did you get the money from your bank?
Yes.
Running away is fun.
My teddy bear!
Derval, we have to pack all the food we can.
Can't I take anything useful?
How about that?
DERVAL: Are we really going to Granny's?
Yes.
We just want the page with the map of Ireland on it.
Who takes care of the money, then, till they come of age?
You do, Mr. Cromwell.
You are their legal guardian.
Oh, yes.
But I always think of them as my own children.
Of course, Mr. Cromwell, of course.
CROMWELL: Oh, they've left the light on, little rascals.
Duck!
I'm afraid I must insist on seeing them.
By the terms of the will, if the children cannot be found, the money passes to their uncle.
Hawk Dove?
That is his stage name.
Amusing contradiction in terms, "hawk," "dove."
Well, he has this hawk, you see, tattooed on his wrist.
He calls himself Mr. Impossible.
Does himself up in all kinds of disguises.
How very original.
A terrible actor.
Indeed?
I understand he has considerable talent, actually.
Terrible temper.
He almost killed a man once.
Yes.
The children, Mr. Cromwell?
I'll go and fetch them.
It's Uncle Toby!
Wake up, Finn. Wake up, Derval.
Ah, they played too hard, the darlings.
[MENACINGLY] It's Uncle Toby, children!
They've gone!
They're not there!
Where could they have gone to?
Hey, what's that?
Geography book.
With a page torn out.
Page 13...
Ireland.
Ireland.
Are we going back to Uncle Toby's?
No, we're getting on the boat.
Kidnapped?
By their Irish grandmother.
She'd do anything, you know, to get her hands on...
Get her hands on what?
On the, uh, children.
Children, inspector, the children.
The old lady, it appears, cannot accept the fact that Mr. Cromwell was appointed their guardian.
Never mention money.
It confuses the police mind.
What do you expect the police to do, Mr. Cromwell?
Find my children, of course, inspector.
But they're not lost.
You said their grandmother had taken them to Ireland.
She had no right.
I love those kids.
I give them a good home.
They're happy with me.
And I want them back!
I'm sure you do, but it's not a police matter. What you need is a solicitor.
I am his solicitor.
I can have the children declared wards of the court.
INSPECTOR: Well, in that case, soon as an Irish court issues a warrant, their police can recover the children.
I'll notify the Irish Gardai.
The Irish police?
Do you think they can find my children?
They're very efficient, Mr. Cromwell.
Oh, I'd feel safer if they was in English hands.
I'd send a man over to cooperate if I weren't so short-handed.
We've two men on sick leave and my top inspector going on holiday.
CROMWELL: Are these children to be left to their fate because some cop's up on holiday?
Inspector, my children must be found.
Mr. Purdon?
I shall fly to Dublin myself.
Splendid idea.
I shall await your instructions here, Mr. Cromwell.
Um, I shall arrange a court order for both England and Ireland.
Goodbye.
I shall worry about your children.
FINN: Come on.
MAN [OVER PA]: Passengers for the Dublin boat, queue to your left:
We will be boarding immediately:
Harold, you take your brother's hand.
Now, children, will you all please try and stay together?
Come on.
Never mind the children, have we got all the bags?
There's a strong lad.
Now, move along, there.
Come along, lad.
MAN: All up the line, please!
You won't get there any quicker, lad.
Oh, Maisy, I told you I've got the ticket.
Now, stop fussing!
Is your bag heavy?
It has my hand broke.
Well, it's got two handles.
We can both carry it.
Where's your own bag?
Is that all?
You're lucky.
Are you going to Ireland on holiday?
That's right.
We go there every year.
And every year, the bags get heavier.
MAN: Step forward, please!
Have your tickets ready!
Thank you very much.
Tickets, please.
Hello.
Hello, then.
Hi, Peter. Every time you come over, you've more and more children!
Somebody has to make up for bachelors like you!
How many?
Don't you know how to count?
Peter, the baby's tired.
I could've sworn there were more.
Hurry up!
All right, all right, move along.
Have a nice trip, Peter.
Bye-bye.
Tickets, please.
Thank you.
Why do they have such funny signs?
They spell things in Gaelic and English both.
What's Gaelic?
That's Irish.
What's Irish?
Gaelic.
Oh, it doesn't make sense.
Come on, Derval.
Hold it!
No marks on your bags.
Where's your people?
Parents are back there?
Well...
Are you carrying any smuggled goods?
Well, I suppose you haven't broken any law.
All right, be off!
You've arrived on the proper day.
Oh?
It's St. Patrick's Day.
Welcome to Ireland.
Mr. Cromwell to speak to you.
Mr. Cromwell?
Yes.
Detective Inspector Rourke, Irish Gardai.
Oh, the police?
Well, have you found my children yet?
Oh, we've just got started, Mr. Cromwell, but we should settle the case fairly quickly.
You in charge of this case, then?
Which case?
The missing kids.
I could be.
Who are you?
I could be Detective Chief Inspector Walcott, Liverpool Crime Squad.
Oh, did the chief inspector send you?
I'm here on holiday.
He requested me to offer my services in case you might want help.
That'd be very generous of you, but I think I'll be able to handle the case myself.
Let him help, inspector.
Oh, it is extremely fortunate having you here, sir.
It's up to you, Rourke.
Frankly, I'd just as soon get on with my fishing.
Well, I'd hate to interfere with that.
After all, it's just a routine chase.
Routine?
Listen, lad!
If those were your two kids out there, maybe hungry, maybe cold, maybe suffocating in some bog or kidnapped by some psychopath, and you don't know they're not, would you still think it was routine?
You're damn right you wouldn't.
Mr. Cromwell, we'd like a few remarks for our viewers.
Do you still accuse Mary O'Flaherty of kidnapping the children?
I do.
Is that what the English police think too?
All I'm interested in, gentlemen, is finding my children.
Well, how can we find Mary O'Flaherty?
She lives in County Galway.
They're must be dozens of Mary O'Flahertys in County Galway!
Only one kidnapped my children.
Why would the kids' own granny take the kids?
Didn't she like the way you raised them?
I resent that, sir! I gave Finn and Derval a wonderful home.
Then what are we doing here?
Get organised! Cover the main roads, bus stations, rail terminals.
Come on!
Where's your headquarters?
What are you waiting for now?
REPORTER: Mr. Cromwell, I see you have a prepared statement.
Would you like to read it for our audience?
"I am the broken-hearted stepfather and legal guardian of Finn and Derval Dove.
In order to obtain any information that might lead to the children being found or the kidnappers punished,
I am offering a reward of £100."
The first Cromwell slaughtered the Irish.
This one'll talk them to death.
"And I would lik e your viewers to know I wish that was £10, 000, for that is what Finn and Derval mean to me:"
£10,000!
It's their $10,000 he's after!
Let Cromwell show his face here, and I'll give him his reward.
Only a Cromwell could kidnap an innocent Irish child.
For the love of God, Paddy!
It's not Cromwell that's kidnapped them, he says, it's myself!
And who has a better right to kidnap her own grandchildren than their grandmother?
But I didn't do it!
Ah, that's the telly for you.
Fearful lot of liars, all of them!
You ought to sue them, Mary.
It's not a lawsuit I'm after.
I want my grandchildren.
And I've a few things to say to the people on the telly concerning themselves and the lies of Tobias Cromwell and the insinuation that I am not the only
Mary Magdalene St. Bridget O'Flaherty in County Galway!
DERVAL: I'm hungry.
FINN: We're runaways.
Runaways have to put up with a lot of things they don't like.
And gotta be brave.
Will you hurry along there?
We're closing down for Patrick's Day parade.
How much are the pork pies?
10 pence each.
We haven't got enough.
SELLER: Ah, there you are.
One.
Come back here!
Come back, I tell you!
Come back here!
God, mister, you couldn't take your eye off them!
Come back here, I tell you!
Finn Dove, you stole!
Never mind.
We'll send the money when we get to Granny's.
MAN [ON TV]: Occasional showers spreading from the south-west during the next 48 hours:
Police are on the look out for two children, Finn and Derval Dove, aged 13 and 7, missing from home since last night:
The Dove children's legal guardian, Mr: Tobias Cromwell, has requested that anyone knowing the whereabouts of these children should contact their nearest Garda station:
Mr: Cromwell has offered a reward of £100 for information leading to their recovery:
The boy, Finn, has reddish ginger hair, and his sister, Derval, has long blond hair:
GARDA: Excuse me, did you see a couple of kiddies come in here?
- In the vicinity of the boat-train station, Liverpool:
There are allegations of kidnapping, but so far, no evidence: : :
MAN: Is that them?
Hey there!
He's eating my stolen pies!
You thief!
Good day to you, Rabbi.
Put your hat on, Garda.
This is a house of worship.
Excuse me, Rabbi, but I'm looking for a couple of kiddies.
Oh, well, we've plenty of those, you know.
Not your kiddies, Rabbi.
These are a couple of missing children.
I just saw them come in a moment ago.
I'm sure I did.
Missing children?
Well, if there are any missing children here, you're more than welcome to interrogate them... as they are passing outside.
Come on, sit down.
Sit down.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Now, tell me... what crime have you committed with all the police after you?
Well, we were hungry, so I stole some pork pies.
Pork!
Hunger is not a crime.
Nor should it be the cause of it.
This requires a Solomon-like decision.
Now, the next time you're hungry, try the chicken!
That was a nice priest.
He wasn't a priest, he was a rabbi.
Anyway, it was a nice church.
It wasn't a church, it was a synagogue.
What's a "synamagob"?
Oh. Kind of a church.
There you go talking garlic again.
Look!
It's a great day for the Irish.
I'm not Irish.
You don't have to be Irish to be Irish.
[ALL SINGING "YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IRISH TO BE IRISH"]
DERVAL: What are we going to do now?
FINN: We gotta get out of Dublin.
DERVAL:
Finn? I left my coat in the synamagob.
I hope I don't lose any more clothes. FINN:
Mm.
Whoa!
Do you want a ride?
Yes, sir!
We've been walking for hours.
Hop on. DERVAL:
Thank you very, very much.
FINN: Up you go.
By accent, I'd say you were English. That's right.
You're lucky I happened along.
It's not what you might cal a well-travelled road.
Been to Dublin, have you?
We passed through.
Are you from Dublin?
I am and I amn't.
My bits of business takes me in and out.
Right now, I'm on the way to Laraford.
Is that near County Galway?
Oh, going west to Galway, is it?
No, Kildare.
She gets mixed up.
Shh!
Uh?
You have people there?
Kildare, that is.
Yeah, we got a lot of cousins there.
Why didn't you ring your relatives?
Uh, my Aunt Mabel doesn't have a telephone.
Maybe she's waiting for you at the station.
Oh, no.
She...
She didn't make a definite date.
She just said to phone when we get there.
And there's no phone, you said?
No, the people next door do.
Ah.
Why didn't you ring them?
I lost the number.
How did the English ever think they'd beat the Irish?
10 hours, and all I've heard is Irish blarney!
Don't you people ever move?
We can move fast enough when we're ready, Mr. Walcott.
There's no point in chasing wild geese.
Whoa.
That was a thirsty drive.
You sit here.
I'll go and have a pint of Guinness.
And I'll bring you a lemonade each.
The weather's about to change.
How can you tell, Mr. Mickser?
Ah, it's my tattoo.
It always itches when the weather's about to change.
[WHISPERS LOUDLY] Tattoo?
You sit here, and I'll show you my tattoo when I come back.
It's Uncle Hawk!
Come on, Derval, run!
DERVAL: Finn, I left my sweater in Mickser's cart.
Hello?
Hello.
Is that the Gardai?
Yes, well, it's about the reward for the missing children.
What missing children?
Sure, it was on the telly in Dublin this morning.
And it's in the newspapers.
The Laraford Arms?
Right.
Hold on to them till I get there.
What's the matter?
I've hurt my ankle.
Come on!
Finn, you're stealing again!
We're only borrowing it.
Get on.
FINN: Hurry up.
Okay? DERVAL:
Yes.
Rourke.
Yes?
Very good.
Good.
Right, I'll deal with it.
Thank you.
Well?
Our best lead yet.
That was the constable of Laraford.
The kids have been spotted.
Where's Laraford?
Laraford's on the way to Galway.
Now, to get to Galway, the kids have got to have to cross the Shannon at Athlone or Shannon Bridge.
What are you doing now?
I'm going to order Athlone to cover the Shannon Bridge.
Why not cover both?
My men will get them.
I see.
And you'll sit here in Dublin?
Let the kids go across the Shannon while some bog-trotting copper dozes in the sun?
We've got them cornered now.
Why don't you get on with your holiday, Walcott.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure, as long as the kids are safe.
The man said he had the kids.
The man?
What man?
The man who phoned the constable at Laraford to claim the reward.
Did the constable give a description of the man?
What man?
The man with the kids!
They could be in great danger!
Well, as soon as I phone Athlone, I'll be driving out there myself.
I'll be glad to give you a lift, inspector.
Great idea.
How did it occur to you?
Come on, roundhead, wake up!
Found the kidnapper yet?
FINN: Here's a good place.
DERVAL: It's a bit scary.
It's all right, Derval.
It's an old church or something.
DERVAL: It's a graveyard.
FINN: We've gotta sleep somewhere.
DERVAL: Not forever.
FINN: Here's a kind of a cave, under this rock.
It's dry, we can sleep here.
FINN: Lie down and use this for a pillow.
Finn?
If Uncle Hawk was Mummy's brother, why didn't she like him?
Because he had a tattoo?
No, he was our father's half-brother.
Nobody liked him.
Finn?
What's a half-brother? Derval!
Go to sleep!
MAN: Open the grave.
MAN: Open the grave, I said!
Well, I thought you'd never come.
There's plenty of them down here, but you'd better hurry.
Hey, now, that's the way to raise the spirits!
Ha-ha!
MAN 2: Will you shut up, Mulligan?
You're waking even the dead ones!
MAN: You know why they build fences around graveyards, don't you?
MULLIGAN: Because people are dying to get in!
Hurry it up, fellas!
You've a long drive to Galway.
FINN [IN HUSHED VOICE]: The van's going to Galway.
Come on.
MULLIGAN: All right, that's the lot.
Well, now, there's the little question of hard cash.
MICKSER: Well, it better be better than the last stuff.
You know, there's poitin and there's poitin.
MULLIGAN: Mine is the best in Ireland, Mickser, you know that.
Mickser?
Uncle Hawk.
MICKSER: Hello.
I can get a couple of pounds for that.
Aye, it might come in handy if that old van of yours breaks down, Mickser.
Aye, and there's times you might make more... smuggling kids.
MICKSER: Night, boys! MAN:
Safe journey.
Don't drink it all yourself!
What have I done now, Garda?
You will drive me to Athlone.
My van's a slow poke.
Faster than walking!
I think it's a policeman.
It's a right state of affairs when a Garda should be having to hitch a ride.
They could've furnished you with a bike at least.
They did.
It was stolen yesterday from my own front gate.
Aye.
There's more than that going on.
Them English kids that's missing, they were seen in Laraford last night.
Wh...?
What kids?
A boy, 12, ginger hair, and a fair-haired girl that's 7 in a scarlet sweater.
There's a reward of £100.
I'll be claiming that.
That £100 is mine.
It was me made the phone call.
It'll be my information that led to their capture.
That reward'll be mine.
Well, suppose the children turn up someplace other than Laraford? Athlone, for instance?
Highly unlikely.
Oh, now, it's hard to know these things.
We'll see.
ROURKE: I want you to be alert, men.
Examine every car.
And don't be afraid to ask questions.
Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
There's a man on every bridge across the Shannon, is there?
Excuse me, sir, but aren't you overdoing it a little?
How do you mean?
It's not exactly The Great Train Robbery:
I claim the £100 reward.
'Twas me reported the lost kids!
He can't do that, sergeant, that reward is mine.
Here, calm down, the both of you.
If you've got a hand in this, Mickser, then there's something fishy.
You know this man, sergeant? Don't I, sir?
Smuggler, liar and no good.
I wouldn't trust the word of Mickser if he said that he had the kids in the back of his van.
Suppose you tell us where they are, Mickser.
It's a pleasure to talk to a man in authority such as yourself, sir.
Go to the top if you want anything done.
We want the children.
Well, now, there's a little matter of some money...
Where are those kids?
If you lie, you will be charged with kidnapping, perjury and obstructing a police officer!
Kidnapping!
Take it easy, Walcott.
I know how to handle his kind!
I'm in charge of this case still.
If I knew where they were, I'd tell them to hide!
And let's see what you've got in here, shall we, Mickser?
And just in case we find any poitin in there, we'll be giving you a reward, sure enough!
Hello!
What's this?
It's my bike.
I meant to tell you about that, but it slipped my mind.
I found it lying alongside the road.
Ah-ha!
The missing kids.
ROURKE: No, the missing boy has red hair, the girl's fair.
SERGEANT: These are two boys.
MICKSER: A couple of tinker kids, stealing rides like ticks on a sheepdog.
I warned you to keep away from my van.
Now, be off with you!
Go on!
Make tracks!
Oi!
What's all the delay?
ROURKE: We thought for a moment we'd just found the children, Mr. Cromwell.
Tinker kids!
Mr. Cromwell!
You lying scoundrel!
You knew all along.
Ah, it was worth it to see them kids give you the slip.
There they go!
Where?
Round the corner.
HAWK: Get those silly moos out of the way, you great Irish cowboy!
Let me down!
FINN DERVAL:
Ha-ha! HAWK: Oh, you tinker, you!
You wait till I get hold of you!
Come back!
I won't hurt you!
Let me down, now, will you?
!
Shh!
Shh!
[WHISPERING] Derval, shut those pigs up.
MAN:
Hey! Wait for me!
Excuse me.
Oi!
You should've had them.
Where's Walcott?
Here he comes now.
You just had us down that side street.
Why'd you go off in the opposite direction?
To cut them off, of course, in case they double back.
Well, they couldn't double back.
That street goes in another direction.
How should I know that?
Anyway, you've got them covered now, so it's just routine isn't it?
I can leave the rest to you, can't I?
Oh, no.
No. Mr. Walcott!
I'm going fishing.
Good luck, Rourke.
Well, what are we going to do now?
You're familiar with this case.
I want you assigned to it exclusively.
Speak to your superiors about it.
Let me have your name and number.
It's Pat Flynn, 864, sir.
Inspector Rourke here.
I want you to run a check on Chief Inspector Walcott, Liverpool Crime Squad.
Description, whereabouts, everything.
This'll do very nicely, thanks.
Those pigs were pigs.
They drank all that milk.
We'll find something to eat.
Here, how do you like me as a blond?
I didn't mind you cutting my hair, but that stove polish smelt awful.
Could we claim the reward money, Finn?
But what sense would that make?
If we had £100, we wouldn't have to be hungry.
Derval, I told you, you've got to be brave.
I am brave, but my stomach's not.
I wish we could eat grass.
Well, we can't have a ride in a van, how about a ride on a donkey?
Steal him?
Finn Dove!
No, borrow him.
He'll find his way back when we turn him loose.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Up you go.
How do you like riding on a donkey?
I like the van better.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Won't he think we're two boys?
No, we fooled the police once, I'm afraid.
BO Y: You're a thief, that's what you are!
Who's a thief?
BO Y 2: That's our donkey!
FINN:
Get off! Get off!
Stop it!
Doesn't take the whole gang of you to whip two kids!
They stole Mo.
And why did you steal him?
We just found him on the road.
And you just found yourself on his back too, ey?
My little brother was tired, so we rode.
To sell him at the next town.
We'd have left him in a field, the same way we found him.
And some farmer would get the police, and they'd put Mo in the pound.
And my father would have to pay to get him out!
Well, how would I know these things?
We only borrowed him.
Liar!
Aye, liar!
Come on, there, kids!
Come on, Derval, run!
Holy Mother of God!
What is it?
DA: Well, well, well.
Who would believe it?
What's up, Da?
Didn't I just see pictures of the two of them on telly in town only this morning?
But who are they?
A pair of English runaways.
Finn and Derval Dove.
FINN:
Run, Derval! DA: Now, then, now, then.
Do I look like a man that'd hand you over to the police?
Would you?
Ah, you do me wrong.
Now, I know you're trying to find your dear old granny in County Galway.
And that cop down there has his eyes on you.
But in the morning, you'll travel across Shannon Bridge just like one of us, and none of the cops will know the difference.
Really, mister?
As sure as my name's Powder Ryan.
Ah, Sheila, they look starved.
Take them over and give them some stew from the pot.
Are you hungry?
[IN UNISON] Hungry?
No.
I am!
Wait for me!
What do the old Irish words mean, Sheila?
They're about the far-off place.
We call it Tir na nog.
What place?
Tir na nog.
It's a beautiful magic place of the young, where you long to be.
Like us going to Granny's?
Aye.
Or me going far across the sea.
Then you'll go, Sheila?
No.
No one ever reaches the far-off place.
No tinker girl, anyways.
We'll get to Granny's.
If Tobias Cromwell says I kidnapped my grandchildren, he's a liar!
REPORTER [ON TV]: But Mr: Cromwell has a court order to recover the children:
When my grandchildren reach my house, nobody is going to tak e them away from me, excepting over my dead body!
Can you hear me, Finn and Derval?
Come to County Galway, and welcome!
REPORTER: Meanwhile, the whereabouts of the children are still unknown:
Foul play is suspected:
The reward has been raised to £200:
You know, as long as those kids are missing, that reward's gonna go up every day.
Aye.
I shouldn't wonder.
TOUR GUIDE: Here at Shannon Bridge, we see a typical Irish country fair.
All domestic livestock are bought and sold or bartered.
There are games of chance as well.
Tinker children beg for coppers.
When the Sunday mass is over, some of the locals will leave the pubs for the next service.
While thirsty worshippers, refreshed in soul, often indulge in moister spirits.
Oh, boy, that was a long one.
I'm going to the next mass.
DERVAL: Spare a copper, please.
We're very hungry.
Please help us.
We're very hungry.
Spare a copper, please.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!
God bless you.
Help us, please.
We're very hungry.
Smile.
There you are.
FINN: Derval!
Oh, Finn!
Shh!
The police are looking for a 12-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, not the other way round.
You look so funny.
Derval, shame on you for begging.
I was only trying to help the tinkers.
Look at all the money I've earned.
Derval, the tinkers have to beg.
There isn't work for tinkers anymore.
They don't beg, they don't eat.
Because we're not tinkers, it's not right to beg?
Well, it's not respectable.
But it's all right to eat with tinkers.
Derval, they've been very good to us.
When we get to Granny's, we'll find some way to make things up.
Come on, let's find Sheila and give her that money back.
All of it?
All of it.
WOMAN: Over here, dear.
Gorgeous.
Just smile, please!
Thank you very much.
Just one more.
Would you lift your head?
Gorgeous.
Here's sixpence.
No, thank you.
Oh, yes, you take it.
What a clever child.
Fab little face.
This is the most beautiful place I've been in a long time.
£400.
That's better.
Excuse me, sir, have you seen Sheila?
Why, Finn?
To say goodbye to her.
You're going somewhere, Finn?
To our granny's in the west.
You ain't going anywhere, Finn Dove.
Very interesting indeed.
Thank you.
I've just had some information that might interest you about your Inspector Walcott.
Hold on.
Just a minute, sir.
This call is from some man in Killeen's popping to Hyde Street.
He says he's got the Dove children with him there.
Don't hang up, we're on the way.
FINN: Let go my arm!
Da, what are you doing?
Keep out.
I've just made £400.
And I've rung the police.
Da, you wouldn't sell a couple of poor kids for money?
They can't be poor if they're worth £400!
Look, I'm sorry.
He's like this when he's on the drink.
Now all we have to do is wait.
Please let us go!
Please!
And lose £400?
DA:
Hey!
Hey! Come back here!
Get in!
Get in there!
Get in there!
Come with me.
Come with me.
Leave them alone!
I saw you ill-treating those little things!
Ah, lady, you don't understand.
I do.
Just because they're tinkers.
They have as much right to Ireland as you!
Look, I'm taking care of them.
Leave them alone, or I shall send for the police!
I've already rung myself for the police.
To arrest two little tinkers?
I'm not a tinker!
We're the Dove children, miss.
You're the runaway children.
I'm Finn Dove, and this is my sister, Derval.
Oh, in disguise.
What a super story for my paper.
Hold on.
The reward money is mine.
We can tell you everything from when we ran away.
Until we get to Granny's.
You must get there, darling, you simply must.
We all want you to win.
If I had time, I'd take you myself.
Nobody's taking the kids anywhere!
Oh, aren't I?
Run, you kids! Run!
Quick, my car's just outside.
Thanks for everything, Sheila.
Would you help someone yourself, someday, that's in trouble?
I won't forget.
WOMAN [YELLING]:
Run! Aye, run!
Duck!
Stay here!
Powder Ryan?
I was till a minute ago.
Well, where are the children?
I was attacked, do you see?
They've been kidnapped.
I told you!
It was a woman, wasn't it?
A woman with two great big strapping brothers?
That's right.
Three or four huge powerful terrible brothers, they were.
But I didn't rightly see.
It was a woman, a young woman!
Sheila!
You saw it happen?
To my shame, I did.
Which way did they go?
Now, Sheila...
You wouldn't want to fool us, now, would you, Sheila?
No, sir.
Look, Sheila, you like Finn and Derval, and they're in great danger.
Now, Sheila, can you tell us which way they went?
That way.
In a car.
Did you see the number of the car?
No. Just a green car.
You can get out now, kids, we're in the country.
Oh, I love Ireland!
Cool green fields, soft warm hearts of the people.
The land of O'Casey, Shaw, Yeats, Robbie Burns...
Gorgeous!
Miss Marblestone, you're the only grown-up who's been really kind to us.
Don't be silly, dear, I just want to get on the front page with your story.
Yes..."Flight of the Doves," by Heather Marblestone.
I bet you've had a lot of scoops.
I'm the poetry editor, Finn.
I write "Quiet Corner" and the daily horoscope.
I don't get scoops.
Now, tell me all about your trip, beginning with the escape.
You've let them slip through your clutches not once, but three times!
Oh, dearie, dearie me, what.
I do wish Inspector Walcott had stayed on.
I've got news for you.
I had a phone call.
Chief Inspector Walcott of the Liverpool police is on holiday in Rome.
He never has been to Ireland.
The man we met is an impostor.
Hawk Dove.
Who's he?
He's their uncle.
He gets all the money if anything happens to the kids.
Money?
Perhaps you'd better tell us the whole story, Mr. Cromwell.
I liked best riding on the donkey.
Oh, riding a donkey!
What a pity you didn't take photographs.
We didn't have a camera.
Never mind, darlings, I shall take hundreds of pictures of you on the road.
Oh, could we?
Thousands.
This is fun, Miss Marblestone.
Yes.
Look!
It's an old castle.
It's gloomy.
MARBLESTONE:
It's perfect.
He's an actor, you see.
He specialises in make-up and disguises.
He could've impersonated Walcott.
And Lord knows who else.
Look, find Finn and Derval, and I'll make this reward £1000 to you personally.
If you'd told us from the beginning we might be dealing with a potential murderer...
Rourke here. Alert all mobile units in County Galway to be on the lookout for an actor, Hawk Dove.
The tower.
FINN: Cor, it's spooky, isn't it?
It's scary.
Here, my dear, hold my hand, and you'll feel safe.
Before that ruin, came for centuries rough men-at-arms, cross-gartered to the knees.
It's all right, Derval.
There's no need to be frightened.
You're perfectly safe.
MARBLESTONE: AII, shod in iron, climbed the narrow stairs...
Let's go.
Wait till you see the view up here, Derval!
MARBLESTONE: Set all your mind upon the steep ascent, upon the broken, crumbling battlement.
I'd hate to have a break down now we're so close.
Are you too scared to talk?
It's all right, Derval, you're perfectly safe.
[DERVAL STAMMERS] F...
Finn... Look!
The Gardai-inspector car was coming, so I ducked out of sight.
You are clever, Finn.
Yes...
This is exactly what I want.
We're safe and alone now.
Finn, Derval, stand near the edge.
White birds on the foam of the sea...
Come on, Derval, smile for the camera.
Let me just fix Derval's costume.
Ah!
It's Hawk!
I'm slipping!
Help me!
I hope he doesn't drown, just catch a cold.
And stay in bed.
And have to take medicine.
Come on.
Sergeant, I want as many men out as you can get together, and get everyone in the village you can to help too.
And sergeant, will you hurry, for the love of God?
The childrens' lives are in danger.
Slainte:
Why are we running now?
Uncle Hawk.
But we left Uncle Hawk in the ocean.
Listen, I wouldn't trust Uncle Hawk if I went to his funeral.
What about Uncle Toby?
I'm glad we don't have any more uncles.
Come on, let's go.
FINN: Here's a car.
Duck!
Oh, Finn, you should never have brought me along.
You could have made it without me.
I'm sorry.
I'm only a girl.
If I'd been a boy, we might've made it.
But I love you, Finn, even more than I love Granny.
And I didn't want to be left behind.
But now I'm sorry, because neither of us will ever reach...
Granny!
Finn, look, it's Granny's house!
We... We did it!
Oh, Derval, we did it!
[IN UNISON] Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
SEAMUS: Finn!
PADD Y: Derval!
FINN: It's Uncle Paddy!
DERVAL: It's Uncle Seamus!
SEAMUS PADD Y: Hello, kids.
Hello, hello.
Come on, up!
That's the girl.
SEAMUS:
Come on! Yahoo!
DERVAL: Yahoo!
SEAMUS: Yahoo!
DERVAL: Yahoo!
ALL: Whoo!
Yahoo!
FINN:
Granny! Derval!
Sweetheart!
Oh!
My darling!
You're not my grandchildren.
You look like a couple of tinkers!
We were tinkers.
What's that in your hair?
Stove polish.
What you both need is a good hot bath.
Are you really Granny?
This house and all we have belongs to you.
Oh, Granny.
Don't get soft now, things aren't over yet.
Here come the police.
Inside with you both.
SERGEANT: Squad, halt!
Right turn!
Mrs. O'Flaherty, those children are wards of the court.
I'll have to take them away.
What children?
Oh, for God's sake, Mrs. O'Flaherty, didn't I just see them go into the house?
Did you see any children?
Let's go into the house, and we can settle this once and for all.
Certainly.
Have you a warrant?
What would I be doing with a warrant?
Then put one of your big O'Casey toes across my threshold, and I'll have you arrested, sergeant!
I can soon get a warrant.
Come back with a regiment of soldiers and all the police in the county!
Come back with a machine-gun and the hydrogen bomb!
Do your worst, sergeant!
Nobody is going to take those children from the O'Flahertys.
SERGEANT: Squad, attention!
SERGEANT: Squad, halt!
Right turn!
What are all these men doing here?
Just having a bit of a rest before the day's work.
They don't look like that to me.
Here's that warrant your sister demanded.
Hey, Mary, the sergeant wants you!
Well, now you look like you belong to myself.
If the sergeant comes in the front way,
Dermot Cochrane will come in the back door and take you to his house down the road.
And if they get a warrant for that house, we'll shift you to another.
There are enough houses in all Galway to keep changing into for over 100 years!
Are you there, Dermot?
DERMOT: I'm here, on guard.
Here's the warrant!
I'm serving it on you.
You are now in contempt of court!
I must enforce the law!
Who's stopping you?
Who's stopping me?
Will you listen to the man who has suffered most over all this?
Mr. Cromwell!
I thought St. Patrick had driven the snakes out of Ireland.
Mrs. O'Flaherty, I was your daughter's husband, and I cherished her.
And I cherished her children.
Now, please, I want my children back, Mrs. O'Flaherty!
You never had any children, Tobias Cromwell.
There isn't a single drop of your blood flowing in the veins of Finn and Derval Dove!
That's enough, now!
All right, get ready, men.
If we can't do it the peaceful way, we'll do it the hard way.
Hello, sergeant.
Trouble?
We get trouble, we can take it.
You know Judge Liffy?
Sergeant, I want to lodge a complaint against this man.
I was fishing peacefully when he practically kidnapped me.
I'll charge him later. Bah!
My God, we're glad to see you, Your Honour.
We better go with you now, Mr. Cochrane, because Uncle Toby's coming in the front way now.
I'm only here in a private capacity, you understand, sort of in loco parentis, since, in a way, I am the legal father.
Will you let us in so we can discuss the matter?
Yeah, please?
All right.
Come in, come in.
You'll have to excuse the way the house is.
What are we doing here, Mr. Cochrane?
Granny said you were taking us to your house.
What have you got behind your back?
Well, now, I got a little surprise for you.
I love surprises.
Turn around and don't look till I tell you.
Cover your eyes, now.
It's Uncle Hawk!
Run!
Not a sound.
Don't move!
Uncle Hawk, why do you wanna kill us?
I don't want to kill you! They're driving me to it.
Them!
Always giving me the filthy half of the deal.
It's my money.
Should've come to me.
$10,000 they're not going to cheat me this time.
I'm going to win just this once.
I got to win just this once, don't you understand?
Will you stop looking at me like that?
I'm tired of being a loser!
You don't look a bad man, Uncle Hawk.
You're not scary at all.
If it's the money you want, you can have it.
We've got everything we want.
We can live here with Granny.
We can have a donkey.
And a pony.
And some little ducks.
And a big dog.
Please don't kill us, Uncle Hawk.
I knew there was some way I was going to lose this one.
I'm their legal guardian!
And this is the court order granting me custody of the children.
Heaven forbid!
From whom did you obtain this court order?
From my solicitor, Mr. Purdon.
I am Purdon.
That court order is a fake.
I am not a solicitor.
Your grandchildren, Mrs. O'Flaherty.
CROMWELL: Hello!
ROURKE: Just who are you?
John Cyril Dove, theatrically known as Hawk Dove.
I'll find another solicitor.
I'll get that court order.
Not when I testify your only interest in these kids is their money.
ROURKE: It's your own fault, Mr. Cromwell.
You never would have fooled me with that terrible performance.
[SPEAKING IN WALCOTT'S VOICE] Listen, lad.
If they were your kids out there, maybe hungry, maybe cold, would you still think it was routine?
Very clever.
But John Cyril Dove, I arrest you for impersonating an officer, for obstructing the police...
Arrest me?
When I brought the kids back to their granny?
Why is it, every time I try to do something right, the cards are stacked against me?
I have been known to temper justice with mercy, Mr. Dove...
Ha!
Mercy!
Mercy?
The quality of mercy is not strained.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Take him to the next room, somebody.
It is twice blessed.
It blesses...
What are you doing?
It blesses him that gives and him that takes...
LIFFY: Thank you.
Holy St. Patrick!
What was that all about?
The Merchant of Venice, Act 4, scene 1.
I don't haven't heard it done quite like that before.
Well, now, I think it's high time we had a word from the source of all this mischief.
Children, come here.
So you are Finn Dove?
Yes, sir.
I suppose you think you've done a great deed by running away from home, crossing the sea, making hares out of the police and triumphantly arriving your destination?
No, sir.
What?
It wasn't much to do with me, sir.
It's Derval.
She's very young, and look at the way she kept going.
I see.
And if you return to your Uncle Toby, what would you do?
We would run away again the first chance we've got.
Why?
Was your Uncle Toby cruel to you?
It's not that.
It's love.
Children should have someone to love them.
Girls like Derval.
See, I knew Granny would be crackers about her if I could get to her.
But I'm older, I can take care of myself.
But it's Derval.
Uncle Toby didn't care for her, and she has to have someone to love her.
And there was nobody.
In my job, Finn, we come up against a lot of sadness and injustice.
But that's what we're here for, to unravel such things.
Well, Mr. Cromwell?
Were you unkind to the children?
Oh, never, never!
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
Not at all, Your Honour.
I disciplined them, you know, from time to time, for their own good.
But I gave them everything. MARY:
Everything!
Except love!
And let me give you some advice, which is all you'll be getting from me, Mr. Tobias Cromwell.
Upon my ground, you've brought the press and the people from the telly and heaven knows what other riff-raff, trampling over my garden and frightening my chickens and my ducks and my geese!
Order in court!
This is not your court!
This is my house, and you're a guest, Brendan Liffy...
Your Honour.
Good point.
Continue.
If you was to tell them reporters that for the welfare of the children you was willing to let them stay here, you might come out of this trouble as some sort of slimy hero!
LIFFY: What say you, Cromwell?
You have left me no alternative.
I'll see to the legal details.
My teddy bear.
You have left me with nothing.
And you, Mary O'Flaherty, court or no court, the charges against you are very serious.
You have defied the courts and, with that mob out there, you have threatened to intimidate the law.
You have, in addition, taken the law into your own hands.
And at the present time, you are harbouring known fugitives.
If two young children are criminals, there's no justice in Ireland!
Justice may sometimes be blind, but sometimes it can perceive truth.
Finn Dove and Derval Dove, do you promise never more to cause such a commotion and never to try to run away again?
Then, Finn and Derval Dove, it is my painful duty to remand you to the custody... of Mary Magdalene St. Bridget O'Flaherty of County Galway, Ireland.
It's over!
It's over!
You belong to me!
There's just one more thing, Your Honour.
Hm?
Oh, yes.
Bring Hawk Dove back in here.
Please don't send him to prison.
Couldn't he have the reward for finding us?
Oh, I don't think there'll be any serious charges.
Holy Mother of God!
He stole my uniform!
He took my bike!

Heheheh!
Hey!
Monseigneur, Grandee.
Buenas tardes, amigos!
The taxes are there, Minister.
The salt, land and spice taxes... how much, this year?
200,000 ducats.
-Last year it was more!
-The harvest was very good.
This year's was very bad. So you must pay double!
All these taxes are for the king!
Don Salluste, our people are terribly poor.
That's normal.
The poor were meant to be poor and the rich to be rich.
Come on, come on...☻
Hurry up!
I have 3 more villages to visit.
Gather that up... hurry!
Where's the cheering? ☻
The enthusiasm?
Viva Don Salluste.
Viva Don Salluste.
Viva our benefactor!
Viva our benefactor!
- Our friend!
- Viva our friend.
- Olé!
- Olé.
- Olé!
- Olé.
Not quite.
It'll have to do!
The coach looks solid, but it isn't. Hey?
The coach looks solid, but it's not.
Leaks like a sieve!
Stuff just falls out.
Blaze!
So, if I were you, I'd...
Follow the coach!
All this, for the King.
That's for me.
That... is for me.
That's for me.
That's for me.
Hey, careful!
Hey!
Ho! Easy!
The spice tax is for...?
Salluste? -yes!
(No for the King!
)
Oh, leave me alone!
Is the land tax for the King?
No, it's for Salluste!
(Thief!
) - No, not at all!
It's for Salluste, that's that!
Look out!
Hold on, sir.
I'll help you.
Ay-ay-ay!
My ruff!
I'll help you, Monseigneur.
No!
That's my gold!
And my gold is MY gold!
And I don't need you!
- You sure?
- Ah!
What's happening?
The villagers, are cheering for you.
-Cheering for me?
- Yes.
I should've tripled the take.
Ahh!
Death to him!
Blaze!
Blaze!
Blaze!
Help!
Aah!
Blaze!
Help.
Help.
Help.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop, will you!
Wait!
Help!
Why'd you get off?
My good Blaze!
Here!
My hand!
Help, my good Blaze!
Hold tight, my dear Blaze.
Ah!
Ah!
Don't let me go!
Such a good Blaze!
Thank you, my dear Blaze.
They weren't cheering me.
Not cheering at all!
Take that!
And that!
And that!
They weren't cheering!
They weren't cheering me!
Those crooks!
See that?
They almost had me!
Oh, yes Sir!
That's "The People" for you!
Not there!
Not there!
There!
Not enough lather.
Not enough hair either.
Ay!
Ayay, ay!
Don't move.
Ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Voilà!
Now, Blaze... flatter me.
Monseigneur is the grandest of all the Spanish Grandees.
That's no flattery, it's just true...
Well?
Imbecile.
What?
"Imbecile" I said to the Duke's valet.
"My master is not the issue of an inbred marriage"
"Take a good look", he said.
"Don't go by appearences", I said.
"Just because his mother married his aunt's half brother
"who was his father's first cousin"
Are you sure that's flattery?
I thought of something else but I don't dare.
Go on, dare!
Go on!
Monseigneur is... handsome.
Do you actually believe what you said?
Well, I'm flattering you.
Good night, Your Majesty.
Was ist das?
The Queen!
Ach!
Schön. (Lovely)
Vergissmeinnicht! (Forget-me-nots)
Myosotis!
(mouse's ear)
The Queen has a knave!
That could be worth a fortune!
It's Blaze!
There's the old bat.
Things are heating up!
A Queen of Spain receives flowers from no one.
Not even from the King!
Whew!
Oh!
♪ La-la laii...!
Oh!
Now the gallows-bird starts to sing.
You, up there, Blaze!
Blaze!
Are you crazy?
You'll wake the whole palace!
Niemals trank ein Liebes Wort an mein Ohr (Never have my ears drunk love words)
Warum?
(Why?
)
That's the Queen, she's Bavarian.
Pretty, but stupid!
What a lovey song!
Majesty.
A Queen of Spain does not listen to songs... when the King is out hunting.
Hunters, weepers. Lovers, keepers.
Olé!
Because I love the Queen.
Me, a valet, "I dare"!
He's stomping around, now!
Just you wait, I'll show you!
Blaze, my valet, lover of the Queen!
The fool will get himself drawn and quartered!
C'mere, you!
C'mere!
He sings, he taps!
He stomps!
Hey!
Knock off the noise "Romeo" it's 2 in the morning!
Hey!
Ho!
Let me go!
Let go.
Ho!
Aaah!
Golden time!
Golden sunrays.
Wake up and smell the gold.
Monseign'or'!
It's 8 'or'clock!
Kitchi, kitchi, kootchi!
One's missing!
You sure?
'Gold' damn sure!
I say!
Look under the bed.
There!
There it is!
Look!
Look at this!
- What?
-You're too tall!
You're my valet, c'mon!
I sould be able to see that!
That's better.
Give me my breadsticks.
Monseigneur is in a good mood!
No, I'm not!
And you know why!
Why?
'Cause last night, bom bom bom tagada tagada!
Gling gling gling, tarata taratata!
Digading digadigadigading
Monseisei...

Monseigneur!
It's th-the... the...
The what?
The Queen!
The Queen here, at this hour?
My doublet, my fleece, hurry!
Take that off!
Dress me!
Dress me!
Yes! The Infanta's hand is mine, now.
And I'm not letting her go.
I didn't know that you and the Infanta...
My ruff!
- There...
- You don't understand...
The Queen's coming to tell me that I'm to be... the King's SON-IN-LAW!
How extraordinary, since they have no children!
King's NEPHEW, then! Same thing.
All I need is for the King to have a hunting accident...
Pow!
Then, fat cousin Léopold...
Pow!
Then, little Duke d'Anjou...
Ngh!
Lots of hunting accidents. Pow!
Pow!
Pow!
And voilà, I'm King!
And we'll avoid the War of the Spanish Succession.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
Quick, tidy up!
Make way for the Queen.
Seid still!
(Be still)
Ruhe!
Ruhe, die Hunde!
Ruhe!
(Quiet, dogs)
Sie haben meine Ehrendame entehrt. (You dishonored my Lady in Waiting)
Euh... what?
Was?
Und die Unschuld eines jungen deutschen Mädchen missbraucht!
(And abused the innocence of a young German girl)
Ah!
Danke schön!
(Thank you)
Schmall Infanta! Schön!
(lovely)
Ich bin happy meine aunt.
Meine auntie!
Ach!
Raus, die Zwerge! Los!
Raus, schnell!
(Out dwarfs, away!
Out quickly)
"Raus...
Schnell..."
What a lovely tongue!
Sie sind abgesetzt, verbannt und ausgewiesen.
Ihr Vermögen ist beschlagnahmt zu Gunsten der Krone.
What's she saying?
Don Salluste, you are dismissed, demoted, exiled.
You lose your your title "Knight of the Golden Fleece", and your functions as Minister of Police and of Finance.
All your holdings are confiscated by the crown.
But what did I do?
Ein Kind, Don Salluste!
An infant!
Your Majesty.
What's this?
Who is this?
You revuze to regoknize zis paby off my Lady in Vaitink?
How can I recognize it, I don't even know it!
Ja!
Ja!
Ja!
Ja ja ja?
...
Nein!
Zeduzed und abandoned, he has!
Verfürt und verlassen.
Liar!
She's a liar.
She's lying in German.
This child is a false witness.
Warum mich?
Ich habe nicht!
She and I, nada! Nada!
Never! Nothing!
Your Majesty, Das ist eine kolossal Konspirazion!
Don Salluste, you vill leaf Madridt tomorrow.
After returnink your Golden Fleece to ze Kingk!
Madame!
Wait!
Majesty don't be influenced by a newborn baby.
Alright, I recognise this child, and all my faults, and mine and other people's children.
Your children, if it please you.
- Villain!
- Scoundrel!
Look, he's as green as his gloves. (furious? )
His disgrace serves our purpose.
Tomorrow, he'll return his Golden Fleece to the King.
It's an unexpected stroke of luck.
We must act fast.
Oh, amigos!
Amigos!
Oh!
Hey!
Not that!
That's mine.
No!
That's mine too.
No, you can't have my table.
Hey you, give us a hand!
Sure.
Allez...hop! .
My forks!
The Queen said to take away everything.
Everything!
I didn't take anything.
Yes, you did.
Who put that in my pants?
What'll become of me?
I'm a Minister, I don't know how to do anything!
We can look for a job together, Monseigneur.
You, piss off!
Disappear! I never want to see you again.
- Who'll pay my wages?
- Your wages?
Take that!
I dismiss you.
You no longer exist for me.
Let me hav...
If you don't mind! ...
- It's my broom.
- Bandit!
Con man!
Punk!
You bitch of a Queen!
Slutten!
I'll get my revenge.
Take that!
Hey, One-eye!
- Monseigneur...
- Alright, enough.
- Do you know César?
- The bandit?
César the bandit.
- Yes. - You must get ahold of him.
No one's seen him for 10 years, and me with one eye...
You see very well with one eye!
Alright, you don't see that well.
Anyway... once you find the first half the other half can't be far.
César! Nephew!
Crook!
Lout!
I'm here!
Scoundrel.
It's me.
Where are you?
Up here.
Up where?
Over here.
Ah!
There he is.
I'm coming.
So, you old creep... you crawled out of your hole, and you need me?
I have a proposition for you.
Does it pay well?
A fortune -- mine!
Do you take me for an ass?
No, not that way.
Not this way.
Move along.
Ah!
Listen to me.
César, the bandit, the crook, disappears.
Forgotten! Paf! Forget about him.
He's gone!
And becomes 'Don' César.
I'll tell the court you just got back from the Americas.
And you seduce the Queen.
Is it true what they say? You fell fom Her grace?
You seduce the Queen.
I send an anonymous letter to the King.
He catches you in the act, repudiates her... and puts me back in power.
Can you imagine finding, anywhere in Spain,... such an idiot to fall for such a ploy?
An idiot!
I had one, but I was stupid enough to fire him.
So, you're saying no, right?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Very good.
Very good.
Here he is.
What'll we do with him?
To Africa!
To the Berbers!
You're a more treacherous coward than I thought.
Sell him. I never want to hear of him, again.
Go!
Death to Salluste!
Kill Salluste!
Thief!
Punish him!
Long live the King!
Death to Salluste!
Be right there.
Hey!
What's this... hmm?
Ah!
A lady like you... walking the streets of Madrid at this hour?
That's not prudent.
Think it's more prudent like this, imbecil?
-Oh!
Monseigneur!
- Shh!
-Know wham here?
- What?
Do you know why I'm here?
- No.
Since you left I've sunk into a frightful depression.
Sir doesn't realise what 'she's' saying.
I do. I thought of you a lot since this morning.
Give me your hand.
- No!
- Give it, here.
Gimme your hand.
Oh!
What a destiny!
You're homely - she's a beauty!
You're broke - she's very rich.
You're an idiot - she is too.
You're a valet - she's The Queen.
It's written there!
She doesn't even know I exist.
What if, I, with my magic wand, made this difference vanish in one night?
What if I turned you into... Prince Charming?
Give me back your hand.
- No.
- Yes.
- No!
What luck you have!
And that luck is me!
This way, Monseigneur.
On your knees before the King.
He likes people on the ground.
When he arrives, you crawl.
But, the Queen?
Even on the ground, she'll recognise me.
Do you know how many lackeys, like you, are in this palace?
- No.
- 800! So...
Let's review.
Alright, I don't say "chez" the barber's but "to" the barber.
No, the other way.
Not "to", but, "chez" the barber's.
And you don't just say "hello" but "meeting you here makes this a happy place".
That's very good.
Very good!
Your place is squalid!
How can one live in such a mess?
This is where Monseigneur lodges his staff.
Ahh! It's lovely.
Very nice.
Are you happy, here?
- Huh?
- Yes.
Get undressed.
What is your name?
Don César, Count of Gafaro.
No, Ga-RO-fa, Count of Garofa!
Returned from the Americas.
Ga-RO-fa!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, hup!
- Hup!
- No!
You really have no class!
How about lying...
Can you lie?
It's very useful at court. Hm?
Tell me a big lie.
Let's see if I believe you or not.
A really big one. Go!
Yesterday, in the coat-tails of Sir's green suit, I found 300,000 ducats.
Huh? !
Where are they?
Under my straw mattress.
Thief!
Thief! You robbed me.
No, Monseigneur, I lied to you.
Long live the King!
The King.
Dismount.
Put your hat back on.
You're a Spanish Grandee.
Grandees cover themselves before the King.
Fine, let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't excuse yourself. The poor excuse themselves.
When you're rich, you're obnoxious.
Fine, let's go.
Una 'merveillosa'!
In Florence they call this "una macchina infernale". (infernal machine)
Are you mocking us, Giuseppe?
This ridiculous firecracker wouldn't hurt a fly.
Later on, I multiply the explosion by a thousand... and the King of Spain... poof!
Messieurs.
In a moment, the King will be dead.
One for all, each for himself.
What's gotten into you?
I can't, Sir. I feel awful.
Can't we come back tomorrow?
My Golden Fleece gets revoked today, not tomorrow.
Don't you wanna get to know the Queen?
- Yes, but...
- Move, then!
No!
I said no.
What if they ask what I saw in the Americas?
Americans!
And with this, 'you know who'... will know who you are.
Achh!
Voila.
The Infanta.
Your fiancée, Monseigneur?
My compliments.
Prrpt!
Prrpt!
Ugly brat.
Ill-bred, to boot.
I should've got a better man to present me to the Queen.
-Not a man with a revoked Fleece.
- Ingrate!
I spent all night transforming a worm into a hidalgo.
Pfff!
Ill-bred!
Did you see that?
Where is he?
Where'd he go?
Where are you going?
-Last night, I lost my head.
- I don't care.
Stay!
And I wonder why you'd do all this for me... hm?
No, I'd better go.
I order you to stay.
No, Monseigneur, that's enough.
Bow, scrape, stand, sit, lie, salute like this, talk like that...
I've had enough.
- Shut up!
So, Mr. Marquis, good day to you!
Oh you...
You're...
Oh, yes, Monseigneur!
I'm ill-bred too.
Crrrk!
The King!
The Queen!
Is the exit this way or that?
My Lords, the Grandees!
Aiy!
Aiy!
My Lords, cover yourselves.
- My money! Did you forget?
- You'll be paid after.
-No money, no bomb! - Shh!
Listen, Giuseppe,... here's a promissory note.
No!
The other half after the explosion.
Start the mechanism.
Careful, it'll blow in exactly 4 minutes, 30 seconds.
When it explodes, be at least 20 metres from the throne.
My God, the Queen!
Hurry, hurry, Monsignor.
-Where's the throne?
- That way.
Don Salluste,...
Marquis of Montalégré,
Baron Del Pisco, by order of his Majesty, our beloved King,
you will retire to the monastery of Saint Ignacio... where you'll take a vow of chastity... and of poverty.
Oh no, not poverty!
Sire?
Sire, Don Salluste awaits Your Majesty's pleasure.
Don Salluste!
You're no longer worthy to be our companion.
As the Queen informed you... we retract your title of 'Knight of the Golden Fleece'.
It's heavy.
Enough, Salluste!
Look out!
Huh?
Watch out, it's going to blow!
Watch out, Sire!
The cushion!
The cushion!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Aaah!
No!
It's Salluste!
It's Salluste!
He tried to kill the King.
Arrest him!
There he is.
It's not me.
I was here.
I didn't move from here.
Liar!
Salluste!
Salluste!
No, Sire. For once, it wasn't me.
I was here, praying.
Excuse me, your Majesty. It's not him, it's him. Look.
Give me back that paper.
Look, Sire, here's the proof.
Quickly!
Who are you, sir... who just saved our life?
Well, your Majesty, I'm...
I, I, I, I...
I'm...
My nephew, Sire.
Don César...
Count of Gafaro.
- Ga-ro-fa!
Count of Garofa.
Returned from the Americas...
Where I saw many Americans.
Don Salluste.
Yes, Sire?
You have 5 minutes to leave forever, through the Puerta del Sol.
He really has it in for me.
- What? - Has it in for me.
César!
That's you.
César, come here.
César, Von Garofa!
On your knees.
I hope you'll be more worthy of it than your uncle.
Yes, Sire.
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations...
To the Puerta del Sol!
You're little bomb wasn't very well rigged.
It exploded way too early... pft!
But my bomb... my big bomb, there will explode much later.
But when it blows, it'll make a frightful scandal.
I don't understand.
Never mind.
Off to Barbary!
Paf!
Ah!
You son of a bitch, Salluste!
I'll have your hide.
Enough, César.
You've told this story 50 times.
Yalla, yalla!
Yalla!
Yalla!
Where are you from?
Madrid.
The King sold me for 500 dinars.
The treasury's still empty.
Asshole, Salluste!
There have been big changes.
Salluste is no longer in power.
It's César now, his nephew.
César?
!
Goddamit, I'M César!

Mmmmm!
- César.
- Sire?
What do you figure it'll be?
Oh, 3 to 4 million ducats, Sire.
The "volontary" contribution of His Excellency, the Marquis Del Basto.
But, Sire, I don't understand.
The Del Bastos haven't paid taxes for 300 years.
There's a first time for everything.
- By what right?
- Divine right.
What do you make of that, my dear Del Basto?
Oh!
Your Majesty!
Next, gentlemen!
The brigand!
That brigand took 5 million.
I won't pay.
I will pay, gentlemen. But I'll have the last laugh.
- César?
- Yes, Sire?
Why are your boots always shinier than mine?
I polish them myself, Sire.
Yourself?
Hold on, I'll show you.
It's very simple.
Give me your leg.
the Marquis of Priégo... the Duke of Los Montès and the Duke of Sandoval.
Allow me.
Excuse me, Sire, but it's the only way.
Voila.
Every morning.
- Every morning?
- Yes, every morning.
-Come on, give me your leg.
- No.
Oh, come on.
- Sire!
Sire, I protest.
The poor pay taxes, not the rich.
Exactly. Not very fair, was it, Sire?
That's why we changed all that.
There's a lot less gold on the scales than before. Don't you think, César?
Yes, I think so too, Sire.
Pardon me!
Oh-lala, practically nothing!
Alley-oop!
Let me down.
Come on, don't pull that face!
Go, Brutus.
Your Majesty, I think...
Enough!
My horse!
Come, I'll take you hunting.
Sire, the Queen!
- She's waiting for you.
- Oh the Queen, the Queen!
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow.
I'll first kill 6 wolves, then I'll be back.
Allez!
Por aqui, por alla!
(Over here, over there)
Doña Isabella?
No!
Por aqui!
Por aqui!
Por aqui.
Por alla!
Your Majesty.
Don César.
Was wollen sie?
(What do you want)
Madam, the King won't be back until tomorrow.
He was called away on urgent affairs of state.
You lie so badly.
Das ist sehr delikat.
Plind-man's pluff, mit us, play, Don Zésar?
Your Majesty.
A Queen of Spain does not play blind-man's buff with a gentleman.
Wer sagt das?
(Who says? )
Etiquette, Madam!
Für dieses mal vergessen wie die Etikette! (forget etiquette, for once)
Blindfold the eyes of Etiquette.
What?
Madam... Majesty, you can't really...
Really, your Majesty!
Here I am.
Where are you?
Where are you, my little ones?
Por aqui. (falsetto)
Por alla!
Por aqui, Doña Juana!
Yo te tengo!
(I got you)
Si, si, si!
Un poquito mas, por favor!
(A little farther)
Por aqui!
Ole!
Who did that?
Who dared?
I was pushed.
Who pushed me?
I swallowed water.
I'm choking.
Madame!
Achtung!
(Careful) Doña Juana!
Don't worry, I drowned her.
Those little pests will pay for this.
I need to talk to your Majesty.
Das ist streng verboten. (strictly vorbidden)
Shh...
Shhh...
What's verboten is deceiving you.
To let you think I'm someone else.
Accepting the King's favours meanwhile I... Was sagen Sie?
Ich verstehe nicht. (What?
I don't understand)
Voila.
My name isn't César, it's Blaze.
I'm not Salluste's nephew. I'm his valet.
Ach...
Valais?
Valais!
Swiss, you are?
Why Swiss?
What Swiss?
Katastrophe!
Die Alte!
(the old lady)
Madame.
I don't know how...
- Don César!
Madame, I must tell you.
I love you!
You're so beautiful, so radiant, so luminous.
No...
Oh, yes, yes.
I've desired you for months.
I don't know if you do it on purpose. You're so coquettish with your mischievous eyes.
Your little feet.
Now that I've told you everything... if you want me to leave... tell me and I'll obey.
Oh!
You're crying, Madame!
Yes...
Don César!
-There you are!
- Shhh!
My dear Baron.
I want to talk to you about my taxes.
You must understand, it's very hard to meet the requirements.
César.
I'm yours, body and soul. Whenever you want.
Here's my hand.
Why do you sigh, César?
I love you too.
Not so fast.
Ah!
You savage!
Monseigneur, what if they recognise you?
6 months in exile, everyone's forgotten me.
Wait for me under the ramparts.
I'll join the procession.
Blaze is surely there.
Go!
Hey, Blaze, is that you?
No.
Hey, César, is that you?
Huh?
Nope, not him.
Guess why the Minister isn't here?
He's with the King, as usual.
Wanna know what they're doing?
Another new law.
Now, when you kill a domestic, you have to declare it.
Blaze!
- César!
- César! No doubt about it.
We need the courage to stab him in the back.
A plot against Blaze?
They'll fuck up everything!
Never thought I'd miss that old bastard, Salluste.
At least, he only stole from the poor.
The surest way is poison.
Tomorrow is his birthday.
Our best chance ever, to make him eat a big poisoned cake.
Imbecil!
But it wasn't me!
Del Basto!
Sandoval!
So, what time tomorrow?
3 o'clock at my place.
By 4, it'll all be over.
Aaaah!
Priégo!
Aaaaah!
Los Montès!
Hey?
Paf!
That... pfft!
Another plot.
Now, they want to kill Blaze.
I absolutely must warn him or my own plot is sunk.
Hey, mute.
Mute!
Mute!
He's deaf, to boot!
I'm listening.
You're talking too fast.
Repeat.
Don't shout, I'm not deaf!
I don't hear a thing.
What's he saying?
Stay out of our conversation.
You, continue!
Reforms? !
He's making reforms?
!
That's why they want him to eat the big cake a la creme.
Not to fatten him up, imbecile, to poison him.
We can't, at any cost, let him eat it.
Because, you imbecile... if they kill my poor little Blaze, tomorrow,
I can't have the King catch him in the Queen's bed.
The King, cuckolded by my valet, now, THAT'S vengeance!
For you, César, my best bull.
Look how brave he is.
I branded him with your momogram.
Priégo, 3 months ago, I took your gold. Now you offer me your best bull.
What does it mean?
It means, hombre, I have no hard feelings.
Come, there are more suprises, ahead.
Cyanide!
Caught you pilfering!
Animal!
Lout!
Rogue!
Just you wait.
Come with me to Don Marquis de Priégo.
- Not the Marquis.
He'll have you flogged.
It'll amuse the guests.
No, listen, your cream isn't sweet, it's salty.
- Salty?
- It's salty!
It's sweet.
It's salty...
Yum-yum, yum!
Go on, more.
The Marquis... a lackey?
What are you doing, Monseigneur?
- Hide me and dance! Quickly.
Calling on me among MY friends on MY birthday.
Enjoy your birthday. It's your last.
What?
Your birthday cake's poisoned.
Eat as little as possible, play for time. I'll do the rest.
They want to kill me? Who?
- YOUR friends!
César!
There they are.
Mistreat me!
So, César, are you coming?
Take that, you lout!
And that, scoundrel.
Not so hard.
- Take that!
Ayi!
Enough!
César, come cut your cake.
Gladly.
I'm deeply touched.
Really.
It's a very kind gesture among friends.
If there were fewer flies, it'd be perfect.
Because it's hot at this time.
(gotta play for time) ...
Never mind.
Shouldn't be that many...
Don't move...
No, but look!
See how many flies?
Look, look!
Don't move!
Don't move! Don't move!
Look!
There it is.
It's tasting my cake...
What? !
It's dead.
- How curious!
- What are you waiting for?
Cut your cake and eat it.
Such a fine cake merits a fine blade.
Bon appetit, gentlemen!
Treason!
Leave him to me.
Salluste!
This way, hurry!
There!
Oh!
Silence.
- Death to him!
Gentlemen, I offer you an execution. But not the bull's.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ole!
Ole!
Ole!
Gentlemen, our turn.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Aah!
Hahaha!
Thank you, Monseigneur, you saved me.
You're...
You're...
You're my prisoner! Up!
- But, Monseigneur...
What's gotten into you?
Let me go!
Dump him in there. Move!
Monseigneur?
Oh, come on!
Ho!
Shh!
Shh!
Enough.
Don't!
Enough now.
That's enough now, huh?
Look there.
The Queen's there...
Cooperate or I'll pluck you.
The Queen's up there.
Window with a balcony.
Look up there.
Very good.
Now let's rehearse... Are you listening?
Rehearse one last time.
OK, talk!
Ta-ta-talk! Go on!
Go on!
- Merde!
- You uncouth character!
After what I paid for you!
Don't say it again.
Now talk!
Prrrr!
Talk!
Now repeat after me.
César sent me. Go on.
César sent me.
Very good.
Perfect.
What do you say next?
Yo te quiero.
Not in Spanish, in German.
She's German.
Ich liebe dich.
Ich li...
Ich liebe dich, go on!
Hup!
This way!
No, not that window!
Why'd it go to the old lady?
What's it telling her?
César sent me.
César!
Caw, caw!
Caw, caw!
...
You say, tomorrow evening?
In the Cabeza Negra inn?
- He'll wait for you.
- He'll wait for me?
Jawohl, mein Lieber! (Yes, my love)
You made a mistake. Come here.
- No.
- Come!
- No!
The Queen is there, up there. Go on.
Ist da jemand im Garten?
(Anyone in the garden? )
Ach! Was für ein schöner Papagei!
(What a lovely parrot! )
Speak!
Tell her.
Ich liebe dich.
Wirklich?
(Really?
)
Ich bin sent by Don Césarrr!
Don César, are you zere?
Yo te quiero.
Rotten beast!
I'll fix you later!
Was für eine gute Idee! (What a good idea)
Das ist ganz romantisch! (It's so romantic)
Don César, are you fallink?
Nein, mein liebe, ich bin konfortabel!
Kommen Sie to see mich?
... me...
Tomorrow evening? The Cabeza Negra inn?
Ein rendezvous?
Das ist eine grosse folly!
Nein, little folly!
Can I count on you?
Count?
Ja, count:
Eins, zwei, drei...
Count!
Ja, I vill pee there.
Ach, she vill pee there!
Gute Nacht, Don César.
Auf Wiedersehen!
Mmmmm.
An anonymous letter for the King!
An anonymous letter for the King!
Sire, you're too strong for me.
An anonymous letter for the King!
Anonymous letter? !
Sire, your Majesty is a cuckold.
What?
Me?
Yes, you!
The Queen's cheating on you.
With who?
- With Don César.
The traitor!
The Queen intends to meet him this evening... at the Cabeza Negra inn.
And... in a moment, she'll come in and say:...
Majesty!
Your Majesty, mein papa, sick.
To Bavaria, go, may I, bitte?
When will you leave?
Tonight.
Sooner I leave, sooner I be back.
Go, Madame.
You may be certain my thoughts will follow your every step.
Danke, mein geliebter König. (my beloved King)
I don't understand anything, anymore.
Oh, you will understand!
Look here; you save me, you kidnap me, you tie me up... and you shave me.
Why, hm?
Well?
... Be careful!
What are you up to? Old bastard.
I'll tell you.
You're my pawn... I'm playing you.
I clean up my pawn.
There!
Look.
Remember that?
- Oh no, no!
- Yes, yes!
Oh yes!
That hurts.
Doesn't it hurt?
I perfume my pawn.
Voilà!
I tart up my pawn.
Making it handsome.
Irresistible.
Mmmmm.
Not happy, huh?
Finished. Voila!
How handsome!
Madame, look how handsome!
That's 3 times.
Never in 40 years, but, 3 times today;
me, a Grandee, ass-kicked by a lackey!
The asses of the lowly are as good as the asses of the Grand.
My, how your head has swelled!
It's enormous!
I'll have you arrested.
You're no longer Minister.
Wait!
I'm gagging my pawn...
- Woah!
Ho!
- Mmh!
Mmh!
Now, I'm calming my pawn.
Wait for it...
All done.
Hey, Mute!
One-eye!
Mute!
One-eye!
- Yes, Monseigneur?
- Still nobody?
- No.
You, keep your eye open.
And you: ...!
Talk! .
A mute...
Just my luck!
Ow!
Don't look.
There's nobody.
Go away, go!
Malaga.
Don't worry.
It's for beddy-byes.
Later, in that bed, when you wake up, you'll get a surprise.
Don't move.
I'll go make myself handsome, too. Back in 5 minutes.
Who are you?
Don César.
The real one.
There's somebody.
Mi amor! (My love)
Mi tesoro! (My treasure)
Mi hombre! (My man)
Mommy!
The parrot told me everything.
Really? Shh... the zebra under the bed can hear us.
This room, this love nest, these flowers, this supper!
Hmm, bite me again, wild man!
What if we drank something first?
You great fool!
Trying to get me drunk?
- You first.
-After you, Juanita.
Mi corazon!
Ahhh!
Monseigneur!
What is it?
What's happening?
The mute's been knocked out.
Blaze!
It must be him.
Ah!
The old dame!
What the hell's she doing here?
- Who is she?
- The dueña. (chaperone)
Where's the Queen?
Where's Blaze?
- The ingrate got away.
- He can't be far.
Go find him.
I need him in this bed right away.
Go!
You, this way;
me, that way.
Lemme go.
Oop-la!
You're so strong.
Make love to me.
No, we mustn't.
What's all this nonsense!
Go beddy-byes.
Who is it?
Ich bin es, Don César.
(it's me)
Ein Moment, bitte!
Kommen Sie, mein Liebling.
(come my darling)
It's done, Monseigneur!
- Shh!
I found him.
- Where is he?
I knocked him out and put him back in the bed, like you said.
Bravo!
Help me.
Ah!
César, my nephew.
You made a mistake, imbecile!
It's your nephew. It's him.
- No it's not!
I sold him to the Berbers.
I took their money and spent it.
- Where'd you find him?
- There, in the hall.
He must've escaped!
I'm going crazy!
Let's put him with the old dame.
Your Majesty, my Queen, mein Liebling.
You must wake up.
Quick, wake up.
One!
Two!
- Majesty, your Majesty!
- Ich liebe dich, César.
Wake up.
You don't understand He wants to compromise you.
Küssen sie mich!
"Küssen sie mich"?
... Ah yes, kiss.
Oh, your Majesty, I'd love to, but this is not the moment.
It's Blaze, I need! Where the hell is he?
Ah!
He's there!
You said he wasn't.
I don't understand.
Ah!
There, voilà.
Her, like so;
and him, like so.
César, I love you.
Oh!
Aaah!
Dismount!
César!
César!
Come!
Your Majesty!
Search the house and bring everybody to me.
Go, hurry!
Salluste!
What are you doing here?
Where's the Queen?
Did his Majesty receive my anonymous letter?
Where's the Queen?
Upstairs, Sire.
I'll show you.
Hurry.
Watch out!
Mmf!
So we agree, I rendered you a great service.
You repudiate the Queen and return my titles, my money, my Fleece.
Here we are.
Sire! You, here?
Wake up, Juanita, my little angel.
The King is here.
Oh, Sire!
Doña Juana, have you no shame?
Oh no, Sire!
And you, César, huh?
- Where's the Queen?
- The Queen, here?
She left for Bavaria, Sire, because of her papa is ill.
That's why Doña Juana and I... took the opportunity.
Tell me, Salluste.
That's enough.
You're in the room of a young girl.
Sire, Sire!
I'm no longer a girl.
- Marry us.
- No, hey!
Woah!
I mean...
Let me explain, Sire.
Let me see if I can.
There's nobody else. We searched everything. Only found these two.
Who are these two men?
Salluste!
Where is he?
Giddy up.
César.
Küssen Sie mich!
What did she say?
Kiss her, you fool.
Salluste!
Where are you going?
Nowhere, Sire.
I was looking for your Majesty.
So, Salluste... am I a cuckold?
Wait!
Wait!
Yalla!
Look who's coming.
Look who's there.
The Grandees!
Yalla!
Anyway, we're not going to rot here.
I have a little plan to escape.
We go back to Madrid.
We conspire together.
The King repudiates the Queen.
The old dame marries the parrot.
César becomes King.
I marry him and voilà, I'm the Queen!
Listen, Salluste, don't you notice your head swelling enormously sometimes?
Know what I mean?
What are you doing here then, my dear César?
His name is not César. It's Blaze.
The King said to me: "You have a choice. Either you marry Doña Juana, or it's the Berbers for you.
And?
And it's the Berbers.
Yoohoo!
César!
Oh no!
The old dame!
César!
César!
I'm here!
It's me!
Oh no!
Oh no, help!
Help!
César, wait for me, my love.

B-O-C-A.

Everybody`s gonna get well.

- Who knows?
- Where do you want it?

- Oh, shit.
This side.
Beat it!

If they don`t know you, it`s your ass.
- l thought I told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.
We`re goin` now. Good-bye!
Move ass.
Tell everybody we`ll be back in an hour.
Great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood.
Why don`t you detach us?
Give us a shot, at least till we find out if there`s anything here.
Everybody wants Weinstock.
Maybe here`s the lead we`re looking for. We deserve this.
You couldn`t burn a three-time loser with this garbage.
The man has done absolutely nothin`.
You`ll wind up in an entrapment rap.
Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs.
You put this hustler together with Weinstock and maybe we got a big score.
Big score, my ass!
At best he`s sellin` nickel-and-dime bags.
I wouldn`t be infringin` on your coffee break if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle, or have you forgotten about that already?
Jesus Christ, Jimmy, what`s happened to you guys?
Terrific.
But who?
What did you bring in?
A high-school kid in short pants that had a twitch?
You grab a bellhop because he`s got three joints in his sock?
Walter, we got the information there`s no shit on the street, right?
lt`s like a desert full ofjunkies waiting to get well.
Goddamnit, this could be it. This little candy-store guy, he`s put on a big show in a club with no narcotics connections.
They were all over him.
And after working a day and night, we tail him to Brooklyn.
And we sat on him for practically a week, and who do we come up with?
Joel Weinstock.
Now you gotta let us have it.
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What`ll it take?
- A wire.
No, two wires.
One on the store, one on the house.
You know I have to get a court order for a wire tap, don`t you?
- But you`ll try.
- We know you can do it, Walt.
Popeye, you still picking your feet in Poughkeepsie? J`entends parler de ça, Je n`arrive pas à y croire, Alors je vais un peu parler pour moi,
- Yes, it`s my first.
- Why did you choose to come by ship?
The next several weeks will be very difficult for me, and the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn`t ringing all the time.
Do you agree with the recent survey finding that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world?
Tout à fait, oui,
Here`s the warrants and the court order for the wire tap.
Judge gave you 60 days.
Mulderig and Klein`ll sit in for the feds.
They`ll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep `em informed of everything that goes down.
You know Doyle there, don`t you?
Yeah, I know Popeye.
His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
If this is the way you`re comin` in on this, why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?
- Because that`s my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
Bill, do me a favor, give them a chance.
He came in with a little basic information.
You worked with him, had some trouble, but don`t get off on the wrong foot.
- You have any problems, come to me.
- Simonson, just keep off my back.
Just try and cool it with him. lf you have any problems, come to me. l`ll handle him.
- l`ll be happy to work with him.
- He`s a good cop.
- He`s got good hunches once in a while.
- Fine.
Just keep him off my back.
Florida`s Mackel Brothers invite you to join the great escape, You can say good-bye to air pollution, commuting, high prices, rising taxes and cold, depressing winters, Mackel Brothers will show you the way to Florida and fresh, clean air,
Popeye.
- What?
- lt`s me, Cloudy. Open the door.
I can`t.
- What do you mean, you can`t? You all right?
- Yeah, l`m all right.

Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
Someone told me the reason why you do that is when you meet a chick and you rub up against her, she can`t tell you`re a cop.
I said it`s bullshit. lt`s gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin`.
Bill, why don`t you knock it off, huh?
He`s gettin` too far ahead.

He lives on four, he went up to six.
He`s cute, real cute.

Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.

- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
Why don`t you do the same, Doyle?
You look like shit.
Come on.

Thank you, Howard. Take what`s left there with you and good night.
Uh-uh.
Not that one.

A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.

Come on, the guy`s in a hurry.
He wants the bread. He wants to go back to France.
This guy`s not gonna play games.
Look, he`s one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across.
What am I, a schmuck?
What`s the hurry?
He could see a couple of shows, visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Don`tjerk me, Weinstock.
I spent a lot of time settin` this one up.
So what do you want, a badge?
This is your first major-league game, Sal.
One thing I learned: move calmly, move cautiously, you`ll never be sorry.
Look, l`ve been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin` all over you like fleas.
- He`ll take the deal somewhere else.
- Let him take it and find out how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash.
There`s no hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We can make the switch in an hour!

You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven`t spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a policeman.
Look, l`m levelin` with you.
I need a little more time.
My people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch, that`s all.
It has to be by the end of this week.

Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop.
Break it up!

That car`s dirty.

Nothin` here, Jimmy.
This is all solid.
There`s nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
I don`t buy that, Irv.
The stuff is in that car.
Well, you find it. I can`t.
Enfin on ne va pas passer la journée ici, Ça fait deux heures qu`on est là, Soyez patient, Look, the car was lost sometime last night.
First they send us to Pier One, then here.
Then what?
Why did you park the car down by the waterfront?
You`re staying in midtown Manhattan and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television.
He probably left the car to look at something.
We were told by the police commissioner that the car was brought to this garage.
- l demand its immediate return.
- You have to be patient.
We get four or five hundred cars here a day.
Monsieur Devereaux is an important guest of this country.
He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government.
Here are his credentials from the French consulate.
Unless you wish to see this in his film, I suggest you locate the car immediately.
You`re in a no-smoking area, sir. Would you please extinguish your cigarettes?
What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv?
4795 pounds.
You sure?
That`s what it was. 4795 pounds when it came into the shop.
Owner`s manual says 4675.
That`s 120 pounds overweight.
That`s still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy`s gotta be right.
Listen, I ripped everything outta there except the rocker panels.
Come on, Irv.
What the hell is that?
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
All right.
I got it for you, Randy.
Itjust came in from downtown.
- Who`s Devereaux?
- l am Mr Devereaux.
Why?
l`m sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it`s hard to keep track...
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah. lt`s right outside.
They stole it right off the street from you, huh?
Goddamn.
You`re gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know.
I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it.
Yeah, well, that`s New York.

Yes.
Where`s my car, please?
lt`s right over here.
You`re lucky this time. lt`s in perfect shape.

Anthony Pastrumo, one of the big five Mafia bosses in greater New York, is a strong family man known as Papa at home, known as Baccala in the family.
- How he know that?
- Go start the car.
Baccala has been known as Big Daddy of Brooklyn Vice ever since his best friend choked on a bullet while dining with him.
Oh, my, Hail Mary, mother of God pray for us sinners and blessed art thou among women.
Papa Baccala's establishment now seems threatened like so many old American institutions, by the generation explosion.
Attacking crime in the streets of New York Brooklyn DA Goodman expressed concern over the possibility of another gang war.
I am concerned over the possibility of another gang war.
If there is a gang war, it would be started by Kid Sally Palumbo and his gang from South Brooklyn.
It would jeopardize the comforts accumulated for 40 years since Baccala won his battle for power in the last Mafia war.
He lives in tranquil opulence amid his art collection on a Long Island estate.
Every day he leaves his loving wife, and like all of us hazards the risks of a highly competitive business world.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The drive from home to office takes only 40 minutes but it could be two different worlds.
Registered under the name of Joseph DeLauria his politician front man and legitimate factotum...
- Hey.
- Hey.
... Baccala's business empire is nestled near the Brooklyn docks.
The Lancer Trucking Company.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The Lancer Manufacturing Company.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The Lancer Printing Company.
- Hey.
- The Lancer Fur Company.
- Hey.
- Hey.
His executive vice president is the notorious gunman of the '30s Francisco Santos, better known as Water Buffalo.
- Hey, Water Buffalo.
Saint Anthony, let me make a good living today.
And listen up, please.
I wanna tell you something.
Baccala, he's on your side.
So don't pay no attention to these creeps like Kid Sal.
What's the weather like on TV?
Don't no mind.
You wear boots.
You know what?
You tell them you good people.
You no take no bullshit.
Can I use the mirror, just for a second?
Salvatore you watch you ass.
- Got them. I got them.
Hey, go get them, Sally Kid.
Yeah, tell that Baccala who we are.
- Yeah, she's wearing pants. - Yeah.
Angela!
What, you go to school like that?
- The whole world is short skirts.
- Yeah, the whole world.
Saint Anthony protect.
- You know what to do, Sally.
- I'll worry about Baccala.
- I got them!
- Go get them, Sal.
Don't screw around.
Kid Sally Palumbo runs the Red Hook section of South Brooklyn for his don, Baccala.
His lieutenants are Big Jelly Catalano, Tony the Indian Ezmo the Driver, and a dwarf known as Beppo the Dwarf.
- Damn it!
In the pecking order of the Mafia family Kid Sally's gang makes collections for Baccala.
There's little money to collect in Red Hook.
That is why the district attorney fears another gang war.
You, sit here, okay?
You, sit here, okay?
- You sit here, okay?
- I don't feel like sitting.
You sit.
I think I'm gonna stand.
What do you want?
- Do the right thing.
- What's the right thing?
We gotta go around with guns with loaded bullets and what do we get?
You get everything, we get ungotz.
You shut up your face!
You old guys used to be million-dollar movie stars on the late show and now you send your kids to West Point.
We go to West Point all right.
Sing Sing West Point.
What's this? We gotta do deuces and treys in the can for you and you leave your money for your kids.
You show some respect!
- I'm good people.
- You no act like good peoples.
I'm good people, and...
And I'm good people, and I take no bullshit.
So I do what's right.
What's right?
You and I now in business.
International World Championship six-day bicycle race.
Make a lot of money.
And patriotic too.
A bike race?
What's patriotic?
The Italians best goddamn bicycle riders in the world.
You don't know that?
Oh, that?
Yeah.
Sure, I know that.
Okay, now, Saint Anthony.
You see?
Baccala has a big heart.
I give this creep one last chance for you.
Just for you.
Then that's all.
Big, ain't it?
With seats and a track in the middle, it ain't so bad, maybe.
Oh, are these the plans?
I keep forgetting to oil myself.
There we go.
Thanks.
She acts up every time it rains.
You see, it's the rust, the rust.
Well, it looks okay.
Anybody asks me, I say everything's coming along pretty okay.
Hi.
You guys okay?
- Yeah, now, well, make a nice track, okay? - Okay.
- Yeah, we got things to do. - Okay.
Yeah, we gotta get to the airport.
The bike racers are coming in.
- DeLauria is gonna be there.
- How about that?
- That's pretty freaking famous.
- How come he gets all the headlines?
I gotta take a nap.

I am blind.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do your own work.
Salvatore.
What you do?
What?
What you do if a bike rider is looking to rob you?
- How?
- No matter how.
Only trust Christ and Holy Mother.
Anybody looks to rob me, I put them under the water.
Too late, after they rob you.
Who took my chocolate bar?
I wouldn't touch your goddamn chocolate bar.
- I left it there last night.
- It was almost gone.
I only had one bite.
Christ.
Is no good for teeth.
Salvatore?
You make sure no one robs you.
You lock them in the cages.
- How many bike riders we got?
Four, five, six, seven, eight nine, 10...
- I only got 11.
- That's right.
No kidding?
Yeah, but we need 12.
Well, it's gotta be big enough for a guy.
We're starting slavery.
No, you can't have that cage.
Not unless you take the lion with it.
Now we're home, baby.
- Look at the pussycat.

- Look at that, eight pounds of meat. - Yeah.
Wait till we feed him people.
Holy Mother, I give thee thanks.
Who's seen the TV Guide? Anyone?
A girl should knock before they come in.
It was open.
Christ, men.
You ever think anything like that about my sister I'll put your tongue on the third rail.
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, where'd you go?
I gotta talk to you.
I gotta talk to you.
Hey, will you...? Will you shut up and listen?
You listen to your brother.

Fancy.
For a party.
- What party?
- For my bike race.
You go.
- I got better things to do.
- So do I.
- What?
- Nothing.
Look, you go, smart-ass.
- Why?
- Because I say so.
You weren't invited, that's why.
Because Mr. DeLauria is ashamed to be seen in public with you, that's why.
I got the best thing I ever got going for me, and what do you know?
Wisecracks.
You find out it's time you're Kid Sally Palumbo's sister and act like it.
You get up off you ass.
You get dressed pretty.
Maybe you meet nice Italian boy.
From Italy.
- Hey, this place ain't bad.
- I'm not telling anybody.
- Hey. - It's our party, it's our bike race.
- Hey, you people can't come in here.
- We don't need no invite.
It's all right, ladies and gentlemen.
It's nothing. Don't worry.
I told you, go home.
You're not supposed to be here.
Two bimbos?
You can't come in here with them two.
I'm telling you, it's all right.
My mother lets me.
- Now, the sister.
- Let me get your jacket off.
- What are they doing?
- Give me that jacket, you dumb fuck.
Come on, give me that jacket.
Well, hello.
No, don't tell me, you're Angela.
- Angela who?
- That's very funny.
Have you seen what we have to eat?
Direct from the Della Palma.
I think there's a nice, quiet place over here.
Away from the noise. There's no crowd.
Honey, I want you to meet Mario Trantino.
Hey, you all alone?
That's no good.
Why don't you keep Mario company?
Am I supposed to make him buy me champagne?
She's got a great sense of humor.
My mother don't like me to get my shirt dirty when I eat.
Hide them.
They're not supposed to be here.
You wanna go eat?
- Eat.
You wanna go eat?
- Yeah.
- Fifty cents, sir.
- Here, I'll pay.
Nice.
Where you come from?
Calabria.
Most young people, they speak English?
- Young people, they go away.
- Here?
- Here is hard.
- Oh, I bet.
Must be a special something, you know?
If you win the bike race, is that "special something" enough?
Maybe.
World champion, what's specialer?
Money.
You want one?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I pay. - No, no, no.
I said, I said.

- Come on in.
Get in there.
What the hell is this?
It's not ready.
- He won't move the motor pool.
- How can they finish this thing?
- I don't do woodwork.
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, there'll be no race tonight.
Due to circumstances beyond our control, the race will be delayed.
You'll receive rain checks for Joseph DeLauria's World Championship Bike Race for some other night soon as it can be arranged with the management and the carpenters.
I'll kill the creep.
I'll kill him.
Salvatore!
You gotta watch your ass.
Let's get out of here before Baccala comes.
I should kill you, creep.
All of you.
You're out of business.
What you're gonna do is be my chauffeur.
And that's all you gonna do, creep.
You drive me to lunch.
You wait outside.
When I finish lunch, I come outside.
Then you drive me back here.
Every day you drive Baccala.
And that's all you do, creep.
Or else you are dead, creep.
Your plane leaves Kennedy at 4 p.m.
Your bus leaves East Side Terminal...
Is there a Mario Trantino registered here?
He's one of the Italian bike racers.
No, they've all checked out. Checked out.
- Hey. - They said you already checked out.
- Why didn't you leave a message?
- No, I didn't know you come.
- Going home? - No, no, I stay.
Some place, not here.
Because they want the deposit after 1.
- Where?
- I don't know.
Come on.
- Seventy-five bucks a month for this?
- A month in advance.
You should be ashamed.
Okay, you pay the gas and the electric.
- What name do you want on the mailbox?
- Trantino.
Mr. and Mrs?
- Any business of yours?
- Couldn't care less.
- I have to go.
- Oh, too bad.
- School.
I'm late.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You'll be okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You know people?
- You.
- That's all?
- I know name.
Very many name to call from Catanzia.
For Father Marsalano.
For the orphanage.
For the orphans.
I promise him.
There's a Laundromat up the block.
And around the corner, on Avenue B, there's a supermarket.
Thank you.
I have to run.
- Christ.
Hey, you come again, Angela, soon.
Yeah, soon.
- Hey, Angela, Angela.
- What?
Do you have a 10-cent piece for the telephone box?
Thank you.
- We gotta kill Baccala.
- We start with Water Buffalo.
So you wanna kill Water Buffalo?
Listen, I tell you how is best.
I'm late. Christ.
Can you give me a lift?
- Where are you going?
- Ocean Parkway.
Oh, forget it.
Every night he park his car on Ocean Parkway...
- Right. ...in the same place.
Come on. Come on, that's it.
Kick it in.
- Terrific, terrific.
- I'm doing it.
It's okay.
You watch your ass, dear.
Good morning.
He looks fine today.
Who could shoot if they could hit a baby?
The only guy I know who'd do that's Water Buffalo.
Bitch.
Shoot him in the shoes.
That dirty rat fink.
These are $ 110 Footjoys.
Well, these are 120-buck Johnson Murphies.
Where is he?
Boy, are we in trouble.
We could say we got him.
We come back tonight and hit him again.
Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute.
Ezmo ain't deaf.
He can hear nothing when it happens.
Come on.
Just like that.
Yeah, just exactly.
- Yeah, what else?
- I heard about a dozen shots.
We saw blood all over the wall.
Dripping.
And brains too.
Water Buffalo got no brains.
How'd they look?
Like lobster eggs with Fra Diavolo sauce.
That's the brain.
Would I lie?
No bodies.
Nothing in the Daily News.
No murders in the news.
A murder ain't in the Daily News, ain't no murder.
- What's this?
What do...? - Maybe nobody look yet.
Sally, maybe he's waiting to see if we do something stupid.
It could be.
If that's what it is, it better be.
I don't feel good.
I'm scared, Joey.
You don't believe me, huh?
Your own brother.
Hey, you was there.
I'll never forget the blood.
I told you we bombed that rat fink.
Well, there ain't enough left of Water Buffalo to make a ghost out of.
- Water Buffalo!
- Hey, they got Toregressa's wife.
- You know it.
The best professional mourner in South Brooklyn.
- It fits him good.
- Him?
No, we... We are twins.
It's a rare compliment indeed, an Italian priest who prefers our clothes.
Really, the way they're always raving about Roman tailors.
Now, what is your brother's address?
No, no, no.
I'm going to take with me.
No, I can't.
You see, our policy.
We just never give our clothes to anyone but a priest or a nun.
With all these imposters, you understand?
Yeah, of course.
It's a pleasure to serve someone who respects tradition.
The trousers.
- Do you have a vestment? A priest's...?
- A vestment?
Oh, yes, certainly, Mr. Marsalano. Yes.
We're old-fashioned.
Reactionary even, and proud of it.
You know, I actually saw two nuns buying off-the-rack in Klein's Basement.
Seriously, that kind of thing could put us out of business entirely.
Come in.
Where'd you get all this?
People help me.
- Where do you sleep?
- It does no matter.
It might.
Splinters, I mean.
Do you wanna go eat Chinese?
So tell me.
- With the orphans? - I meant...
- Yeah, it goes okay.
- Oh, what?
You go home then?
No, no, I stay.
How?
In some way, but...
- I stay.
- I hope.
Kid Sally, this is my cousin.
Willie Quarequio from Wilmington.
Quarequio means "happy death."
So nothing bad can happen to me, because I'm gonna have a happy death.
So don't worry.
Here, watch this.
I'm gonna blow this up now.
Hey, you do it with a radio, huh?
In-freaking-credible.
It's as simple as changing television programs, ain't it, Willie?
- Exactly.
We'll change the channels for Baccala.
From living to dead.
I just slip this under the car, and you push this button.
That's all.
And it rains Baccala all over Brooklyn.
Don't fool with the radio.
Don't push the button.
Sergeant, there's a guy here...
Funny, he was here just a minute ago.
He loaned me cigarettes when we were kids together.
Three.
They got three, and we ain't even on the scoreboard.
- We gotta get one back.
- I hope he had a happy death.
- Get Baccala.
- We need somebody right now.
- You handle it, Tony.
- He owed me 8 bucks.
We just go slow.
So far, it's nice.
Them other punks, they run around, they figure they're cowboys.
We just to go slow and we get every one of them.
And I strangle Kid Sally personal.
So long, Tony.
You want...? You want me to contribute, eh?
I know priests.
Well, a little contribute, no.
A big contribute, yes.
I got all ready, all ready.
Oh, yes. I got right here.
See, I got all stamped and addressed to Father Marsalano.
And I got 10 bucks in each one.
So that if we lose one, we don't lose all the money, see?
- I got.
- No, no, no, I mail.
Hey, excuse me?
Father Marsalano, he said that we walk to the mailbox together.
Together, yes.
You watch, I mail.
Me write.
This is my good friend, Baccala.
You go and see him.
You call me up.
I fix.
Hey, Padre.
Goodbye, Padre.
Laviano's gone.
Baccala won't meet him now.
Let's go.
You now, I know that priest from somewhere.
- They all look alike to me.
- Yeah?
Son of a bitch.
I get you out.
You go up.
I knock you ass off.
When you're broke, you're a joke.
You tell him we want our money, Sally.
Hello, Morton the Gambler?
What's doing, pal?
I won't mention who this is by name in case my phone is bugged.
Listen, Morton, don't you wanna see me with something?
Two hundred of yours. And we make the collections.
You gave it to who?
He gave it to Baccala.
Now we're gonna freaking starve to death, the bum.
Somebody's gotta housebreak that lion.
Christ, this is a disaster area.
Jesus.
I never dreamt of the lion going to the bathroom.
It smells so bad, I can't see.
It's like tear-gas with teeth.
Get your foot up, Big Jelly.
Come here, you bum.
Come here.
- He'll give out heart attacks.
- He'll get us the collections.
First, he needs a bath.
- Come on, baby!
- Get going.
- Come on, what a baby.
- That's it, come on.
Come on.
All right.
Hey, Ezmo, look out for your shoes.
All right, all right.
Yeah, I'm starting to put things together.
Well, I hope so.
I'm tired of going to funerals.
I am with you.
Baccala could give you a little and me a little, and never feel it.
But...
Gesundheit.
Fill it up.
Yell.
Scream.
Shout.
But don't get physical. Don't get physical.
Nice little pussycat.
- Are we friends?
- We're friends, you...
Friends.
Hey, while you're up there...
While you're up there, get me 10 pounds of Grade-A steak.
Yeah, honey.
Now, you stay right there, honey.
That's right.
Don't move, honey.
Really friends.
- Come on, baby. Come on.
- Good boy.
- That's right.
- Give him the bag of meat.
- Put the bag of money on the table. - Yeah.
- Here's the meat.
- Good boy.
Here, give me the meat.
Here you go, baby.
Did you see me?
When they hear what I'm doing to old Baccala...
They'll line up to kiss your tail longer than a two-dollar window at the track.
Bad bet.
At Baccala's funeral, they line the streets, hats off.
- Only it ain't for Baccala.
It's for me. - Yeah.
Riding in an open convertible right behind the hearse.
- Yeah. - Kid Sally Palumbo, new boss of the outfit.
- Let's count the moneys.
- Oh, my God, meat.
- Oh, crap.
- He's eating the freaking money.
- Thanks a lot.
In an exclusive interview with M.E. Landsman veteran underworld reporter Sergeant DiNardo of the NYPD Organized Crime Special Attack Unit pointed out that the murder victims had police records.
- Shit.
- Gesundheit, dear.
Do you know how many people die from rat bites and tenement fires?
- No, dear.
- I am up half the night doing something about the ghettos.
What hits the headlines?
Hoodlums who spare us the expense of burying them.
What?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm listening to this thing in Brooklyn.
Isn't that terrible?
Get me Commissioner McGrady.
- This is the mayor.
- Of course, dear.
Can you believe it?
He called before breakfast.
Who is it, Moe Landsman?
Listen, if they wanna shoot each other up God bless them all.
Can't they do it in Jersey?
It's this punk, Sally Palumbo.
He's pushing Baccala.
Well, get on it.
Get the mayor off my back.
You no take no bullshit.
- What could I tell you?
- What could I tell you?
- What could I tell you?
- I don't understand.
- What?
- I don't understand.
- What?
- I don't under...
- What?
What? - I don't understand!
- You mean you don't wanna talk.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
About your brother's business.
I don't know.
It doesn't seem fair.
Nice girl like you...
You got a right to know what kind of murdering bastards you come from.
That's Kid's sister.
Would you believe, a college student?
She's a pretty girl.
The media will be pleased.
- Now, there she comes.
- She's coming.
There she is.
There's Angela.
Coming down the steps.
See if I can interview her.
Have you ever been arrested?
We just wanna hear the other side.
- I want to interview you myself.
- Are you gonna be there with him?
Kid Sally Palumbo's kid sister, Angela, isn't saying anything.
Typical of the kind of reception we've had from these people.
We're going back inside, Sandy.
You don't keep anything to eat?
No.
Get dressed.
I mean, I can't leave you here like this.
Come home and get something to eat with me.
Home?
Oh, and if anybody asks you, remember you ran into me after school, okay?
The Brooklyn police rounded up the Kid Sally Palumbo gang in a lightning midnight raid in what crusading Brooklyn DA Goodman described as an all-out war to free the city of Mafia control.
In the rain, during the early hours of the morning, our TV camera caught these rare shots of Angela Palumbo, a student at NYU, sister of Kid Sally sometimes rumored to be the link between the Palumbo gang and underground campus terrorists.
I make him watch while I shoot her.
Punk.
Kid Sally's comment to the media was eloquent though illiterate.
His lieutenants had little more to add to what their captain had said.
Hey, where's me?
- Oh, there I am.
- Way to go, Beppo!
You were very good.
The only extended statement came from the long-time matriarch of the waterfront Mafioso Big Momma Ferraro, grandmother of Angela and Salvatore Palumbo.
Come on, come on, let's go.
I told him good.
You rotten, maligno bastard.
You Jew, son in a bitch, monkey cop.
You * * * * * * * *!
I no say "bleep." Is a lie.
I no say "bleep." I say, "You, you're sucker!"
I know, I know.
Where you been?
This is Mario Trantino.
He's one of the boys who came here for the bike race.
- How do you do?
Pleased.
- Pleased, pleased to you.
How do you do, please.
You sit.
I change.
I'm gonna change.
That guy is a fake priest on a make for your sister.
- Who fake priest?
- Where's Ezmo the Driver?
Me and him seen him in his priest suit by Dominic's.
We could've touched him.
- Priest, huh? - Hey...
What's going on here?
Call Angela.
- Mama, please, please.
Angela.
- I got him, I got him.
Give me his hand.
I cut off fingers a priest gets anointed.
Hold his hand.
Pull his fingers out.
- You leave hand there.
- Someone call the police.
Stop it.
Put it on the table.
No, no.
Please, please. No, no.
I never touch.
On my mother's grave, I never touch.
That means he touch.
Put it on the table, and I cut it off.
Look, look, look.
I get money for church orphan.
Look, I got the name.
Dominic Laviano, he give me name.
Baccala.
He give me name.
Hold it. Hold it.
- You got money from Dominic Laviano?
- Yeah, I send to Catanzia.
This Baccala you are close?
Dominic Laviano, he fix to meet.
This is a good boy, Angela.
Calabrese ain't Sicilian, maybe, but it's good blood.
Sit.
Dominic Laviano fix you to meet Baccala?
Good.
- You meet.
- I meet.
- You meet, we shoot.
- I no meet.
Wait.
Listen, no shoot.
- What?
- Kidnap Baccala, get the moneys.
- He's got?
- A whole roomful.
- Forget the money.
Shoot.
- Get the moneys, then shoot.
- You meet?
- You meet.
We no shoot.
You no meet, we shoot you.
I meet.
We need license plates and new sign for truck clean guns and nice white coats for deliver fish.
You hear me, Salvatore?
All these details drive me crazy.
- Is detail make sauce...
- Make the sauce rich, I know.
Look, stealing license plates is Beppo the Dwarf's department.
Stealing guns department is Junior and Jerry the Booster.
And Big Jelly takes care of everything I forgot to mention.
All right?
Now you know what to do.
So go do.
Or do I gotta do everything myself?
I've gotta relax so I can think clear.
That's my department.
We snatched the bartender.
They're expecting you to fill in.
Your name's Scuderi.
Here's 500.
A thousand more in three days.
Here's the Mickeys.
Make sure Baccala's guys drink them and make sure they're out cold when we get there.
It better be right, baby.
Three, three.
Can I help you fellas?
Not right now.
Oh, here's the padre.
He's coming. Yes.
Hi, Padre.
This is my good friend, Baccala.
I mean, Signore Anthony Pastrumo Sr.
- This here is...
- Don Mario Trantino.
Don Mario Trantino.
Please, sit, Padre.
Well, now I will bless this table and all who eat at it.
- You say one prayer more.
- Certainly, certainly.
You say a prayer that all peoples who don't like Baccala will get cancer.
- You like shrimp and clams oreganata?
- Yes, yes, we like.
- You like?
- Oh, yes, I like.
- Then we have spaghetti alla Carbonara.
- All right, all right.
- Then we have veal alla Marsala.
- Good.
- Good?
- Good.
- And for vino...
- Soave Bolla.
Soave Bolla.
How about you boys?
- No.
- Better chill another one, huh?
- You hear my confess?
- Oh, yes, yes.
When you hear this confess you give me absolution.
Oh, absolutely, absolute, yes.
Now, if in this confess, I no tell you everything you still put me in heaven?
Guarantee?
A man of such bearing no tell.
This don't mean you lie.
You know, maybe you just forget, huh?
Young priests, they're the best. They're the best.
These old geepos, they say, "Baccala, you go away."
Besides I just peek up this little girl's dress.
I no touch.
Oh, well, you are a man of honor.
Fish.
These bullets sure fit tight. For bullets.
Those bums are still sitting in the window.
What the hell's he doing?
Give me a screwdriver.
- Hey, give me one too.
- Right.
All right, punks.
Now, bottoms up.
Come on.
Bring the glasses down to the bar slowly.
Keep your hands on the bar.
And no tricks.
Why don't you watch where you're going.
- Hey, get rid of her.
- Go bother someone else, lady.
- When I finish.
- Come on, we're working here.
- Come on.
- Black bitch.
- Yeah. - Nigger whore.
- Yeah. - Fat cop.
You know, you should've been a cop. Yes.
Because your father is a police dog, you fat mother...
No, no, no!
A miracle!
- What happened?
- The freaking gun broke.
Damn.
Move over.
Shoot him in the teeth.
Don't shoot.
I wanna have some fun with this one.
A miracle!
Oh, I love you.
A miracle, yes!
Fantastic!
Fingerprints.
I want it clean, I want it neat, I want it thorough.
- Witnesses?
- Yeah.
- A miracle.
What can I tell you?
- You didn't recognize Palumbo?
No, I swear before my confessor.
And you, Father?
What could I tell you?
What they're trying to tell you is they know confessions are privileged.
- Look...
- We was in the little boys' room.
We was in the little boys' room.
All right, what did you see?
See, what?
What I can see like this?
You think I got eyeballs in my asshole?
Give me a piece of rope.
I'm gonna get something out of this freaking day.
He's having a freaking heart attack.
- Freaking rat lion killed him.
- Just when we were gonna say something.
This guy was never any fun in his whole life and he just proved it.
Well?
I just got the most incredible idea how we could do it so as Water Buffalo would enjoy it himself even.
He's gonna be the first guy to ever come off the Verrazano Bridge.
Thank you.
And God bless you, my children.
Hot damn, that little priest's a real pistol.
Hey, I made a miracle. I made a miracle.
- I know.
- Oh, no, I did. I did, you know.
- I know.
- No, I was so scared I was praying.
- Yeah? - Yeah, I was praying to Saint Christopher.
- Then I remember he's no saint.
- Yeah, but he made a miracle.
Oh, yeah.
And also, you know, Baccala is going to give me lots of money.
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah, no, no.
See, because he tell me a secret telephone, you know?
Oh, listen, Mario. Listen.
Big Momma said, "No play the priest no more."
Take care.
If Kid Sally knew, Baccala, the FBI, or immigration...
My greenhorn, if they don't kill you, they'll send you home.
So look, you come too.
You know, tomorrow, Baccala he going to give Mario a whole room full of money, you know.
So tomorrow, we go back to Italy we become rich, we become famous American turista, huh?
I wish.
Maybe.
But I don't know.
My greenhorn.
God knows what you really know.
Did you bring the priest's clothes with you from Italy?
Leased?
I leave a home that's no home.
I come here for a race that's no race.
What do I do?
You know all I want.
Money.
No, no, no.
To stay.
You know, you have eyelashes as long as a girl's?
I wonder what a room full of money look like.
Like a bank.
- Hey, you guys all right?
- He just drank too much.
What could I tell you?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
I don't know if it belongs to the harbor patrol or Staten Island or Manhattan. I don't know.
Hello?
No, this is his wife.
It's up to the mayor now.
This drops it squarely in the lap of Gracie Mansion.
Oh, Mr. Goodman, could he call you back, please.
Well, well, he's in the bathroom.
Throwing up, I think.
Wait.
Listen, go back.
- Wait. I come soon, eh?
- I can't.
There's so much trouble.
I have to go home. I have to.
- No, no.
Go home no more.
- I don't know.
I don't want you with the trouble.
Nevermore.
Wait.
You buy something if you need, okay?
- Hey, I'm taken. I'm taken.
- Hold it, Mario, police officers.
Come on, Mario.
After weeks of bloodshed on the streets of New York the mayor is about to bring the forces of authority into action against the Mafia.
Tactical units of the Police Department are converging on a small street on the South Brooklyn waterfront.
Somewhere on that street, the infamous Kid Sally Palumbo Gang is lying in wait.
The gang, which declared war on the streets of Brooklyn against the forces of gang boss Anthony Pastrumo, a.k.a. Baccala.
Somewhere on that street is Sandy Vanocur ready to describe the day to you.
It's a beautiful day for the raid here on the South Brooklyn docks.
In the background, you can see the Verrazano Bridge where Water Buffalo was first buried.
Marshall Street this morning looks like a Western street on a television-studio backlot just before the final shootout.
Crusading DA Goodman had scheduled the raid on Kid Sally's headquarters for 9:00 but one major television network has been held up.
Gallagher, our watches still running?
- Will you give us a break? Back up.
- No, no, that's all right.
You know, if we wait much longer, Baccala will beat us to it.
Goddamn it, I got a lunch date with the mayor.
I was hoping to hand him Palumbo's head on a platter.
They're coming now.
Oh, thank God.
Let's get this show on the road.
All right, men, don your equipment.
Keep yourselves separated.
Let's move!
It's clearing up here and the rains seem to have washed away some of the shipyard smog.
I think we're just about ready...
Yes, yes.
The police juggernaut is moving in.
Assistant Chief Inspector Cornelius Gallagher will probably carry the ball for the police but we don't have any inside information from the Kid Sally group.
I have here a warrant for the arrest of Salvatore, a.k.a. Kid Sally, Palumbo Mrs. Catherine, a.k.a. Big Momma, Ferrara and 55 John Does.
I command all those mentioned by name to surrender peacefully or be prepared to face the consequences.
Here, you better have this.
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move. Stay right there.
Don't move.
Put your hands up.
Didn't your mother teach you to knock?
- Advise them of their rights.
- Rights?
- I wanna see the DA.
- I'm the DA.
- You don't look like a DA.
- All right, come on, come on.
Come away, Kid.
Let's go, come on.
For the sake of our viewers, I wonder if we could have a repeat of you charging in the office without your mask.
- This way, people could see who you are.
- Oh, right on.
My name is not John Low, dummy.
I wanna see my lawyer.
Tell me, what is that?
Marijuana.
I'm allowed.
I'm a high school student.
Carry me, daddy.
Anytime you're ready, Mr. Goodman.
Palumbo!
Palumbo!
Go get him, Sally.
What's the matter?
Come here, you bum.
Let's go, come on.
Let's get up.
Let's go.
Come on, attaboy.
That's right, go on.
- Did you advise him of his rights?
- Of course.
- You don't want a lawyer?
- I don't know.
You can make one phone call.
- Mr. Baccala.
I want to call.
- Later. Later.
He's attending a funeral at the moment.
You got a passport?
Do you want the sister as a defendant?
You're goddamn right I want her.
She's great for the media.
I might even be able to link her up with student violence.
All right, you got her.
Put him in front of the grand jury.
I'll have to offer him immunity.
You can pay his fare home as far as I'm concerned.
You're in serious trouble, Mario Trantino, do you know that?
Inspector Gallagher here wants to put you in jail.
Jail.
- Me?
For what?
- Impersonating a priest.
Conspiring to commit murder, grand theft, perjury, you name it.
What must I do?
Tell the truth.
That's all.
Mario you like America?
- Wanna stay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, that's what this country stands for.
It's a place where people can speak the truth without fear.
One nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.
Mario you know what a grand jury is? - No.
Well, the way it works is, we'll go into a room where nobody can see you and you tell the jury the truth.
- Who know what I say?
- Nobody.
You, me, and the jury.
Grand jury testimony is secret.
- Like a confession is privileged?
Yeah, pretty cute.
Hey, what about Angela?
She get into trouble?
Did she help plan the murder?
Let me be frank.
If you agree to do this we have a right to expect complete honesty.
Don't we?
- Hi.
- Who?
- You know.
- Let's go.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mario Trantino a professional bicycle racer from Catanzia, Italy.
Mario, do you know Angela Palumbo?
No, no, relax.
Answer in English.
What are you saying to me?
Ladies and gentlemen, he speaks English perfectly well.
Well, he said "mother." I know that.
I thought this was to be a cooperative witness, Mr. Goodman.
You can go home now.
No grand jury.
- Why?
- I guess somebody changed his mind.
- Who?
- My guess is your boyfriend.
What's that supposed to mean?
Your boyfriend refused to testify against you.
He got thrown out of the country.
Five o'clock... out on the first plane.
And Goodman lets you go.
Figure it out.
Is there a Mario Trantino on a Rome flight today?
No, I'm sorry.
Why don't you check with Pan Am?
- Pan Am?
- It's over there.
- Excuse me? - Yes, sir.
Just a minute, please.
Is there a Mario Trantino on a Rome flight today?
Just a moment.
Nobody sees this guy.
Look, why don't you go to the observation deck?
And don't say I said anything.
Another day in the city of New York:
One full-grown male lion loose on the streets a successful raid by New York's Finest a grand-jury hearing, and the deportation of an Italian bicycle rider.
Go start the car.
This morning, the entire Palumbo mob pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder Brooklyn.
They were sentenced to a year apiece in jail.
Oh, my, Hail Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners. Amen.

Bare-ass naked with his socks still on?
-Yeah, they do it like that up North.
-What for?
Protective purposes?
-Ask me?
-Ask Jack.
It's his old stamping ground.
Must be a bloody contortionist.
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
We don't want you to go up to the North, Jack.
You work for us, Jack.
You know we're connected with the Newcastle mob.
I'd hate you to screw it up.
What's that, a python?
What are you going for?
To find out what happened.
Look, your brother's dead and gone.
They're hard nuts up there, Jack.
They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his nose in.
-Too bad.
-Remember, they're killers. Just like you.
The police seem satisfied.
Since when was that good enough?
Think again, Jack.
I will.
Pint of bitter.
In a thin glass.
Is there a Mr. Carter in the room?
Yeah.
Hello?
Margaret?
Why the hell aren't you here?
What time?
Is Doreen at the house?
Who's with him, then?
When can I see you?
Will you be there tomorrow?
Now listen--
-I won't be using the room tonight. -I see.
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
-It's not like that, love.
-It never is.
-Are you a traveler?
-Definitely.
-Will this do?
-Yes.
Very nice.
I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Don't be bloody silly.
You're the first since Monday.
-You sure?
-Sure.
I'll bet this has seen some action, hasn't it?
I'll give you the key when you come down.
Was he in bad shape?
They come worse.
Doreen. All right, are you?
Been staying with a friend?
I'm sorry about your father.
Tell me, Doreen did the police say anything?
They said he was drunk.
How's school?
I left last year.
-What are you doing now?
-Working at Woolworth's.
-That must be very interesting.
-Yes.
What are you going to do?
Live with Margaret?
Well, why won't you come with us to South America?
My fiancée won't mind, and that's how your Dad would have liked it.
Get Hubert up, will you?
We're ready now, sir.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, you know.
-Nice of you to come.
-No, Frank was a good bloke.
-He was that.
-One of the best.
-I couldn't believe it when I heard.
-What?
I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.
He was always on time.
-Did you work with him, Keith?
-At the Half Moon.
It's a bloody funny thing, you know.
You work with a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus.
Then he goes and does a thing like that.
A bloody funny thing.
"Will you all stand up, please."
"For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God...
"...of his great mercy to take unto Himself...
"...the soul of our dear brother here departed...
"...we therefore commit his body to be consumed by fire...
"...in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life...
"...through Our Lord Jesus Christ...
"...who shall change the body of our low estate...."
-Is that Margaret?
-Yes.
"Who shall change the body of our low estate...
"...that it may be like unto His glorious body...
"...according to the mighty working, whereby He is able to subdue...
"...all things to Himself."
I thought you weren't coming.
Changed me mind.
Everything go off all right, then?
Fine.
I want to talk to you.
-What about?
-Doreen.
She's nothing to do with me.
What do you mean?
You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off.
You're closer to her than anyone.
No, it's not like that.
I've got a husband, you know.
Hold it. Hold it.
Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Killed?
I don't know anything about it.
Really?
I must go.
I'm in a hurry.
I want to talk to you later.
-I can't.
-Tomorrow morning, then?
Well, all right then.
12:00 on the Iron Bridge.
Well, absent friends.
You don't suppose he might have done it on purpose?
What?
You mean, kill himself?
No. Frank, kill himself?
Get away.
I mean, what for?
-That's what I was wondering.
-Come off it.
Frank was, well, straight.
He had no worries I know of. It would have showed.
Why would it?
It just would, that's all.
Frank was always the same.
Since when did Frank drink whisky?
-I don't know. -No.
Nobody seems to know.
He was a bloody good bloke.
One of the best.
How would you know? Or you?
Or you?
None of you knew.
I knew.
He was me dad.
Okay. Let her go.
-I'm sorry about that.
-Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
-Let's have another drink.
-No, I must be off. I should be at work.
-Get your suit cleaned.
-That's all right.
Come on.
Thanks for coming, Eddie.
Frank was a good bloke.
It's the least I could have done.
-Do you work here, Keith?
-Yeah.
If anyone comes in and asks for me...
-...you let me know, right?
-Yeah, all right.
I'm at the Las Vegas behind the dance hall.
Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Yeah, he comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
Today? At the races.
He always goes.
How come you know Albert?
I went to school with him.
He'll know what's going on in this town.
Grey suits you, Eric.
-Good God.
-Is He?
-Jack. Jack Carter.
-Eric. Eric Paice.
What are you doing around here?
-Didn't you know this is my hometown?
-No, I didn't know that.
Funny, that.
Thanks.
So what're you doing then?
On your holidays?
-No, I'm visiting relatives. -That's nice.
It would be if they were still living.
Meaning what?
-Bereavement, death in the family.
-I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
-Small world, isn't it? -Very.
-So who you working for these days, Eric?
-I'm straight.
Respectable.
What're you doing?
Advertising Martini?
-You've been watching television.
-Yeah.
Come off it, Eric.
Who is it?
Brumby?
Kinnear?
What's it to you, anyway?
I've always had your welfare at heart, Eric.
Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be, is it?
And you should know.
-If I remember rightly. -Oh, yes.
So, you're doing all right then, Eric.
-You're making good.
-Making all right.
Good prospects for advancement, is there?
A pension?
Do you know? I'd almost forgotten what your eyes look like.
They're still the same.
Piss-holes in the snow.
-Still got a sense of humor. -Yeah.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.
Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Can't say I do.
Don't miss the start on my account.
-Carter's here.
-Where?
-I don't know.
-You stupid shit.
You see what it's like these days, Jack?
-You can't get the material.
-Yes, I can see your problem, Mr. Kinnear.
-Sit down, Jack. -Thank you.
I could weep, I really could.
Sometimes I think I'll retire just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them.
Glenda, get Jack a drink.
-What is it, Jack?
-Scotch, please.
Piss off, Ray.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Do you know I never knew he worked in one of my places?
It's funny that. Neither did I.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Harry.
Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them.
Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in these piddling little glasses. Give him the bloody bottle.
Now where are we?
-I think I'll stay as I am.
-You're bluffing, you bastard.
That's what you pay to find out.
Right, Jack?
Right.
If you can afford it.
Thought you were going soon.
Soon.
When you've lost your money. Won't take long.
-Clever sod, aren't you?
-Only comparatively.
Harry, I don't like to push but could you let us know how much your hand's worth?
I'm taking two.
Do you know Sid Fletcher?
What?
I work for him.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
£100.
What's that?
£100?
That's right, Harry.
Your £100 and another £100.
-I know him, too.
-Another £100.
-Who?
-Sid Fletcher.
-£25 notes of the realm.
-Do you?
-Do you really know Sid Fletcher?
-£200, and another.
I know Sid Fletcher.
What's that?
£200.
I'll follow that.
£200.
Yes, I met him last year.
-All right, and another £200.
-Oh, yes. When he came up on business.
-Really?
-I don't know, what shall I do?
He came to see Mr. Kinnear.
-Is that £200?
-Did he?
That's right, Harry.
You can always see me if you want to.
Didn't he, Mr. Kinnear?
All right, your £200 and another £200.
What's that?
£600, Harry.
£200 to follow you, and I've raised it £400.
-£400?
-That's right, Harry.
You're not seeing me?
No.
All right, I'll see you.
-Calling my bluff, are you Harry? -Yeah.
We went about together.
Really?
While he was here.
While he was here, you went about together.
He was here for four days.
-Was he?
-About.
Would you do me a favor?
Yeah, I'll do you a favor.
Would you please put my glass on the table?
Come on, Harry.
I haven't won, have I?
Go on you're pulling my leg.
What about that, Jack?
-Old Harry thought I was having him on.
-Shut up.
Not going, Jack?
I have to. Things to do.
Of course.
Any time, just drop by.
Yeah, I'll do that.
I told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Jack, I didn't like that.
-You should've told me who you work for.
-Cyril didn't like it, either.
-So it's all girls together, is it?
-He thinks Sid and Gerald won't like it when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
He's right.
Tell him to save the money on the phone call.
What do you want?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
-This is my brother's car. -All right.
Well, he drove it into the river.
-Was the steering faulty? -No.
-What about the brakes? -Fine.
Nothing wrong with them.
How did it happen then?
He was drunk, drunk as a lord.
-What you having, Jack?
-Large scotch.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey?
-Haven't seen him in a long time.
-That's what he was saying about you.
He said he'd heard you were up in town, wondered if I knew you were staying.
He wants to look you up, old time's sake.
That's nice.
What did you tell him?
-Nought.
-Good lad.
See you later.
-Where you off?
-Las Vegas.
Come over.
-You all right now?
-Yeah.
-Are you coming to South America?
-No.
Where you going to live then?
At me friend's house.
-Well, where's that?
-Wilton Estate.
They're a nice family, are they?
Churchgoers and all that?
Good.
I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll be seeing you again.
Here.
-Go and get your hair done.
-Thanks.
Be good.
And don't trust boys.
That was left for you this evening.
What is it?
-My brother Frank.
-Is he staying the night?
Funny.
Can I phone London?
It'll cost you.
Hello?
I miss you.
I fancy you.
I wish I was touching you right now.
Making love to you.
I want to stroke you and kiss you all over.
Where are you?
In the bedroom.
My black underwear.
The sexy silk ones?
Take your bra off.
Stop it, darling.
No.
Go on.
Now hold them gently...
"...slowly..." "...imagine it's me."
When we're in South America... "...we'll make love in the sun."
Roll over.
"Make love again."
"And again."
With me.
"I really fancy you."
What's the matter, you got gut trouble or something?
No, darling.
Just doing my exercises.
Listen, Janet, Gerald's just walked in.
I must ring off.
Yeah, I'll come tomorrow.
Save it till Sunday.
I'll be back then.
That'll be for me.
Thorpe! They were waiting for us in the car park.
-How many? -Four of them.
-Jack?
-Good evening.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
-That's nice.
-The confidential like.
You stay in the car, I'll come and listen.
What do you want to tell me?
I've been asked to give you this.
Train goes four minutes past 12:00.
You've just got time.
That's very kind of somebody.
Who do I have to thank?
What happens if I miss the train?
-I've been asked to make sure you don't. -Oh, really?
You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
Let's stop pissing about.
Are you coming, Jack?
It'd be best.
Righto, lads.
Don't worry about him!
Thorpey!
Hello, Keith.
Stay there, Thorpey.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
-I'm sorry.
-You don't look it. -No.
Really, I am.
-Don't pull that bloody flannel with me.
If you're a traveler, I'm bloody Twiggy. And who's he?
Are you still at it?
Have you no thought for others?
-We're going inside.
-Why should I give the room to your sort?
-Upstairs, the door on the right.
-Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.
They knew there'd be trouble when you moved in.
-You keep your trap shut, Ma.
-I'll send the old man to see you.
And wouldn't he love it.
Where do you think you're going?
Why don't you make us all a nice cup of tea?
What are you going to do?
Make us a cup of tea and I'll tell you.
I might even let you watch.
-I'll call the police. -No, you won't.
Well, now, Thorpey.
It seems that I've got a secret benefactor.
That's nice, isn't it?
There's only one trouble.
I don't know who to thank.
Now I want to know who it is, Thorpey.
All right.
If you like, Thorpey, we'll stop mucking about.
Somebody doesn't want me poking my nose into something and I happen to know what that something is.
Now stand up.
Who paid you to see me off?
Well, I can't, Jack! How can I?
-Yes, you can.
-Don't, Jack, don't!
Who sent you?
Brumby.
There we are, you see?
Now you could tell me, couldn't you?
Quickly.
Edna, come in.
Join the tea set.
-Who's Brumby?
-Cliff Brumby?
Ever been to Westsea?
Ever been in an arcade there and put a penny in a slot machine?
Well, 10-to-1, it belongs to Cliff Brumby.
Like as not the bloody arcade as well.
Right along the coast.
Isn't that right, Thorpey?
-Where's he living these days?
-He's got a new place at Burnham.
-Address?
-On Durham Road.
The pantiles.
Suppose you tell me what the hell is going on!
It's my house.
Yes, Edna, I must say, I think you've been great about--
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Can I go?
You must be joking.
Keep him away from the telephone.
-I'm going out.
-Now, just a minute!
Don't let on I told you, for God's sake.
Jesus wept!
Now, Cliff, don't get mad.
I'll murder the little bitch!
-Daddy!
-That's right, bloody Daddy.
I wasn't expecting you until 3:00.
This is what you call having a few friends over for coffee?
Running riot over my bloody furniture!
Spewing all over my bloody goldfish!
Good evening. Sandra!
Where do you want--
The front door is open.
Who are you?
I'm an old friend of Cliff's.
I want to see him. It's urgent.
-What's it about?
-Business.
I know all about Cliff's business.
Yeah, well, tell him the Fletcher's sent me.
What the hell is this? Do you know the time?
-It's 2:00 in the morning!
-I know.
The Fletcher's sent you.
What is so important it can't wait till the morning?
I'm not in the mood for playing silly buggers.
I made a mistake. -What?
-I made a mistake!
-What about? -Never mind.
-It's not business? -See you.
I don't like it when some nut comes pushing in and out of my house at night.
Bloody well tell me who sent you!
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape.
With me it's a full-time job.
Now behave yourself.
Goodnight, Mrs. Brumby.
You sod!
They came back?
No.
Look at this, you bastard.
You don't care a stuff, do you?
I'll buy you another one.
What about the lad?
They took him away.
What'll they do to him?
Don't ask me.
They bloody hurt me.
You're lucky.
They kill as well.
And what about you?
Did you kill Brumby?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
-What about him?
-What you going to do?
-Pension him off.
-You're a bastard.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
So shut up!
What's that gun doing in your room?
Suppose I phone the police, told them there's a bloke in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You wouldn't do that.
How do you know I wouldn't?
'Cause I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
Are you awake?
No.
Do you want breakfast?
You must be joking.
I never eat breakfast.
Did you sleep well?
Did you sleep well?
Yeah.
Yes, thank you.
Are you tired?
No.
Are you tired?
No, I'm not tired.
Do you eat breakfast?
Put us in it, Jack.
Don't let us interrupt you.
I might have guessed.
Sorry about this, Jack. Orders are orders.
What orders would they be?
Gerald phoned us up in the middle of the night.
He'd heard you'd been making a nuisance of yourself.
We've got to take you back to London.
He said it'd be doing him a big favor.
We know you're all steamed up, so do Gerald and Sid.
But they have to be diplomatic.
Take me back to London.
Jack, don't you think you ought to get dressed first?
Come on, Jack, put it away.
You know you won't use it.
The gun, he means.
Out! Out!
If Anna could see you now.
Now, Jack, be reasonable.
You know we're going to take you back sooner or later.
Out!
Mind you don't catch cold, Jack.
I hope she's got understanding neighbors.
We'll see you when you've got your drawers on.
Do me a favor, will you?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
-No chance of that.
-Not much. -They're friends of mine.
-And that'll make me feel better?
Now I don't want to get rough, do I? Take that.
Out the back door.
Hold it!
Where do you think you're going?
Strawberry fair.
In.
Turn right.
Open that door and go inside.
-What are you going to do?
-Sit in the car and whistle "Rule Britannia".
-You're coming back?
-How could I stay away?
Where were you?
Bollocks!
Keith in?
What happened to you then?
How did you find me?
They give you a rough time?
No, you bastard!
You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't.
Does Albert Swift still live across the ferry?
Get knotted.
All right.
I want to square things with you.
Oh, yeah?
How? Stuff it!
My girlfriend's coming from Liverpool tonight.
Nice surprise, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Here, get yourself a course in karate.
Frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right!
You even screwed his wife, didn't you?
The poor bastard didn't even know if the kid was his!
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more?
Just another fella?
Nicer than most.
-Just another fella though, wasn't he?
-Yes.
-Even though he was nicer than most?
I can't help the way I am.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly.
I like that.
Once a week. You like a gentleman, do you?
Look, I'm me. Right? We are what we are, like it or not.
Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him.
Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both.
He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street.
I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him anymore.
It was getting too dodgy.
That was Sunday.
He said he'd kill himself.
I was frightened what you might do.
I don't believe you.
Frank wasn't like that.
I'm the villain in the family, remember?
It's the truth.
It is, honestly.
You bloody whore.
Frank was too careful to die like that.
Now who killed him?
I don't know nothing.
The only reason I came back to this crap house was to find out who did it.
I'm not leaving till I do.
Do you understand?
Hello, Jack.
You bitch!
It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it?
Peter's very upset about his car.
He's going to shit all over you.
I'll catch up with you, Margaret.
-You bastard!
-Come on, get me!
Over here, Jack.
Peter! Peter!
What the hell's she doing?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
No, frankly, I didn't know that.
A fairy godmother all of your own.
Yeah.
So, where are we going, Princess?
To the Demon King's Castle, of course.
Of course. Where else.
How did you know where I'd be?
You were seen parking your car.
The Demon King waved his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him.
Lucky for you, I waited.
Very lucky, I should think.
You're drunk.
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
He was.
He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
What was that?
We're there now.
Thank God.
A new venture of mine.
It's going to be a restaurant.
Do you like it?
Yes.
Very nice.
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around seeing as you weren't very forthcoming.
It seems you're concerned about the death of your brother.
I got to thinking how nice it would be if the bloke you was after was the same bloke I wanted off my back.
You know my life: machines the arcades.
It's a nice business.
It runs itself.
People put money in. I take it out.
There's not much rough stuff.
It's a business that makes me very happy.
Recently, though, I've had a spot of bother.
One of my lads gets a bit overanxious and flogs some machines to a club that has already got some.
The upshot is I've got to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.
As far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not.
These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good thing to take over the whole of my outfit, so I'm worried.
I can't fight them. I don't have that sort of a setup.
But I've got to fix them before they fix me.
The trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
£5,000,000.
That belongs to you.
Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
What name?
Kinnear.
Cyril Kinnear.
Kinnear did it.
Why?
I don't know.
All I know is there were people shitting bricks at his place last Saturday.
Your brother's name was mentioned.
Next day, he was dead.
Why?
-I don't know.
That's all I was told.
-That's not good enough.
Christ!
Do me a favor.
Do you really think I'm going to fix Kinnear on your say-so?
Just because they put me onto you last night?
Don't think you can play the same trick.
Stroll on.
Jack, you're wrong.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Brumby.
-Jack!
Who is setting you up in this place?
Brumby.
-Is he coming here?
-Don't worry.
He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
He won't.
He thinks I'm simple.
Why does he want that great big country place for?
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
Now you're asking.
Does Brumby really enjoy that crap?
Especially when I play the lead.
Did Kinnear say anything about me after I left the other night?
That's why you waited for me?
No, not entirely.
You're sure about that?
Sure, I'm sure.
You bastard.
Glenda!
I'm in the bath.
I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl.
Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
-It is one of Kinnear's films?
-Yeah.
Who set it up?
Eric?
Yeah.
Then he must have pulled her.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother?
What are you talking about?
You lying bitch!
Tell me the truth.
The girl's name was Doreen.
That's all I know.
-And you didn't know her last name?
-No.
Well, it's Carter.
That's my name!
Her father was my brother and he was murdered last Sunday.
Now get in there and get dressed.
Get in!
Where's Albert? Where's Albert?
I know where to find him.
He's come for Albert.
"I don't know.
On the ferry, I reckon."
Hello, Albert.
Hello, Jack.
I don't know anything, Jack.
Yes, you do.
Talk, or I'll kill you.
I know.
Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I know.
For Christ's sake, give us a fag.
I didn't know who Doreen was.
Though she was just another bird.
Did Eric Paice pull her?
Yes.
How?
I don't know.
Got his ways.
He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
Couple of weeks back.
How?
No choice.
I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Cliff Brumby.
He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
And you told Brumby?
Who killed Frank?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Last Sunday afternoon Eric and two of his boys arrived with Frank.
They told me he'd rumbled.
Somehow he'd seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off.
They asked me for some whisky and started forcing it down his throat.
I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do, Albert?
Nothing.
What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes.
I told him.
What did he say?
Good.
They drove Frank away in a car.
Is that all there is?
Yes.
That's it then.
Jack, for Christ's sake.
You knew what I'd do, didn't you, Albert?
Yes, but.... Christ! I didn't kill him, did I?
I know you didn't kill him.
I know!
Put me two bob on Lucky Leap, would you?
No shooters, you stupid bastards!
Cyril said no shooters!
-Do you want to get us all nicked?
-Get stuffed!
-Turn it in.
Gerald wants to see him first.
-Shut up!
Are you coming in, or are you gonna piss about all day?
You're bloody finished, you know that, Jack.
I've finished you.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
You've still got your sense of humor.
Do you want to tell him how I've finished him?
He's told Gerald about you and Anna.
He didn't believe me at first.
Then Peter talked to him.
Didn't even say goodbye.
Just asked us to take you back.
Alive.
He's probably talking to her right now.
Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face?
Stay where you are, Peter!
Don't!
Carter, your car needs a wash.
I don't want them cooking in here.
You can put a hatch in that wall.
I can do that, but it's a question of design.
Aesthetically, you've got to use--
Who in Christ's name's that?
A bloody madman!
Extraordinary fellow.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
It was the only way I could get at them.
You shouldn't have.
Your brother was going to the police.
-You didn't have the guts to do it yourself.
-They'd have killed me.
They killed my brother instead.
I didn't think they'd do it.
How would you have liked it if that had been your daughter being poked in that film?
What would you have done then?
Slags like your Sandra can get away with it. Can't they?
The Doreens of this world can't.
Can they?
It's very rude to disappear like that.
Where can he possibly be?
I have an awful feeling we're not going to get our fees on this job.
The guy on the Swing Bridge.
Okay.
-How did it happen?
-I don't know how it happened.
How far did he fall?
What did Betty say?
90 floors, I think it was.
Really, was he dead?
Yes.
Apparently he hit his head on the pavement.
-Well, he would be, wouldn't he?
It's better to go quick like that.
"Number 9, "Doctor's Orders. ""
"Five and eight, 58."
"One and five, 15."
"Two and six, 26."
"Three 0, "Blind 30. ""
"Seven and eight, 78."
"Five and three, 53."
"Nine 0, "Blind 90. ""
"Two and five..." "...on 25."
"One so far on 25."
"Anybody else please, for that full house."
"Just the one, nobody else?"
"Checking just one this time."
I've come for you, Margaret.
Who?
Fletcher!
Hold on.
Hello?
Gerald?
It's Carter.
Now listen carefully, you hairy-faced git!
I've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time.
All it takes is one call to the police.
Really?
So?
I'll do a simple deal with you.
All I want....
I see.
I think that can be arranged.
But I don't want him there until 6:00 in the morning.
Okay?
Right.
Out!
You wanted something, Cyril?
Yes, Eric.
A word with you.
Get out!
Come on. Come on!
Take your clothes off!
Keep your pants on.
Lie down.
Lie down!
I want you to listen very carefully.
Jack Carter....
Yes.
Do you know what he looks like?
Police.
You couldn't win an egg-and-spoon race, Eric.
Sod off.
Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart.
Stand up. Stand up!
I bet you could use a drink couldn't you, Eric?
Have a drink.
Still got your sense of humor.
Drink up.
Drink up.
I want you to drink all of it.
Do you understand?
Drink it all.
Just like it was with my brother Frank....
What?
Drink up!
It was you....
It was you who poured it down him, wasn't it?
Did you all have a good laugh while he was spewing up?
Drink up!
Drink!
Did you pass the bottle round when the car went over the top, eh?
Goodbye, Eric!
'Señor'
'Señor'
'Señor'
- Tighten up that girth.
- Señor I must go to San Felipe.
My mother is dead!
Straight down the road about 50 miles.
Yeah get outta here.
Hey amigo
Come here.
Perfect.
You're perfect!
I swear to God boys he's just right.
I'm gonna put you on that stage and watch those faces when they see you come in!
v ovo
- By God I...
- Never mind dear.
Over there.
Not that door the other one there.
Pull.
Pull.
There you are.
You see?
He does understand.
Who knows perhaps he can even talk.
Now now even the peasants...
A bit of mustard?
Thank you.
Even the peasants are entitled to their rights.
After all they have won a revolution.
Or at least almost.
Animals that's what they are.
Animals.
Even animals can be tame and harmless.
Personally I consider them unfortunate brutes.
Yes brutes.
Quite right.
Precisely my dear lady precisely.
I hate saying it but you should hear them in the confessional. - You would never imagine.
Did you know...?
- I can imagine Father. I can imagine.
Living in such promiscuity all of them in one room male and female together lying in a heap like rats in a sewer.
At night when the lights are out all their inibitions disappear.
You never know who is next: Mother sister daughter... goat.
Every country has its own plague.
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Just like animals. That's what they are.
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.
Hey you.
Do you know who your father was?
Do you know how old you are?
He doesn't know.
Do you know how many kids you have?
Do you know how many kids your mother had?
He doesn't know anything. It was to benefit scum like this that the Agrarian Reform was imposed.
And that ass Madero wanted to give the government and our land to idiots like this.
We are all pawns in the hands of Almighty God.
Fortunately Divine Providence has disposed of that rash individual Madero.
My dear Monsignor let us be realistic.
What you call Providence I call General Huerta.
He put the peasants in their place.
Which is the best place for animals because that's what they are.
Animals.
I can imagine.
- I can imagine living in such promiscuity......
wanted to give the government and our land to idiots like this!
- Goats.
- Animals.
- Rats! - Just like them niggers we got back home. - Half-wits!
- Animals!
Divine Providence has disposed...
Just like them niggers.
Animals. Because that's what they are.
Animals.
...like them niggers. - Brutes!
That's what they are animals.
- Like them niggers. - Brutes!
Animals!
- I consider them unfortunate brutes.
- I can imagine...
Niggers.
- Brutes! - Niggers!
...like them niggers.
- Idiots! - Niggers!
- Idiots! ...like them niggers.
- Idiots! Half-wits!
Hey you give us a hand and push.
Think they'd get off their asses to help us the bastards?
Take him away before he dirties everything.
Now ladies and gentlemen you will give everything to my niños without any trouble.
We kill them all OK Papá?
I've told you Chulo no shooting unless Papá pulls the trigger.
Come.
Come come come come!
You wanted to know my family?
That's my sons.
Each one of them from a different mother.
And now you kneel.
Kneel!
Kneel!
'Papá'
This is my father.
I think. - Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.
My mother had the blood of the Aztecs which was before your people.
And now I ask you a question.
Can you make a baby?
Can you make a baby?
That's sad.
But we will fix that.
'Señora'
Let me go! Let go.
Pretty good huh?
Oh Jesus help me I'm going to faint.
You faint now and you miss the best part.
Juanito you get everything?
You'll pay for this you bastard!
- I'm a citizen of the United States of America!
- You're an American son of a bitch.
Understand Yankee?
Thank you.
Thank you.
For everything.
Have you a light?
There is a hole in the roof.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why?
You pull that trigger and shoot me I fall.
And if I fall they'll have to alter all the maps.
You see when I go half this bloody country goes with me.
Including yourself.
- You understand now?
- Ah sí sí sí sí sí sí I understand.
It's like a miracle of God.
You you are a great magician.
I stop your motorcycle you do the magic with my coach.
- Even?
- Sí
To fix my motorcycle would be even.
I'll be inside.
We kill him now Papá? No.
First we fix the motorcycle.
- It's whisky.
- Thank God for that huh?
Where are you going in this contraption?
Well...
Where are you going?
- Shaver Mines.
Lucanina huh?
I know that place.
I know the man who owns it that fat German son of a bitch!
That crazy tub of lard Mr Aschenbach who wrings our people dry like slaves even his personal servants.
One girl had an ass: Her cheek s were hard like drums.
I got her pregnant and he...
Oh Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up and go and fix my motorcycle?
Anything you say Firecracker.
Take your hands off that.
Well good for you Firecracker.
I don't know why I named you Napoleon when you have no imagination.
This is a bank!
- Mesa Verde
- Sí Papá Mesa Verde.
Mesa Verde.
If we can get this Firecracker to come with us we will be rich.
Where does he come in?
The dynamite's right here. No no.
You need an expert for that.
You only need matches and balls.
And I got those.
- ¿Sí?
See that tree over there?
Short fuse.
Now you understand why we need the firecracker?
- Where the hell are we?
- What kind of work you do for the German?
Listen I asked you a question.
What do you do for the German?
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?
You know something?
I don't understand you.
Why do you waste your time and your holy water looking for silver?
- Have you any better ideas?
- Sí Gold is better than silver.
There isn't any gold in these hills.
Yes there is.
In Mesa Verde.
Whoever heard of having a bank in the country!
A bank?
Not a bank. The bank.
The most beautiful wonderful fantastic gorgeous magnificent bank in the world.
When you stand before the bank and you see it has the gates of gold like it was the gates of heaven.
And when you go inside everything everything is gold.
Gold spittoons gold handles. And money.
I know 'cause I saw when I was eight years old.
I went there with my father. He tried to rob the bank. They caught him but they won't catch me. ¿Eh Papá?
Right.
Listen Firecracker you listen to me.
Listen why don't you come with me and we will work together?
And we will become rich.
What the hell is your name?
John.
What?
John.
- What is your name?
- John.
That's fantastic.
That is incredible.
My name is Juan and yours is John.
Juan and John.
So what?
Can't you understand that is that is the...
Oh... Destiny.
And I mean it.
Why?
You want more money? I'll give you more than half.
I don't care about the money.
As long as we can work together.
Listen what I'm telling you.
We are like two brothers.
You make the holes with the holy water and then I walk in and do the dirty work.
Listen it takes one bandito to know another.
- So you can read? - You don't have to read.
I see a man's picture I see a price I know that man is in trouble.
Hey what kind of trouble are you in?
- Oh we fought a revolution in Ireland.
- A revolution?
Seems revolutions are all over the world like the crops.
We had a revolution. The brave people went in.
What it did to them was terrible.
Pancho Villa the world's best bandit chief two balls like a bull he went in the revolution as a great bandit came out as what?
Nothing.
A general.
That to me is the bullshit.
Wait a minute.
You come here to join the revolution?
One was enough for me.
You dirty son of a bitch!
Gringo... bastard!
Duck, you sucker!
- Say which way is it to Lucanina?
- Fuck you!
Go find it yourself!
Mexico is big but for you it is going to be very big!
John where are you? It's us!
Come on come on you.
Come on in there.
Just a little further inside.
That's right heathen bastards.
What's this?
You crazy?
Oh my friend didn't I tell you Mexico was big?
Oh shit.
Who are those people inside?
You mean who were those people inside?
Who were those people inside?
Chulo!
Who were those people for Christ's sake?
Well one of them was Aschenbach then there was three soldiers and one captain.
Everybody dead in there.
Will you keep quiet and go get our friend's equipment together?
Anyway when I went to Aschenbach and I told him
I said you wanted to see him he wouldn't believe that. I said "That's too bad because he's discovered silver. "
Then he was ready to come running.
The other one the captain...
I think the captain and Aschenbach were working together.
The captain says "I want to see the man. "
I said "How can you see him?
He's blown off his hand with dynamite he is bleeding to death. "
When they heard that they broke their asses to get here.
Anyway it's no problem because there are diamonds here no questions.
Also you have no contract so...
you are free.
There will be one little problem with the army.
They will have a hot ass when it comes to the death of a captain.
But don't worry.
I am your friend Juan and I will help.
I will do anything say anything...
No no no.
I don't need any help from you to know I've been screwed.
You fuckin' chicken thief.
What do you want with me?
Nothing.
I just thought that maybe we could go to Mesa Verde.
Isn't there anything else you remember about Mesa Verde?
Yes there's a place where you can sit down and eat.
- When you look in front you... - See the bank. That's right.
How do you know?
Listen Mesa Verde that's only the beginning.
Let me tell you it will be Juan and John the two especialistas in bank s eh?
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny.
That's more American.
Amigo we go to America there are bank s all over the place.
In California Colorado Kansas City Texas and Austin.
You have to think of the big future that we have ahead of us.
I'm thinking of the big train behind us. Hey!
Out of the way!
Hey you.
I know that face.
Where have I seen you before?
Stop right where you are!
Drop that knife you bastard.
I have family.
I have a family too.
Beautiful eh?
¿Tienen algo qué pedir?
¿Y tu?
Hey God you're sure this is Mesa Verde?
Do you have your beans with chilli?
I don't want nothing from you.
- Aw come on have some beans.
- Listen you son of a bitch!
You pull that trick on me again I break your goddamn head!
Well for Christ's sake.
A train comes along and I take it.
- Been waiting in your Mesa Verde ever since.
- It's not my Mesa Verde.
- This place is covered with soldiers like flies.
Just the way we like it?
If it's a revolution... it's confusion.
What are you talking about? Revolution confusion?
Where there's confusion a man who knows what he wants stands a good chance of getting it.
- I don't understand you.
This him?
That's him.
Him who?
- Do you trust me?
- No.
- You want to get inside there?
- Sí
Well I'm going to see to it you have that chance.
Don't move goddamn it!
Hold him still.
That does it.
Relax.
It's all over.
If you'd let this infection go any longer your widow would be paying my bill.
Mallory!
You've hardly joined us here in Mesa Verde. Already you're front-page news.
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder. "
You have a real talent for making friends.
You've stirred up a hornet's nest.
I'll grant you the captain but till now nobody dared take a crack at foreign capitalists.
Not even Pancho Villa.
It seems even His Majesty's Secret Service would like to get their hands on you.
And yet you are an asset to us.
Even if sometimes you do drink a bit too much.
Who says I drink too much?
Your liver does.
What about that one him?
He's all right.
Except that when operating he cuts deeper than I do.
What the doctor means is one time we did a little work together.
And now to our work friends.
I have good news.
In two days Villa and Zapata will attack simultaneously from north and south.
We here like those in other cities must begin parallel actions of harassment.
Pereto's downfall is just a question of week s.
Whereas Miguel's is only a question of hours if he doesn't stop smoking.
Easy to say.
We'll attack in four places at the same time.
Antonio you hit the city hall and old prisons.
You will need to divide into two groups one of them under the command of José.
Jesús the railway station and the marshalling yards as planned right?
Get in position in good time in small groups so you won't attract attention.
And act like ordinary travellers or railroad employees.
You Manolo together with Juanito will attack the army barrack s with our main forces agreed?
This is their point of maximum concentration and is the key to the success of our plan.
You must create the impression of a massive attack.
And if necessary be prepared to make the final sacrifice.
The fourth and last target Ortega the post office.
When the enemy is busy on four fronts we'll move against our real objective.
Do we still agree?
- You'll need men.
- I only need one man.
One?
Him?
Him?
Him? What is with this "him"? Him who?
Who him?
To do what?
That's what I want to know!
To attack the bank.
The bank?
We will take care of the bank.
That's why we're here so don't worry about that.
Well then what can I say?
Except...
I hope you make it.
Me too.
And him.
Well we'll meet again tonight to discuss details.
I have to go now.
I left a woman in labour and she can't wait till the revolution is over.
Leave one at a time and keep out of sight.
Speaking of sight how's your cataract?
You don't have to say anything.
I understand everything.
'Tierra y libertad'
Y libertad
Bravo Chulo.
Take it take it.
There must be a lot of money in the bank look at all those soldiers.
- You know how this work s?
- Sí It's a short fuse.
Normal rate.
30 seconds.
Sí 30 seconds.
- What did you find?
- Nothing but scrap paper.
Hey it's pointing down there.
There is the safe!
Duck, you suckers
- Where are you going for Christ's sake?
- I don't know but something's wrong.
I went into the bank. There's no money there nothing.
The bank and the money were transferred to Mexico City a month ago.
They've been using this place for a political prison ever since.
- What? A political prison?
- I never said a thing about money.
All I asked was if you wanted to get inside.
But this bank is my life this is my dream.
The reality is you've just liberated 150 patriots through sheer courage in the face of danger.
Ah yes you're a grand hero of the revolution now.
- I don't want to be a hero.
I want the money!
The money!
- You taught me one thing.
- What?
How to get fucked!
- What's that?
- It's a map.
It's your country you're lying all over.
Not my country.
My country is me and my family.
Well your country's also Huerta and the Governor and landlords.
And Gunther Ruiz and his locusts. - This little revolution we're having here. - Revolution?
Please don't try to tell me about revolution!
I know how revolutions start.
People that read book s go to people that don't read book s and say
- "The time has come for change. " - Shh! Shh!
Shit shush!
I know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about revolutions!
The people who read book s go to the people who can't read and say "We need change"
so the poor people make the change.
The people who read the book s sit around big polished tables and talk and talk and eat.
But what has happened to the poor people?
They are dead!
That's your revolution.
So please don't tell me about revolutions.
Then what happens? The same fucking thing starts all over again!
I don't like it either.
Only Gunther Ruiz is less than 20 miles from here on the road that leads to that bridge.
They will comb the area bush by bush.
So the order is to pull back hide in the San Ysidro caves.
Oh that's a brilliant order.
Here we are facing it.
You and the rest of you dreamers want to piss it up against the wall!
Not everybody can fight.
There are those who must organise co-ordinate.
Yes yes of course.
Yeah well don't pay any attention to me.
It's personal.
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.
I don't give a fuck about your revolutions.
I'm tired of running up and down these mountains and getting nowhere so I've stopped.
Right here at the bridge of San Jorge.
Maybe it's out of spite for you and your slow dream or maybe... Ah maybe my feet are sore.
'Hombres' Me and irlandés are gonna catch ourselves a couple of fucking locusts.
'Atente' You go back and hide in the grotto.
If things go bad here every man for himself. You move your asses!
¿Comprenden?
If something happens and your father doesn't come back then I pray that the great God in heaven takes care of you.
Thank you.
Listen when they are out of sight we will make a run for it. ¿SÍ?
You can't mean to stay here?
All those explosions must have gone to your head!
Remember John and Juan?
America.
The millions.
No.
I don't understand!
Wasn't that was a trick for us to get out?
- What can we do against those locusts?
- You'd be doing me a favour if you'd leave.
If I had a choice between a chicken thief and ridding the world of a few uniforms
I'd not choose the chicken thief.
No!
Oh no no. You will like that huh?
Well you listen to me you Irish piece of shit!
You think you're the only man with the balls to stay? You are wrong!
I have the balls and I stay.
He says there's no danger just watch the bridge from a long way.
No matter how I look with them I'm still too close to the bridge.
Why am I mixed up in this revolution anyway?
God why didn't you strike me down instead of letting me say "I stay too"?
Oh look at him!
All because of him.
He acts like a tourist only he's staying.
Look at him.
What the hell does he care?
He is having fun.
I'm glad he's having fun God because I am not having fun.
What's this?
Now he goes to sleep huh?
Go ahead you sleep sleep.
I tell you something when he's asleep I'll go.
Stop over there Sergeant.
God only an idiot could sleep at a time like this!
Abandon the truck s! Break rank s and take cover under the bridge!
Artillery fire.
The bridge!
All of them.
Six.
I've never counted them before.
No Juan no.
No for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.
Duck you suckers!
But for the rich you sing.
Oh Jesus Juan.
Anyway if they ever get this thing under way you might be able to might be make the border by what some time tonight don't you think?
America.
It's America Juan!
Oh Jesus if it's as great as they say it is filled bags stuffed full of dreams...
Jesus Juan.
What is it Juan and...
Johnny and Johnny?
I make the holes and you get in.
What's happening?
Oh they're just moving the train around.
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.
The uniforms have loaded the last of their shit.
Get out of the way.
What do you want from me you scum?
Let me by.
It's yours.
There's a fortune inside.
...pearls.
Well this will not be going to America.
Maybe the train won't but we will.
Which way is America?
Well it's sure as hell not that way.
That's the way.
Well then let's go.
Even Pancho Villa's heard much about you.
He's always saying "I want to meet this Miranda. "
Me?
That's right.
The military junta commander told us everything that you've done.
Whatever you heard I assure you they were only words.
Words cannot describe what Juan has done and suffered for the cause.
Hey doctor.
How you been eh?
This is a man who should talk to Villa.
John.
We thought we'd lost you doctor.
Have you got a light?
Listen Gunther Ruiz is after us and Villa wants to talk to me.
We should get outta here.
Jesus Juan you can't leave now.
You're a glorious hero of the revolution.
Can I tell you something?
Fuck you!
That's all.
A military train carrying over 1000 soldiers and heavy weapons is heading straight towards us.
What about Villa's troops?
He met resistance in the Sierra and ask s us to hold out for 24 hours.
- Where the hell are we?
- Approximately here.
Ah it's a beautiful desert there.
Not a stream or a canyon in 100 miles.
- How long you think it'll take them to get here?
- Three hours more or less.
Three hours.
Well it look s as though we'll have to stop 'em right here doesn't it?
All that takes is unbolting a couple of yards of track.
But then what?
They'd still slaughter us. Wait.
There's more than one way to stop a train.
- How much dynamite have we?
- Maybe 200 Ibs.
Is that enough for you?
Oh yes.
It'll have to do all right.
- But I also need a locomotive and a man.
- Sí sí sí OK.
- Someone who's brave and loyal to the cause.
- Never mind that.
What do I have to do?
Someone like Dr Villega.
Well...
- I... I'm honoured.
- I don't doubt it doctor.
Also because an old friend of ours is in command of that train.
A Colonel Gunther Ruiz.
Let's get shovelling man.
We'll never get up enough pressure that way.
Come on put your back in it Villega.
Let's stop pretending right away.
You know everything don't you?
- You sensed it or guessed it.
- Simpler than that Villega.
I saw you that night in the rain.
I see.
You've already judged and condemned me.
That's why you brought me with you.
It's easy to judge.
Have you ever been tortured?
Are you sure you wouldn't talk?
I was sure.
And yet I talked.
Some men died because of me.
What should I do?
Kill myself? Why?
The dead remain dead but I have not changed.
I still believe in the same things.
I can still serve the cause.
Shut up Villega!
Shut up for Christ's sake.
When I started using dynamite I believed in many things.
All of it!
Finally I believe only in dynamite.
I don't judge you Villega.
I did that only once in my life.
Get shovelling!
And I can't help you now.
Just close your eyes and jump.
Man remember huh?
You remember what you told me huh?
You told me about America.
And the bank s and the gold.
Like you told me on the train remember?
Hey.
No you son of a bitch.
Come on you son of a bitch. You know you told me that.
You leave me now what the fuck is gonna happen to me?
- You'll make it General.
- Oh shit I don't want to be a general.
Come on talk to me.
Keep talking. Talk.
Tell me about Villega Villega.
Remember Villega?
He died.
He died a great grand glorious hero of the revolution.
OK.
Easy easy.
I'll go I'll get help huh?
General?
- Have you a light? - Sí
Oh my friend I'd hate to give you a royal screwing.
I go get help.
What about me?
-Come here. -I'M BUSY!
But I found something.
I'm doing something!
You have to see it.
It's a car.
It's a tree.
Come on up.
Come on, we can do it up here.
Come on up!
Oh look, you cut your foot.
Never mind my foot.
Look at this.
A bunch of cars.
That's what this is.
What do you see outside?
Trees.
And what did you see in the picture?
Cars.
And..... What are we in?
A car in a tree.
No!
A car becoming a tree.
Listen...
You ever been looking down on a leaf and all of a sudden a butterfly came flying out of it?
Well, maybe it's the same way with cars.
Maybe cars become trees the same way leaves become butterflies.
Maybe once this place was... one of the largest used car lots in Blackfoot County.
Are your eyes closed?
No.
Well, mine are.
I'm going far away.
My eyes are closed but I'm still here.
Don't you wonder about things? There were people who lived here a long time ago.
They must have been very different from us.
They must have been an amazing people.
You think they made this, or... maybe it was just a flower that got hard?
The things with writing on them were made by men.
The things without writing just are.
Made in USA.
Maybe that's where they all went.
Why won't you go away with me?
There's no place to go!
There's the city.
There is not.
There's so many interesting things everywhere we go and nobody ever asks any questions.
We never stay anywhere long enough to find anything out.
And I'll be sitting at a river like this and I'll think... How many people have seen this river before?
Probably a lot.
And I don't know anything about those people.
Maybe someone was sitting in this same place a long time ago asking himself the same questions.
You know what I mean?
RANDA!
Randa!
What is this?
Randa!
Up!
Who's got the sled?
No good.
No good.
No good.
I told you the ones with the shell on them are no good.
This one's good.
This one's good.
This one's good.
Ohhh.. A bear went over the mountain, a bear went over the mountain, a bear went over the mountain, to see what he could find.
The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain. The bear went over the mountain, to see what he could find.
How are ya?
You know,
I saw your smoke and I couldn't help thinking there's a bunch of people probably dying for some kicks.
Well, that's what I'm here for friends.
Fun and games!
Now, I'm not here to steal your food or feel your women.
I'm not here to grab your stuff or treat you rough.
I'm here to play.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a show.
A proper stage entertainment, to tickle up your liver, laugh your belly into jelly and turn you every way but loose.
And that's the truth. Look out!
Here comes that crazy fool again, he's going make me laugh, bust my gut.
No, sir.
What a treat.
You're gonna laugh, you're gonna cry.
You're gonna kiss your brains goodbye.
Yes, sir.
I am going to give you not only these free Woolworth balloons... Not only these genuine tootsie rolls but I am prepared to sock real money to each and every one of you, ah, distinguished ladies and gentlemen.
Here's a nickel for you, ma'am.
Here's, ah, a dime for you, young lady.
You want a nickel, kid?
Oh, there's a quarter's worth behind you.
Here you are, honey.
Now, that's just a show of my good faith.
Friends... tell you what.
I'm going to set up my humble camp right over there.
But come nightfall, as soon as it gets dark... then there's going to be joy and roof-raising among us!
Because tonight's the night of the big show!
And, uh, listen... While you're just sitting around the house goosing each other you, uh, might want to look through your knapsacks and, uh... your pockets and see what you can find... in the way of gold money, jewelry and the like.
You all just bring it right to me and we'll do business together.
Yes, sir.
Spit and swap horses, get that old economy moving again.
Oh, look.
Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about.
Well, what I want you to do is to bring me anything that shines or glistens.
Because I'll tell you, that real gold, real silver, real jewelry sure makes me smile.
Then we could smile together, couldn't we?
Yes, we could.
Alright, that's it.
Tonight after dark... the big show!
Gas.
Gas?
For the engine.
For the engine?
Gas for the engine.
To make the car go.
Make the wheels turn around.
Get from place to place.
Hey, you look pretty strong.
I bet you could do this.
You want to give it a try?
That's good.
You just grab right there.
That's it.
Just keep pulling it out and letting it back in again.
That's good.
Cars can go.
Yeah, cars can go.
And fish can swim. Birds can fly.
Areas can expand and, uh, projects can originate.
Now, look kid.
If you're gonna go, you gotta have fuel.
You know, brother goes to school, sister goes to dance class. Daddy goes to work. And, uh....
Yeah, but you wouldn't want to eat the gasoline.
Look, uh... Don't ever let me catch you doing this. Smoking around a gas pump.
You know anything about these? You know how to play 'em?
Huh? ..... I just got it.
-No. -I'd sure like someone to show me how.
It's a Hohner Marine Band.
Well, look.... As soon as you finish up there....... Fill up the other can.
Put it all together, and bring it all over to my rig there.
I got something to show you. Alright?
Keep pumpin'.
I see now?
Let there be light!
I now see... the tower of the big top.
I don't care if you're fat or thin.
I don't care if you're tall or short.
I don't care if you're hip or square, if you're nearsighted or farsighted, if you're straight, gay, or Republican!
Come on in.
Statistics tell us...
I'm telling you statistics tell us that everybody has got something they need.
Everybody is somebody's fool!
Can you dig it?
Ladies and gentlemen...
I want to tell you that it is no longer necessary to live without the necessities of life.
Everything is there.
The cornucopia is wide open.
You've got to remember that the business of business, is business.
All you have to do is reach out your hand.
Just get on the pipe...
Hello, Sol. Buy Xerox!
Now, I'm telling you it's all there waiting for you.
Everything is important, anything is possible.
Get the leads.
You just have to touch things and they go.
The world is made for us!
For you and me.
So, what's the point of eating raw bread?
Now, I'm going to show you...put it right in there...
I'm going to show you the miracle of modern science in operation!
Just watch it go.
Watch it go.
Anything is possible.
The fruits of the earth with Man's ingenuity become all things, for all men.
Now, the miracle.
Cereal!
I'm telling you, folks.
Anything is possible. So long as you keep your eye on the future.
Don't try to look back to the past.
I think it's time I got to know you people and you got to know me.
So, I'm going to take a little trip into the audience here.
Here's a little lady right here.
What's your name, honey?
Well, what's my name?
That's all right, honey.
We got a prize for you anyway.
This official plastic pig. All you have to do..
is wind it up and it'll go anywhere.
Take you anywhere, too.
There's a fine looking little creature there.
How are you, honey?
Say, tell us, uh....
Tell us what that feels like.
Come on, what does it feel like to you?
Come on. Aw, come on.
Can't win 'em all.
Well...
I can feel it starting to happen.
I can feel it coming up now.
There's a climax coming.
Can you feel it?
Can you taste it?
Can you smell it?
Can you see it?
It's coming.
The circle grows tighter.
Yes, sir. It is the biggest event in theatrical history.
The biggest thing since Jackie fired the maid.
Show business heaven!
Get the bubbles.
I recollect that it was in El Paso that Broadway Joe pulled the plug and fired the cannon.
Can you read me?
The first step is coming.
One giant step for mankind.
You can feel it.
I can feel it.
We all know... it's going to happen.
The big step is here.
Okay. Hold on.
Dig in.
Blast off!
And it's a high line drive to center field.
The end of an era, it's history in the making.
Now we have done it.
Now we are at the top.
Cue the healing.
Now the thunder subsides. Every cloud's a veritable thrill and delight.
Now we are on the move.
Can you read me?
All systems are go.
If music be the food of love, then play on!
Hurry up, it's coming to an end.
Just take a match and light it.
Use the other side, you jerk.
That's it.
Just drop it there.
Drop it, damn it.
Get the sand can you idiot!
That really hurt me this time.
Goddamn it!
That's enough, stop it.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Stop it!
Thank you, thank you.
I'm honored.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
It's loveliness increases, it will never pass into nothingness but will keep a bower quiet for us.
And a sleep full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing.
That guy died when he was 25.
I guess that's, uh, the name of the game.
Is there a city?
Is there...a city?
Why, yes.
There's a city, my boy.
There's the towers of Babylon... the seven cities of Cibola.
There's canyons of steel.
Where is the city?
It's far, far away.
Over the mountains.
You don't want to go there.
Yes, I do. i do want to go there.
The bear went over the mountain, The bear went over the mountain, The bear went over the mountain,
To see what he could find. What is this city really like?
The other side of the mountain, He saw another mountain. He saw another mountain,
That's all that he could find.
Why don't you come inside? To my pleasure palace.
Come on, you haven't seen it yet.
Warmer.
Nice in here.
This is Xanadu.
Here, let me take that stuff from you honey.
Just put it over here.
Okay, you sit right there son.
You sit over here. Here honey, you sit over here.
Look at that.
Satin sheets.
Bet you never saw that before.
You sit down there and wiggle around and see what it feels like.
You tell me what it feels like there.
Well, let's see.
And we got ketchup.
Well, the Indonesians cook with, uh.. peanut butter. I guess we'll have an Indonesian dish, huh?
Nasi goreng.
Alright, nasi goreng.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Tell me about the city.
Tell you about the city, huh?
I want to go there.
Well, I'll tell you.
It's a sinful and decadent place.
I was born and raised there.
I was 15 when the whole thing was totaled.
Now, I guess you could drop me on my street in the middle of the night bare assed and I'd know right where I was.
They was dropping dead in the streets for years.
Waters rising and...
Oh, there's Merv Griffin,
Dean Martin on the tube.
They said it all.
Down in New York City,
I got nothing to do.
Sorry that I can't take you.
Combinations. Rock and roll.
And, uh, the Pelham Parkway. Holland Tunnel.
Rain on the Taft Hotel.
Mick Jagger.
I'll tell you this kid. It all comes to show business in the end.
And that's the truth.
Here you are, honey.
This is for you.
I'll dig out some more stuff later.
Here you are. This is for you.
And this is for me.
It's a tasty morsel.
Something to, ah, wrap your tongue around.
Yeah. Food for the soul.
Ladies and gentlemen, there exists before me in ripe plumpness and innocence ...an old man's satisfaction.
What do you say, kid?
Just lay it on me?
Thank you, sweet one.
What?
Are there people there?
Where?
In the city.
People in the city... Oh... I don't think so.
There might be people there but you don't want to go there, kid.
Yes, I do.
Oh, take a raincheck on it.
Let's look at some snaps.
If you're asking me what it's like....
Look at this.
This'd be my father.
And the biggest fallout shelter in the Bronx.
He was on the road when it came down.
Why don't I, uh, sit down here.
He was on the road when it came down.
This is the summer house we had in Pekahoe.
See?
That's my sister.
She's a knockout, huh?
Pretty?
Looks a little bit like you.
This is me and little Eddie.
Cute, huh?
Would you tell me how to get to the city?
You're some kind of fanatic, aren't ya?
Tell you what.
Why don't you... go out on the back of the motorcycle.
And on the locker, you know, those big tall lockers.
On the left... You open it up and there's a whole pile of stuff in there.
And you see right on top of it, there's a map.
You know what a map is.
No.
Well, it's a big piece of paper all folded up like an accordian.
If you open it up you see all these red lines and different colored names of places.
Right on the front, when it's folded up, it says Idaho.
Okay?
You just get that. Okay?
You're a friendly little thing, aren't you?
Yeah, nice friendly little thing.
I'll tell you what.
Let's just... commemorate this for posterity.
I hope you're not offended.
Now look, uh....
I'm kind of an old man here.
I don't know...
I don't want to do anything wrong.
Anything to offend you, you understand.
So, uh... If I do anything to offend you...
You just let me know. Okay?
Okay?
Because, uh...
My pleasure.... is your pleasure, understand?
I'm still, uh....pretty well muscled.
Oh, I know it's kind of funny, I suppose.
You like that, don't you?
You're really like an angel.
You're just as smooth as heaven.
Take me to the city!
Lift your leg.
Where's the noise?
Oh, god.
Help me, now.
You want to lift up there.
You want to lift yourself up.
Ah, yeah.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, that's good.
You make me feel like a teenager.
That feel good?
Is that good?
Open it, open it up.
Sorry, wait a minute. Don't twist my arm.
Now just a minute, goddamn it.
I'll get right to it.
There by god.
Look at that.
Isn't that something?
By God, there's a little life in the old soldier yet.
Look.
You don't know how beautiful that is.
Okay.
Now, you see where this red line is here...
That's the freeway.
Now, you see how that freeway keeps going down and keeps going south.
Well, down right there and right across the mountains ...that's the city.
Right across the mountains.
You are too good a man for slavery, Prince Valiant.
I give you a quest.
Well, you go and find the Holy Grail.
Go ahead.
Find the Holy Grail.......
Go ahead.
You don't have to go if you don't want to, honey.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm going.
You're going to the city?
You coming with me?
You don't have anything to eat.
I got the cans from the magician.
- We don't have any fire.
- I got Diamond matches from the magician.
- Yeah, but you don't know how to get there.
- I got the map.
Wake up, you fanatic.
The fire's going out.
Hey, I got some plates!
Why don't we go someplace better?
I'm reading this book I found in the Samsonite.
It's a Wonder Woman book.
Her face changes in every square.
Maybe that's how come she can fly.
I wonder if I'll be able to change like that.
You never change.
Don't hurt us, we just want to go to the city.
He can't talk.
He only wants to eat us like the rest of the dogs.
It's not a dog.
Oh, I know...
The magician had a box of them with a picture on the front.
Little things inside.
It's a camel.
It won't hurt us.
Ti-i-i-me is on my side.
Yes it is.
Ti-i-me is on my side.
Ti-i-i-me is on my side.
He's following us.
I think he wants to come.
He looks so tired.
Get a rope.
-There's no rope around here. -There's everything everywhere.
Glen, do you think I'm changing?
I feel terrible.
I think this is a horse, not a camel.
I'll tell you a story to make you happy.
There's a boy who's crippled who comes into the book to help Wonder Woman.
And he says a very loud "Shazam!" and there's lightning... and he becomes Captain Marvel.
And he saves Wonder Woman and everybody's happy except for the people that are still purple and blue.
Glen, I want to go back to the road.
I want to stop.
I'm stopping!
Maybe you're going to have some babies.
Well, we can put 'em in a sack and take them to the city with us.
We've got nothing to make a sack out of.
Well, why don't you have it now while they're small and I can carry them in my pocket.
I can't do that.
I don't know how to do that.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
The horse won't come!
Come on, you can make him come.
Come on!
I'm not coming either!
Come on!
Glen!
Glen!
Let me try.
Let me try. Gimme.
Wait!
Glen!
-Give me the box. -What..wait.
Glen...
Hey, I only got a couple left.
You always say there's everything everywhere.
Glen?
Do we have enough matches to get to the city?
Glen?
What are we going to eat when the cans run out?
What are we going to eat when the cans run out?
Glen?
Glen?
I want to stay here.
It's beautiful here.
Everything's so green.
There's plenty of water here.
We can find good things to eat in the woods.
Shazam!
Shazam!
Shazam!
Batman and Aquaman and Trackman and Flagman
and...
Playboy and canyons of steel and glittering lights...and
Doris Day and Polaroid...and Palisades Park
and Safeway and Rock and Roll and Prince Valiant
and....the Holland Tunnel and Playboy and Miss January and Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones and ice machines and Broadway....and....
Can we have a fire?
There's no wood.
We could burn the Wonder Woman.
It's our last match.
Can we go back?
We wouldn't make it.
You better eat some.
Swallow it.
Swallow it!
You know.... I haven't seen anyone in 20 years.
Milk.
I'm going to take you to a house.
A house?
You can stay there and have the baby.
You are going to have a baby, aren't you?
It's only twenty minutes from here.
Twenty minutes?
Maybe a half hour.
I don't understand.
You don't?
I guess I'm kind of out of practice talking.
I mean, it's like I said, I haven't talked to anyone in a long time.
No, I mean what's twenty minutes?
-Do you want to?
-What?
Do you want to?
Want to what?
You know... Like I said, go to the house.
Okay.
How do you feel?
Should we?
Oh, you mean now.
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
You said we were going to a house?
Yes.
What's your name?
Sidney Miller.
I'm Glen and she's Randa.
Is this the end of the world?
Couldn't see very far from here because of the mountains.
Beautiful mountains.
And the freeway started right over there.
It went right up right up through the mountains.
Beautiful driving in the mountains.
My Aunt had a farm over there.
Wasn't very big, but..... you'd grow a lot of....
Look at those birds.
Seagulls.
Seagulls.
I don't eat birds.
I don't like fishing either, but I guess I better fish rather than go out in the mountains.
Well.... uh...
I'll tell you
Howie Hawkes owned all that land in there.
I'll tell you something about Howie Hawkes. He grew the best potatoes in Idaho.
I don't like to say that, but he did.
Sidney Miller, you live here?
No, this is Arleen's house.
You and your wife can sleep here on the sofa.
No, wait! Wait!
Did you people just come up from the city?
No, we're looking for the city.
But it's... back down...a few miles down the road.
But I heard it all burned down.
You must have passed it.
Is this house going to burn down too?
Oh, no. This is a new trailer.
No, that's not our city.
What's the name of your city?
Well, it's been a long.......
That's it.
That's the name of the city.
That's not the name of our city.
Our city's Metropolis.
Has lots of cars and all the clothes are white.
And...all the people can fly.
Metropolis must be a nice city.
I never went there.
Have you ever seen a baby before?
Oh, sure.
Goats have babies all the time.
Why don't you get out if you're not going to help me.
Acting like you're sick all the time.
Nothing lasts. about..not..
-Sidney Miller?
-Yes?
What's this?
-That's a TV.
-What is it for?
Oh, they used to watch it all the time.
He walks around there and looks at things and touches things.
That's all he ever does.
Oh, don't worry about it.
He'll die sooner or later.
having..the.. clothes.. and things...
Actually..they..
live.. like..animals.
But..you..start..to feel..sorry..for them..
and...start..to..make..a....a... people... out..of..them.
It's nothing to see them walking down the road... and if...they..have..to..go..to..the..bath..room..
They..just..stop and go..right..where ..they..are,...men..and...women...alike.
It's..enough..to..make..you..sick..to..your..stomach.
We're not animals, we're people!
We have to start living like people and be civilized!
Civilized...
Sit down and watch.
Oh, yes, dearest.
Anything that hurts you will hurt me too.
Do you love me, Randa?
Hello, Sol? Buy Xerox.
I can hear him.
He's trying to tell me something.
What's he saying?
He's saying I want to come out. I want to come out and see my father and the world and see what it's like.
No, he doesn't.
He likes it in there. It's a soft world in there.
Hello! Hello!
Hey! Yoo-hoo in there.
Come on out and say hello.
Say hello. Hello? Hello!
Let's try a new one.
But the really good ones are hard to do with your belly like that.
It's not my fault!
Leave me alone.
Why are you mad at me?
-Why don't you put the book down and just do it?
-What's wrong with the book?
-I don't want to do that anymore. -Sometimes you make me sick.
You know, one of these days I'm gonna.... ....rip open that big fat stomach.
There's four logs here that wasn't here yesterday.
These two, that brown one, and that short one.
I come down every day and check everthing out.
They send these things to me.... ...leave them on the beach....
When the tide goes down I have to check them all.
I don't like to get behind.
I try to keep up with everything.
See what's here.
Oh, look at the rocks.
I always stop here too.
It's a good place to pause.
Lots of...green.
You like green?
I'd, uh.... like to know if I'm supposed to do anything but I guess if I was supposed to know, I'd just know.
Wait.
Right here's where I usually stop and... listen.
Hear that?
You said there were mountains over there.
Well, used to be.
But there's not anymore.
Is there a city on the other side?
No, no city.
Oh! Maybe there is.
I hadn't thought of that.
Maybe that's where they're sending the things from.
I'd wanted to ask you...
Are there any more.... Are there any more coming?
-What do you mean? -You know...
More people like you and Randa.
Oh, well I'm sorry.... I don't....
Just....just forget it.
That's all right.
This is the sort of thing they send me.
Now I don't know if that's alive or dead.
But the flies know.
I guess the flies know alright.
Oh, no, no. Put it down.
Oh, I guess that's alright. It doesn't....
It doesn't really matter.
Along....about here is where I make my turn.
Take a few minutes here.
You got the whole expanse.
Usually a few birds come over.
But it doesn't really matter if there's no birds.
You've got the sunset.
It's quiet.
From here you can see the trailer. The goats.
And it's a fine feeling.
Fine feeling.
Do I look like Arleen?
I am Wonder Woman.
It's alright to let them burn.
We need heat.
We should have stayed in the cave by the river.
Oh, it hurts!
No, it doesn't.
Oh, stop! It hurts!
She's going to have the baby.
Randa?
We should go someplace.
No.
No, I can't.
I never been anywhere.
What's the baby's name?
You can call him anything you want to.
I can?
We should go someplace.
We got to fix the boat.
It's leaking.
Maybe we could find the city.
City burned down.
Metropolis didn't burn down.
It's at the end of the ocean.
I suppose it is.
When we get to Metropolis, we could find the name for the baby.

It's poisonous. Every part of it is poison.
Die !
Didn't you say his mother was a widow, Marcus ?
I think so.
I don't really know very much about him.
He seems to be a nice lad.
I do have an impression that he lives in rather a small house with his mother.
He seems a very nice boy.
Now, is everyone here ?
Ah, Leo. Good evening.
Good evening, Mrs. Maudsley.
Mr. Maudsley.
Now, let us go in to dinner.
You were in cranking form today at croquet, Marian.
Was I ?
Come along, Marian.
Marian is quite formidable at croquet.
Am I ?
I believe we must be weary of you, Leo.
I understand you're a magician.
Is that true ?
Well, not for real. Only, you know... At school.
Anyway, it was supposed to be a secret, actually.
His curses are fearful.
He cast a fiendish spell on two boys at school.
They fell of the roof. And were severely mutilated.
Did they die ? Oh, no.
They were just a little, you know... severely mutilated.
Was it difficult to arrange ? I mean, to get them to fall off the roof without killing them.
Well, it wasn't a killing curse, you see.
There are curses and curses.
It depends on the curse.
How frightening.
You're not going to bewitch us here, are you ?
Oh, no.
I shouldn't think so.
Hello. Have you been enjoying yourself ?
Pretty warm.
What does it say ?
83. Warm.
The suit is a little warm, isn't it ?
No, sir.
Enjoying yourself ?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Good.
There's another thing.
When you undress you mustn't fold up your clothes and put them on the chest.
You must leave them lying wherever they happen to fall.
The servants will pick them up. That's what they're for.
You are looking hot.
Haven't you anything cooler to wear ?
I'm not hot, really.
That's a Norfolk jacket, isn't it ? Yes.
Well, it's quite appropriate, then, isn't it ?
After all, we are at Norfolk.
Have we a pair of bellows, mama ?
Why ?
To cool Leo.
Does Leo need cooling ?
I may look hot, but I'm really quite cool underneath.
Did you leave your summer clothes at home ?
I expect mother forgot to put them in.
Why don't you write and ask her to send them ?
Oh, that would take too long, mama.
Let me take him in to Norridge tomorrow and get him a new outfit.
Would you like that, Leo ?
Well, I haven't any money.
At least only...
Oh, they can be your birthday presents from us.
When is your birthday ?
Well, it's on the 27th of this month, actually.
I was born under the sign of Leo.
Oh, good. I can give you a lion skin.
Or a mane.
Well, we'll go tomorrow.
Wouldn't you rather wait until Monday, when Hugh will be here ?
Norridge would hardly be a treat for Hugh, mama.
Trailing around the shops ?
Besides, by Monday Leo will have melted into butter.
And all he'll need will be a muslin bag.
May we go, mama ?
Yes, of course you may.
You flew too near the sun and you were scorched.
What did your father do ?
He worked in a bank, actually. And he was a pacifist.
And he was a book collector.
He liked books very much. And so he collected them.
That was his hobby.
Mother said they're quite valuable. We might have to sell them.
Here's your pudding.
What's it like ?
Very good.
Used any black magic on anyone lately ?
Not really, no.
I envy you in your power.
What's it like to have such power at your fingertips ?
Oh, it makes you feel fairly good.
But I only have used it at school, you know.
Can you teach me ?
I could use it here.
Would you really want to ?
No, not really.
The results might be too alarming.
Would you like to amuse yourself in the cathedral for a while ? I have some shopping to do.
Yes, certainly.
Can you amuse yourself in a cathedral ?
Well, it wasn't a killing curse, you see.
There are curses and curses.
It depends on the curse.
Most impressive.
Superb.
What a splendid green.
Remarkably elegant.
Most fetching.
Charming.
Did you get the tie at Cello and Cello ?
Of course.
And where did you get the shoes ?
Sterling and Porter.
What green is this ?
Lincoln green.
I thought so.
I shall dub you Sir Robin Hood.
Do you feel different ?
I feel quite another person.
Let me have a proper look at you.
I think he does very well. And I hope that your mother will think so too.
Have you written to her, Leo ?
Yes, I have. Good.
You've chosen very well, Marian. Did you do any shopping for yourself ?
Oh, no, mama. That can wait.
It mustn't wait too long.
You didn't see anyone in Norridge, I suppose ?
Not a soul.
We were hard at it all the time, weren't we, Leo ?
Yes, we were.
Your mother has written to me that you are liable to colds.
But you can watch the others bathe, of course.
Why are you bringing your bathing suit if you're not allowed to swim ?
It's just a bathing party.
But you're not going to swim.
I know I'm not.
In that case, why ?
What cheek !
The man's trespassing.
What should we do ?
Order him off.
What cheek !
Who can he be ?
I don't know.
He's a good swimmer.
And really rather well-built. Don't you think ?
Come on, Jane. Let's go and change.
Shall we order him off ?
It's Ted Burgess.
Who's he ?
The tenant of Blackfarm.
We can't be rude to him.
He farms the land on the other side.
Perhaps you'd better be nice to him.
I should just say how do you do.
We don't know him socially, of course. But I think I'd better be nice to him, don't you ?
I would say so.
I didn't know anyone was going to be here.
Just started on the harvest.
It got so hot.
Don't worry at all, please.
We were hot too, up at the hall.
Very hot.
I won't be long.
Just one more header.
Absolutely, absolutely.
I think I put him at his ease, don't you ?
I shouldn't put on a bathing suit if you're not going to swim.
It would look absurd.
I'll get you for that. My hair's gone down.
It's all wet.
I'll never get it dry.
Oh, you do look so dry and smug.
I should like to throw you in the river.
Is that man gone ?
Yes.
He went off in a hurry.
His name is Ted Burgess.
He's a farmer.
Do you know him ?
Oh, I may have met him.
Oh, it's dripping on my dress.
Here's my bathing suit.
It's quite dry.
If you fasten it around your neck, so that it hangs down your back then you can spread your hair on it, and your hair will get dry and your dress won't get wet.
Spread my hair on it.
Take care not to pull it.
Is it well spread ?
Is it dry ?
What a comfort. Your bathing suit on my shoulders.
Is my hair well spread ?
Oh yes, it is.
See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil.
Wherefore be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.
But be filled with the spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
Giving thanks always for all things.
Let us pray.
Keep us, we beseech Thee oh Lord, with Thy perpetual mercy.
And because the frailty of man, without Thee, cannot but fall, keep us ever, by Thy help, from all things hurtful and lead us to all things profitable to our salvation, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Now, everybody, let us decide what we are to do today.
Hugh, come sit down here.
And advise us.
Now what do you suggest ?
What's up ?
It's decent of you to trickle along, but don't come in.
I have a headache and some spots.
Mama thinks it may be measles.
Ah, Jeez !
Seen Trimingham ?
Is he the man with the face ?
Yes. Got it in the war.
He was gored by the Boers.
Ah, Jeez !
I don't think we've been introduced.
My name is Trimingham.
How do you do, Trimingham ?
You can call me Hugh, if you like.
Or Trimingham, if you prefer.
Why not Mr. Trimingham ?
I think Trimingham is slightly more in order, if you prefer it to Hugh.
But why not Mr. Trimingham ?
Well, as a matter of fact, I'm a viscount.
Viscount Trimingham ?
That's right.
Oughtn't I to call you Milord ?
No, no, Hugh will do.
Or Trimingham, if you like.
What's your name ?
Colston.
Mr. Colston ?
Leo, if you like.
I'll call you Leo, if I may.
Yes, that's quite all right.
Does Marian call you Leo ? Oh, yes.
I think she's ripping.
I'd do anything for her.
What would you do ?
Oh, anything. Anything.
Would you like to take her a message for me ?
Oh, yes.
What shall I say ?
Tell her I've got her prayer book.
She left it behind in church.
How careless. I forget everything.
Please thank him for me.
What the hell do you think you're doing ?
I could give you the biggest thrashing you've ever had in your life.
My knee.
Get up.
What are you doing here ?
Who are you anyway ?
I know you. We've met.
Met ?
At the bathing place.
You were bathing.
I came with the others.
You're from the Hall.
Can you walk ?
I saw you dive.
You did it jolly well.
You were lucky. You might have spoiled your suit.
Miss Marian gave it to me.
Miss Marian Maudsley.
Bandaging.
Is it stinging ?
Yes.
You're a Spartan.
Won't you want that ?
Oh, I've got plenty more.
Try walking.
Thank you very much, Mr. Burgess.
Is there anything I can do for you ?
Well, perhaps there is.
Could you take a message for me ?
Of course.
Who to ?
How old are you ?
I shall be 13 on the 27th of this month.
Can I trust you ?
Of course you can.
There's a boy, isn't there ?
A lad of your age.
He's in bed with measles.
Oh, is he ?
Are you ever alone with anybody in the house ?
Nobody talks to me much.
They're all grown up, you see. Except Marcus.
He's in bed.
Marian talks to me.
Miss Marian.
Ah, does she ?
She often talks to me.
She talks to me most.
When her hair was wet... Are you ever alone with her ?
I mean just the two of you in a room with no one else.
Well, sometimes. Sometimes we sit together on the sofa.
On a sofa ?
Could you give her a letter ? Without anybody else seeing.
Of course I could.
But can I trust you ?
To keep your mouth shut ?
Because, you see... It's a secret.
All right ?
I'll trust you.
There.
Is this his ?
He said he wouldn't want it back.
Shall I throw it on the rubbish dump ?
Oh, I don't know.
Perhaps I'll wash it out.
Seems a quite good handkerchief.
He asked me to give you this.
It's a bit crumpled.
This dress is.
Now, the bandage.
You've put it on.
Oh, yes.
Now I'll put on your stocking.
I can do that. No, no.
I'll put it on.
You won't tell anyone about this letter, will you ?
You wouldn't, would you ?
Of course I wouldn't.
Hello. There's Mercury.
Why do you call him Mercury ?
'Cause he takes messages.
You took your message for me, didn't you, old child ? To this young lady here on the way from church.
You didn't fetch a very warm response.
Do you know who Mercury was ?
Mercury is the smallest of the planets.
Ah, but before that he was the messenger of the gods.
He went to and fro between them.
Do you know Ted Burgess ?
Ted Burgess ? We all know Ted Burgess.
He's a bit of a lad, Ted Burgess.
What do you mean by a lad ?
I should have said he was a full grown man.
Enjoying yourself ?
Oh, yes thank you, sir.
Miss your mother ?
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.
A little, sir.
Pretty hot today.
Is it a record ?
I shouldn't be surprised.
I'll have to look it up.
Hot weather suit you ?
Yes, sir.
Mercury !
Come here.
I want you.
Trying to sneak past in dead ground.
Where were you off to ?
Nowhere.
Ah, nowhere.
Well, would you like to go somewhere ?
Yes, where ?
It's up to you.
I want you to find Marian.
We need her to make a four at croquet.
No idea where she is.
Can you find her ?
I don't know.
Well, no one else could. But you can.
Will you do that ?
Yes.
You must bring her back dead or alive.
What are you doing here ?
Hugh asked me to find you.
Why ?
He wants you to play croquet.
He said I was to bring you back dead or alive.
Well, which am I ?
I'm going to luncheon with some neighbors tomorrow.
They're very old and mossy.
I don't suppose you want to come, do you ?
Oh, no.
I can stay here.
What will you do ?
Oh, anything.
Yes, but what ?
I might go for a walk.
Where to ?
I might slide down the straw stack.
Whose ?
Farmer Burgess.
Oh, his ?
Oh well, Leo, if you go that way perhaps you'd give him a letter for me.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Why, because you like him ?
Yes.
But there's another reason.
What is it ?
Because I like you.
Tell her that's all right.
Look what you've done.
Tell her that's no go.
You may now enter boldly.
My disease has fled.
But you don't look better.
Of course I'm better.
I shall be down this afternoon.
You can bore me with your life story.
Marian, Marcus is better. He...
Ah, a conspiracy.
A love scene.
May I seize you from this fortunate fellow ?
Is "seize" an appropriate word ?
"Gather", then.
May I gather you from this fortunate fellow ?
Do you mind if I'm gathered, Leo ? Oh, no.
Not at all.
Hello.
How's the postman ?
Very well, thank you.
Brought anything for me ?
I'm afraid I shan't be able to bring you any more letters.
Why not ?
Marcus has got over his measles.
You said he wasn't to know.
If he came here with me. Then he would know.
Have you told Miss Marian this ?
No.
She won't know what to do. Nor shall I.
What did you do before I came ?
Well, it wasn't so easy then.
She likes you, doesn't she ?
You want her to like you, don't you ? You wouldn't want her to stop liking you.
No, you wouldn't.
She won't be the same to you if you don't take her letters.
That's the truth.
They're not just ordinary letters.
She'll miss them. So shall I.
She'll cry perhaps.
Do you want her to cry ?
It's not hard to make her cry.
She used to cry before you came along.
Did you make her cry ?
She cried when she couldn't see me.
How do you know ?
Because she cried when she did see me.
I've been busy.
Smiler's going to have a foal. She's ill.
Why does she have it then, if it makes her ill ?
She hadn't much choice.
What made her have one ?
What ?
What made her have one ?
Between you and me... She did a bit of spooning.
Spooning ?
I didn't know horses could spoon.
That'a a silly word, really.
What's it mean ?
You seem to know something about it.
I don't know anything about it.
That's the point.
It's all this kissing, isn't it ?
That's what it is.
I've seen it on postcards on the seaside.
You can't tell me horses do that.
Horses don't do that.
Well, what do they do ?
What does anyone do ?
There's more to it than just kissing.
I know that.
But what ?
You'll find out.
Could you marry someone ? Without ever spooning with them ?
Spooning is a silly word.
Well, whatever the word is. Could you marry someone ? And never do whatever it is ?
You could.
But it wouldn't be a very lover-like thing to do.
Lover-like ?
That's enough questions anyway.
But you haven't told me anything.
All right.
Let's make a bargain.
I tell you all about it... on the condition that you go on being our postman.
Why did you say I couldn't wear my cap ?
Because it's a school cap.
If it was an England cap, or a county cap, or club cap... then, of course, you could wear it.
But to wear a school cap in a private match simply isn't done.
Stump pump.
And this is our twelfth man, Mr. Colston.
Oh, we know each other, milord, Mr. Colston and me.
He comes to slide down my straw stack.
Of course. He's told us all about it.
Are you a good batman ?
Oh, no, not me. I'm not much of a cricketer, really.
He can be very dangerous in the open.
We've got to get him out quickly.
I'm not a cricketer.
I just hit.
Well, we're going to get you out... before you get the chance.
He's on the top.
He's batting.
Wasn't he fine ?
Such command and elegance.
We're in trouble. There's only me to come. I mean, that's only good , quite frankly.
Come on.
That's me.
It's absolutely up to me.
But he's not young. I mustn't tire him.
Run !
No !
Why does he keep saying no ?
He wants to save my father's strength.
Which is a little unnecessary, I think.
No !
Go on !
Beautifully played, sir.
Thank you very much.
Now, what are we going to do about you ?
Oh, I shan't give you much trouble.
We'd better get Burgess out whatever we do.
Trimingham is far too cunning for him.
Burgess has no sense of culture or discipline.
Mrs. Maudsley, are you all right ?
Oh, yes. Perfectly all right.
That was a close shave.
What a shock !
He's terribly savage.
Where's our twelfth man ?
Are you all right, Marian ?
Yes, mama, thank you.
The ball didn't hurt you ?
It didn't touch me, mama.
Magnificent catch !
I didn't mean to catch you out.
With a damned good catch.
I never thought I'd be caught out by our postman.
Well played, Ted.
And last but not least, except in stature our young David, who slew the Goliath of Blackfarm, if I may so describe it.
Not with a sling but with a catch.
And now I believe it is time for the music.
Who, I wonder, will be prepared to give us the first song ?
Ted's the one.
He's the beginner and he's the best shot with a gun.
Come on, Ted.
I can't see the piano player.
There is no piano player.
He's got a player-finger disease.
Come on, Ted. Don't be shy.
You don't need no music.
Come on Ted. Take your collar off first, it's gonna strangle you.
Come on, be a gentleman. You just act like one.
Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes.
What'd you say ?
Speak up !
Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes.
Take a pair of sparkling eyes
Hidden ever and anon in a merciful eclipse.
Do not heed their mild surprise
Having passed the Rubicon
Take a pair of rosy lips
Take a figure trimly planned
Such as admiration whets
Be particular in this
Take a tender little hand
Fringed with dainty fingerettes
Press it, press it in parenthesis
Ah, take all these you lucky man
Take and keep them if you can, if you can
Take all these, you lucky man
Take and keep them if you can.
If you can.
Take my counsel, happy man
Act upon it if you can, if you can, if you can.
Act upon it if you can
Happy man, if you can.
Well, Leo, what's it to be ?
I can sing Angels Ever Bright and Fair.
But it's a sacred song.
All right.
Angels ever bright and fair
Take, oh, take me to your care.
Speed to your own courts my flight
Clad in robes of virgin white
Well, thank goodness we said goodbye to the village for a year.
Did you notice the stink in that hall ?
What a whiff.
I suppose you were too busy wooing, and rolling your eyes and sucking up the applause.
Still, it takes two.
I must admit you didn't do too badly.
Oh, thank you.
Except that it was rather horrific to see your slimy serpent's tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth. And your face like a sick cow.
You poofey ! Nanny's bed wetter !
Hey, I'll tell you a secret.
What ?
Marian's engaged to marry Trimingham.
It could be announced after the ball.
Are you glad ?
Yes, I am. I'm sure I am.
Are you going out ?
Yes.
Shall we ?
I'm afraid I can't.
Why not ? Sorer ?
Nanny Robinson isn't well.
She lives in the village.
Marian says I have to spend the afternoon with her.
Isn't it boring ?
Marian said she was going herself after tea.
What will you do ?
Where will you drag your evil-smelling carcass ?
Oh, I might hang around the rubbish heap for a bit.
Well don't get carted away by mistake.
Hello, Leo.
Just the man I was looking for.
Will you do something for me ?
Yes, what ?
Take this letter.
But who to ?
Who to ?
Away to the farm, you silly.
What's the matter ?
But I can't.
Can't ? Why not ?
Because of Hugh.
What has Hugh to do with it ?
He might be upset.
What has Hugh got to do with it ?
I told you this is a business matter between Mr. Burgess and myself.
It has nothing to do with anybody else.
No one else in the world.
Do you understand, or are you too stupid ?
You and Hugh...
You and Trimingham...
What are you talking about ?
You come into this house. Our guest.
A poor little thing out of nowhere.
We take you in. We know nothing about you.
We feed you. We clothe you. We make a great fuss of you.
Then you have the damned cheek to say you won't do a simple thing that any... some roughneck lad out in the street would do for nothing.
Nothing !
You want paying, I suppose.
I see. How much do you want ?
Hello.
Mr. Postman.
How are you ?
You've been crying.
What's the matter ?
Here.
Do you want to have a shot with my gun ?
I was just going to clean it but I can do that afterwards.
Come and watch me then.
There are some rooks around here that could do with a peppering.
You got a letter for me ?
Looks as though you've been sleeping on it.
You'd like some tea, wouldn't you ?
I'm on me own today.
My daily woman doesn't come on Sundays.
Oh, you do have a woman every day ?
I told you. She doesn't come on Sundays.
Have you any message for her ?
Who ?
Marian.
I might have.
You want to take it ?
Not very much.
But she'll be angry if I don't.
So it was her.
It's not fair to ask you to do it for nothing.
What can I do to make it worth your while.
Last time I was here you said you'd tell me something.
I did that ?
Yes. You said you'd tell me about... spooning.
I don't know any other word.
Is there another word ?
You said you'd tell me.
Yes.
But now I'm not sure that I shall.
Why not ?
It's a job for your dad, really.
My father's dead.
And I'm quite sure he never did it.
Oh, yeah.
You can't break your promise.
Well, it means putting' your arm around a girl and kissin' her, that's what it means.
Oh, I know that.
But it's something else. It makes you feel something.
What do you like doing best ?
The kettle's boiling.
It's like whatever you like doing best.
And then some more.
Yes, but what more ?
What's a lover like ? What does it mean ?
What is a lover ?
What does a lover do ?
Are you a lover ?
What do you do ?
You know. I know you know.
And I won't take any more messages for you unless you tell me.
You get out of here, quick !
Dear mother,
I am sorry to tell you
I am not enjoying myself here.
I would like to come home.
Hello.
Come in.
Never been in here before ?
Sit down.
Cigar ?
No, thank you.
Can I ask you something ?
You can.
I've been reading a book. And in this book, two men fought a duel. Over a quarrel about one of the men's wife.
And then, in this duel... the wife's husband... the husband... was shot.
What's your question ?
Well, I thought, when I read it, that it was probably the lady's fault.
And I just thought that it was a little unfair.
Nothing is ever a lady's fault.
Does that answer your question ?
Yes.
Any other questions ?
What do you think of Ted Burgess ?
What do I think of Ted Burgess ?
He's a powerful hitter. But you had the measure of him.
You defeated him, didn't you ?
Ted Burgess is quite a decent fellow. But wild.
Wild ?
Do you mean he's dangerous ?
Well, he's not dangerous to you or to me.
He's a bit of a lady killer, that's all.
A lady killer ?
Sit down, please sit down.
A new recruit to the smoking room.
Have you been telling him some smoking-room stories ?
Or showing him the pictures ?
Have you looked at the pictures ?
He doesn't like them.
We were talking about Ted Burgess when you came in.
I told Leo... that he was a lady killer.
He has that reputation, I believe.
I've been talking to him about joining the army.
A likely man, single, no ties. And a pretty good shot too with a rifle by all acoounts.
He has that reputation, I believe.
Do you think he'll go ?
I think he may.
Seems quite interested.
He won't altogether be a loss to the district.
Why ?
For what you were saying just now.
They say he's got a woman up this way.
I know.
But she doesn't come on Sundays.
Cigar ?
I didn't think you'd come again.
I'm sorry I shouted at you. I didn't mean to.
I just didn't feel like telling you what you wanted to know, that's all.
But I'll tell you now, if you like.
Do you want me to tell you ?
Because I'll tell you now if you want me to.
No, no.
I wouldn't dream of troubling you.
I know someone who'll tell me.
As a matter of fact, I know several people who will tell me.
As long as they don't tell you wrong.
How could they ?
It's a common knowledge, isn't it ?
What are you doing with your bathing suit ?
I told Marcus you were going to give me a swimming lesson.
I've come to say goodbye, you see.
Oh, you're off, are you ?
I'm expecting to hear from my mother by Friday at the latest.
I think I really should go.
She does miss me, you know.
I'm sure she does.
Is it true you're going to the war ?
Who told you that ?
Lord Trimingham.
Did you know that Marian was engaged to him ?
Yes, I did.
Is that why you're going ?
I don't know that I am going.
That's for her to say.
It's not what I want. That's what she wants.
Well, goodbye.
So long, postman.
Goodbye, Ted.
Shall I take one more message for you ?
Tell her tomorrow's no good.
That Friday, after 5, same as usual.
So you met my grandson.
Yes, I did.
Does he remind you of anyone ?
Of course.
Ted Burgess.
That's it.
That's it.
He does.
Why don't you marry Ted ?
I can't.
Can't you see why ?
Why are you marrying Hugh ?
Because I must.
I must. I've got to.
Not that there's anything worth seeing. Apart from a lot of dreary old outhouses.
There's the deadly nightshade.
Oui, la belladonna.
You mean...
Atropa belladonna.
I don't mean that at all. I mean deadly nightshade.
Mama's ill in bed.
Why ?
I don't know.
What do you think of my mother ?
I think... she has a lot to look after. with the house and everything, and organizing the ball and everything.
She has, yes.
She undoubtedly has.
My sister is very beautiful, isn't she ?
Yes, she is very beautiful.
She's going to London tomorrow.
Firstly, to buy a dress for the ball, you oaf.
The engagement ball, you oaf.
And then, to get something for you.
What do you mean ?
A birthday present, frog's ball.
Now, shall I tell you what it is ? Or shall I not ?
Do you know what it is ?
But I don't tell little boys.
Well, you won't tell anyone I told you.
I swear.
It's a bicycle.
What ?
And you know what color it is ?
It's green.
Green, you imbecile. Bright green.
And you know why ?
Because you are green yourself.
It's your true color.
Green.
Green.
Green.
Did she say that ?
But of course.
Green.
Green.
Green.
Do you know where Marian is at this moment ?
Do you ?
Where ?
I don't tell little boys.
Little boy. Little boy.
Do you really know where she is ?
Dear Leo,
I think it would be ungrateful to Mrs. Maudsley, after all her kindness to you, if you were to leave so suddenly.
The ten days will soon pass, my darling, and then you'll be home.
We can't expect to be happy all the time, can we ?
Die.
Die, all evil.
Delenda est belladonna.
Delenda. Delenda.
Delenda est belladonna.
And now... today is Leo's day.
You've opened your presents.
At seven o'clock you'll cut your birthday cake, and receive a rather special present, so I believe.
Now, how would you like to spend the day ?
Unfortunately the weather's changed.
But if it clears, perhaps you'd like to go for a drive to Beeston Castle after luncheon.
You haven't seen it, have you ?
That would be very nice.
Well, we shall do that.
If the weather clears, we shall decide at luncheon.
What if the weather doesn't clear ?
Well, then we shall have to think again. We shall make our decision at luncheon.
Don't you think Huge ?
Quite a fair plan, I should say.
But it may not clear.
I think it will.
The rain seems to have stopped. For the moment, anyway.
It seems that all will be well for Leo's birthday.
Come with me and tell me what the weather means to do.
Do you think the summer's over ?
It's one of the hottest summer's on record, Marian.
Of course it isn't over.
Tell me, would you like to walk ?
Oh, yes.
I can't, I'm afraid.
You see, it's this kind of walk.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
What are you fighting about ?
Oh, I was just teaching him a lesson.
Was that the bone of contention ?
Yes, it was, mama.
I wanted him to take this note to nanny Robsy. To tell her that I'm going to see her this afternoon, some time.
And would you believe it ? Leo didn't want to. He pretended he had something on with Marcus.
Yes you did.
Well, I shouldn't really worry, Marian.
You say she often doesn't remember whether you've been or not.
She is growing old, poor nanny Robinson.
I think it's about time that Leo and I took a walk in the garden. Come on, Leo.
O don't believe you've seen the garden properly, have you ?
You can spare Leo now, can't you Marian ?
Oh, yes.
Would you like Marcus to come with us. Oh, no.
Marcus isn't interested in flowers. But you are, aren't you ?
Yes, I am.
Well now, here's the garden.
The rain has certainly stopped.
What kind of flowers truly interest you ?
Poisonous ones, really.
I don't think you'll find many of those.
But there is one in the out...
In the what ?
What have you seen, Leo ?
Well, there is a deadly nightshade in one of the outhouses.
Oh, you mean where the old garden used to be.
Yes, somewhere there.
Do you often go to the outhouses ?
Oh, no. Not often.
These always remind me of Marian.
How sweet of you to say you'd take her note to nanny Robinson.
Does she often send you with messages ?
Just once or twice.
It sort of worries me that I stopped you from going just now.
Perhaps you'd like to go.
Perhaps you'd like to go. You know the way, don't you ?
Well, not quite.
But I can ask.
You don't know the way ?
But I thought you had taken messages there before.
Well, yes, I have.
But you don't know the way.
I think perhaps the note should be delivered.
You have it in your pocket, haven't you ?
I'll call one of the gardeners and ask him to take it.
Oh, no, really !
It isn't really that important. Please don't bother.
It is important in a way, you see.
Stanton.
Could you come here a minute ?
We have a note here for Miss Robinson. Rather urgent.
Would you mind taking it ?
I haven't got it.
It must have fallen out of my pocket.
Feel again.
I must have dropped it.
Very well, Stanton.
Take your hands out of your pockets.
Has no one ever told you not to stand with your hands in your pockets ?
I could ask you to turn your pockets out.
But I won't do that.
I'll just ask you one question.
You say you've taken messages for Marian before.
Well, I... I think you said so.
If you don't take them to Nanny Robinson, to whom do you take them ?
So you met my grandson.
Yes, I did.
Does he remind you of anyone ?
Of course.
Ted Burgess.
That's it.
That's it.
He does.
It must be a comfort to you to have him near you.
Yes, but he doesn't come to see me very much.
I think he has a grudge against me.
Oh, surely not.
They tell me he wants to marry a girl. They tell me he wants to marry a girl.
But he won't ask her.
He feels... I think he feels... he's under some sort of spell or curse, you see.
That's just plain silly.
Now, this is where you come in.
I ?
Yes, you.
You know the facts. You know what really happened.
Tell him. Tell him everything, just as it was.
Every man should get married.
You ought to have married.
You're all dried up inside, I can tell that.
Don't you feel any need of love ?
Speak to him.
Tell him there's no spell or curse, except an unloving heart.
Tell him that.
We're watching the lightning, mama.
Rather good luck we didn't set out to Beeston Castle.
Yes, it would have been rather a damp expedition.
Sit here, please, Leo dear.
You see, I don't like number thirteen.
Isn't it silly of me ?
So we put twelve candles round the big cake and then when they're blown out, you shall light that one, and blow that one out.
When will that be ?
When Marian comes.
She has a rather special present for you.
She wants to give it to you herself.
Naturally.
And let's all sit down.
Marian should be back by six o'clock... from nanny Robinson.
I haven't seen nanny Robinson for years.
How is she ?
Remarkably well.
Isn't it time that Leo cut the cake ?
Yes, if he can do it.
That's unkind of you.
Of course he can do it.
He's a man of great capabilities.
Considerable.
And well loved.
Didn't you know he was Marian's cavalier ?
Bravo !
Leave a piece for Marian.
She ought to be here now.
It's still raining.
We'd better send a carriage down to fetch her.
Why didn't we think of it before ?
The carriage is to go at once to Miss Marian.
She may be walking up through the rain.
Poor darling. She'll be soaked.
What about your thirteenth candle ?
Now you must cut a piece for yourself.
He'd rather have his cake than eat it.
Let's have a round of crackers.
Here, dear. Come, hold one with me.
Now, all together...
Excuse me, Mam.
The carriage has come back.
But not Miss Marian.
She wasn't at Miss Robinson's and Miss Robinson said she hadn't been all day.
Well, all we can do is wait for her.
I've just learned a wonderful riddle. Listen to this.
What's the difference...
We won't wait.
I'm going to look for her.
You know where she is.
You shall show me the way.
Madeleine.
No !
You shall come !
You came out of the blue to make us happy. And we made you happy, didn't we ?
We trusted you with our great treasure.
You might never have known what it was.
You might have gone through life without knowing.
Isn't that so ?
You see, you can tell him, Leo.
You can tell him everything just as it was.
Hugh was as true as steel.
He wouldn't hear a word against me.
But everybody wanted to know us, of course.
I was Lady Trimingham, you see.
I still am. There is no other.
Remember how you loved taking our messages ? Bringing us together and making us happy.
Well, this is another errand of love.
And the last time I shall ever ask you to be our postman.
Our love was a beautiful thing, wasn't it ?
Tell him he can feel proud to be descended from our union. The child of so much happiness and beauty.
Tell him...
Legendas:
Lfbs
Is Godzilla your favorite?
He's a superman!
Come on, Ken, time for lunch.
Okay.
Darling.
Darling!
Good afternoon.
Oh, good afternoon, Gohei.
Got another interesting fish for my husband?
Some kind of strange fish that looks very weird to me.
Well, Professor, what kind of fish is it?
It's a tadpole, isn't it?
It's much too big to be a tadpole.
Anyway, they don't live in the sea.
Oh, yeah.
Where did you catch this?
Down on the point, where I usually get the shrimp.
I didn't catch a single one today.
With the fish getting worse every day, Suruga Bay is done for.
What in the world is this monster that appeared at the accident site in Suruga Bay?
Could it be some kind of sea monster? Or was it some kind of new military weapon?
Whatever it was, it has enough frightful power to destroy two ships.
Oh, that was a monster tadpole.
Papa, it's the same fish the old fisherman brought here today.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- That'll be 2:00.
- Right.
Now, set your watch.
Bye.
Man, it's empty.
Papa!
The tadpole!
Papa!
Papa.
Papa...
Papa. Please come back, Papa.
Ouch!
Papa!
Papa!
The monster that attacked you was smaller than the one that sunk the tanker.
Right.
There isn't just one Hedorah.
They come in different sizes, right, Papa?
Hedorah?
That's just a name my son dreamed up for them.
The Hedorah monsters came from the sludge.
Sludge?
Professor, is it possible that's the reason?
Well, maybe.
I'm not sure.
It's too early to say.
Excuse us.
Oh, no.
No pictures, please.
Yes, I want pictures taken.
I want people to see this on the television.
They need to realize how big the threat is.
Go ahead.
Hedorah got me too.
Since the first tragedy in Suruga Bay, other tankers have been involved in similar accidents.
The survivors tell us that in each instance, they saw a dark-colored monster.
This could be the work of Hedorah.
CHEERFUL
The atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb... cast their fallout into the sea.
Poison gases, sludge. Everyone throws them into the sea.
Even sewage.
Godzilla would really get angry if he saw this.
He would do something.
Class A, second grade, Ken Yano.
Darling, what are you doing up so late?
I put some muddy water in one of those test tubes.
Stop this.
You should be resting.
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.
This so-called tadpole is actually a mineral.
It's the same as diamonds and other crystallized carbons.
Papa.
Ken, what are you doing up?
Don't you know how late it is?
Papa, Godzilla's coming to save us.
Godzilla?
He's gonna come and kill Hedorah!
I saw it happen in my dream.
He'll come, won't he?
Mama, what do you think?
If you saw it in your dream, I'm sure he'll come.
Now it's time to go back to bed.
Papa.
I understand now.
This water is just muddy water.
Hedorah comes to life in polluted water, just like you thought.
Cool!
Look, Mama.
Now, these will join together too.
No wonder it can grow so quickly.
They combine when they meet each other.
So the Hedorah I saw, and the one that sank the tankers grew big this way.
This means they can reach enormous size.
Bigger than Godzilla?
Yep...
Hedorahs live in the chemicals we put in the sea.
If this thing came up on land, it would be a disaster!
But would a tadpole be able to come up on land?
You never know.
This is a new and unusual mutation.
We have to do something before it's too late.
Did you say Hedorah?
Knock it off!
Hedorah is a sea monster.
It's Godzilla!
Let's take a closer look.
Why is Godzilla here?
If the two monsters start fighting, they'll destroy the entire port.
Thirty-five are dead and eighty-one have been injured in the fight between Hedorah and Godzilla.
Three hundred and twenty-two buildings have been lost.
In areas that Hedorah passed through... metal objects have been completely corroded as if affected by some form of acid.
Is this terrestrial Hedorah the same monster that sank the tankers?
Where did Hedorah come from?
Why was Godzilla here?
There are still many unanswered questions regarding this strange event.
He doesn't know anything.
Godzilla came to beat Hedorah.
Right, Papa?
You know everything, don't you, Ken?
Is that your Godzilla impression?
- Brother, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Yukio seems to think you can be of some help.
Well, I might be able to find out what Hedorah really is with the help of Yukio and Miki.
Is this where you saw the sparks?
Yeah, that's right.
Papa.
This is it.
It's burnt.
It's ash from the sparks.
You want me to pick them up?
All that you can find.
It's exactly like the tadpole.
So it came onto land after it changed like a frog does.
That may be the case... but is it possible for a living organism to be made up of minerals?
You're sure you saw sparks coming from it?
Yes, without a doubt.
It was very beautiful.
And it didn't eat the cat it captured, but inhaled smoke from the smokestacks instead.
That smoke should be toxic to any living animal.
I know.
Hedorah is completely different from all other life on earth.
The colored, gooey stuff is waste material.
The white, shiny stuff is the crystallized carbon.
It's a mineral I think we should call hedrium.
What you see there is the eyeball of the tadpole ground into powder.
Hedrium is as good a name as any I can think off... but I think the white substance is the key to the lifeforce of the monster.
If its body is formed by minerals and waste material... it wouldn't have a nerve structure as we know it.
It wouldn't be unusual for it to spark if Godzilla breathed fire on it.
If Hedorah lived off of our smoke, wouldn't that end our air-pollution problem?
Don't be ridiculous.
Hedorah is much more dangerous.
Why did all that metal corrode?
Take another look.
That yellow substance you see there that's sulfur.
Hedrium is probably a catalyst that produces sulfur when it reacts with other substances.
Sulfur is a component of sulfuric acid.
The burns on my face are very similar to burns caused by sulfuric acid.
The small particles in sulfuric acid create a sulfuric acid mist that corrodes metal.
If Hedorah consumes our smoke and releases a sulfuric acid mist it wouldn't clean our air.
We'll be enveloped in a poisonous smog.
The appearance of Hedorah, believed to have formed in polluted bays... has placed the entire country in a state of terror.
Hedorah appears to avoid daylight... but the threat of another landing remains on rainy or foggy days.
Residents within one kilometer of rivers or the ocean should stay on alert.
Especially along industrial coastlines where pollution is a problem...
Forget all this Hedorah talk until you get better.
Fine.
I was just watching the news.
Papa, if Hedorah isn't from this planet, then how did it get here?
Ken, do you know what a meteor is?
"A shooting star that falls to earth."
That's right.
Hedorah must have been on a rock that landed on earth.
I wonder what kind of planet it came from.
Hedorah probably came from a sticky, dark planet far, far away.
Now, let's go to sleep.
- Stop!
Stop!
- Careful!
Be careful!
I saw Godzilla.
Hedorah must be here too!
Hedorah wouldn't come on a nice day like this.
Ken!
He's so hard to keep up with.
Yes.
What?
Godzilla?
It's true!
Right, go to your mother's school and come home together.
Ken?
What's wrong?
Ken!
Hello?
Hello?
One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight.
Teacher!
My throat!
What was it?
Girls!
Michiko!
Quickly, come along, girls.
We must go inside.
Hurry!
Everyone, help each other.
Gas tanks at the Japan Oil Company have exploded.
Residents in the area, evacuate immediately.
The fire may spread.
Residents, please evacuate immediately.
It'd be faster to walk.
Now, don't get impatient.
Something wrong?
I don't know.
What is that? !
Run for it!
Ouch!
Anti-Hedorah Oxygen Masks Now on Sale
The southwestern area of Fuji City has virtually been destroyed.
So far, 1600 people have been killed, while the number of injured exceeds 30,000.
Hedorah has left a trail of very high levels of sulfuric acid mist ranging from 2000 ppm to 2800 ppm, affecting rescue workers' eyes and throats.
Dead bodies are reportedly piling up in the streets.
It was so frightening when the students started collapsing.
That's no learning environment.
If this continues, there's no telling how bad it will get.
Will Hedorah just get bigger and bigger, Papa?
If we don't get rid of the pollution, he'll just keep growing.
As it gets bigger, it'll absorb more pollutants into itself and it'll be able to go anywhere.
Will it climb Mount Fuji?
It might.
Ken, do you know what a nuclear explosion is?
The atomic and hydrogen bombs.
Yes.
Atomic nucleus When the atoms of a given substance undergo nuclear fission... they create different atoms and emit a tremendous amount of energy.
In space, there are explosions much bigger than atomic bombs, even bigger than the sun.
Bang!
That's wild.
Hedorah is probably flying by means of its own nuclear power.
After all, it is a space creature made up of metal components.
There's no telling what kind of destructive power it may develop.
Could it become more powerful than Godzilla?
It's possible.
But, you see, there's only one Hedorah.
If everyone pulls together, we can defeat it.
Can't we do something?
The next time the monster lands, we must have something ready to destroy it.
It has to have a weakness.
Why don't we dry it?
It's only sludge.
Hedorah has won after all.
Everything produces waste.
We humans created Hedorah with ours.
A million people...on the go.
How about that?
We'll get all the young people.
Then we'll throw a huge party on top of Mount Fuji before Hedorah gets to it.
1.
Aquatic Phase When Hedorah first appeared, it looked like a huge tadpole, sinking tankers left and right.
This is its aquatic phase.
On a foggy night, it transformed into a creature like a four-legged reptile... absorbing smoke from smokestacks, growing steadily.
It transformed into a saucer-like flier and spread large amounts of sulfuric acid mist over the city in broad daylight.
The question now is:
What terrifying form will the monster take next?
Professor, what do you think?
Its growth rate is frightening.
I have no idea what it will do.
Then what is Hedorah's weakness?
Well, you see... Hedorah lives in a world in which no earthly creature can exist.
A negative world of death.
That is to say, it lives in sludge and polluted air.
So it's possible that oxygen might deter its growth.
Give them oxygen! That'll do it!
Yeah!
Who gave birth to Hedorah?
Neither the land nor the sea is suitable for life.
What will Hedorah do next?
Oh, thank you.
One positive electrode and one negative.
Feed the electric current and anything between them dries instantly.
It's been tested in Hokkaido as a way to dry out the fields.
Well, let's try it.
You'll use this to dry out Hedorah?
That's right.
Good.
We just need to increase the size of the model.
Call the Self-Defense Force.
Orders have been given for the entire Self-Defense Force... including the reserve forces, to guard the main industrial cities.
The government issued orders for all factories to cease production... and placed restrictions on movement of vehicles.
Over 10 million people in Tokyo, Osaka and other large cities... are suffering from the effects of the sulfuric acid mist.
I thought a million people were coming.
There's only a hundred.
Why complain about it?
Green pastures exist only in our hearts now.
Let's sing.
Let's dance!
Let's at least use our energy to make a stand!
All right, let's do it!
It is 5:40 p.m. This is a special news bulletin.
Hedorah has made landfall and is heading north.
It seems to have grown to a size of at least 60 meters long.
Self-Defense Forces along the coast have fired at Hedorah... but the bullets shot straight through it with no effect as it continues in its destruction.
Toshie!
Toshie!
Darling!
Make a phone call for me.
I can sense it.
Godzilla is here.
That means Hedorah is here too.
Are you sure?
Good, it's Godzilla!
He's here!
Get him, Godzilla!
Hello, Self-Defense headquarters?
The electrodes. Have you finished making the electrodes?
What?
You're constructing it in Sakaizawa?
Hedorah's in the Mount Fuji area?
Please do your best.
Ken is in danger.
He's not the only one.
Every living thing is in danger.
Toshie, we must go to Mount Fuji.
You're in no condition to travel.
If the electrodes fail there's no way of stopping Hedorah.
The survival of this planet depends on those electrodes.
Look!
The fire.
Get your torches!
Drop the oxygen!
Here we are. Are you all right?
Professor, the electrodes are ready.
Good.
We've set up the electrodes one kilometer apart.
They are 40 meters tall and 60 meters wide.
How do you plan on getting Hedorah to come between the electrodes?
We bait it with artillery and helicopters.
When it's close, we'll use blinking headlights and supersonic waves.
- What's the voltage?
- Three million volts.
We're rerouting all the electricity from the Kanto and Chubu areas here.
The power lines are down! Repair them immediately!
Headquarters!
Temporarily stop current transmission!
Unit One!
Unit One, report!
We've lost contact.
- What about Unit Two?
- It's on its way, sir.
- Hurry! - Yes, Sir!
It's coming.
The headlights.
Use the headlights. You've got to get its attention.
But we still don't have power.
If you don't use them, it'll leave here.
- Hurry!
- Please do as he says.
Hey, blink the lights!
- Aren't the repairs done yet?
- Almost.
When will you be finished?
! In about 10 more minutes!
How close to us is it now?
About 100 meters.
It's stopped.
Stupid bastard!
It's coming.
Is it ready yet?
Another five minutes.
We don't have time!
You've got one minute.
You've got 30 seconds!
Okay!
Is it ready?
Do we have any power?
Hurry, we need the power now!
We've got full power now!
You damn fool!
It's too late!
Hey, they're coming right for us.
All right, turn it on!
Open circuits!
Now what?
I think we blew a fuse.
It's no good. Why can't anything be done right?
Godzilla!
Godzilla!
Godzilla, goodbye!
There was another murder.
They're looking for Jack the Ripper.
It's you!
It's you they're looking for!
Anna...
It's very cold here, Granny.
It's lonely.
Very lonely.
'It's so cold, Granny. So cold.'
Mary, dear, listen carefully to Granny.
Is there no one with you in the spirit world to play with, dear?
Is there no one at all?
'It's very lonely, Granny.'
Well, look around you, dear.
Is there no one at all with you?
There must be someone with you.
Oh, I don't think you're trying, dear.
Look behind you.
'Yes.'
Who is it, dear?
See who it is.
Look hard for Granny, dear, please.
'I-It's a little girl like me.
'A little girl.'
Ask her her name, dear.
Find out her name.
Not her spirit name, dear. We wouldn't know her spirit name down here, would we?
She says her name's Claudia.
She's very nice but her dress, it's all wet.
It's Claudia!
Claudia, my baby.
Claudia, can you hear Mama?
'Claudia, speak to Mama, please.'
I hear voices, strange voices, but I can't make out what they're saying.
What is happening?
I don't understand the foreign language.
Italian?
Is it Italian?
La poverina.
I see a boat.
There's been an accident.
Is that what I see?
I see a boat and I see water.
Lots of water.
- A lake...
- Claudia, can you hear me?
Speak to me.
Please.
Is Claudia happy, Mary?
Ask the little girl, is she happy, dear?
It's Granny, dear.
Ask the little girl, is she happy?
Can you hear me, Mary?
You must try, dear, or Granny will get very annoyed.
We've lost contact with the spirit world.
Oh, please try.
If the spirits won't cooperate, there's nothing we can do this end.
According to the stars, the spirits should be very auspicious next Wednesday, if you'd like to try again.
I can spare a little time about 8:30 if you'd like to pass by then.
Mrs Golding, as a student of the occult I've never witnessed such close contact with the spirit world.
A truly amazing talent, madam.
A very natural talent, Mr Dysart.
Very natural talent, madam.
- I'll do all I can to help. - Thank you.
We're very grateful.
- Till Wednesday, then.
This was your first visit to a medium, then, Mr Pritchard?
Yes, it is.
The young have no interest in spirits. There are so few people they know who are dead.
As one gets older, one finds that death separates us more and more from loved ones. I wager you find that true, Dr Pritchard?
Yes, Mrs Golding.
Get off!
- My dear young lady!
- What are you doing, girl?
- Did I hurt you?
Yes, you did, sir...
I mean, no, of course you didn't, sir.
What are you doing down here?
She loves to listen to the spirit voices.
Run along now.
I told her, she mustn't loiter down here when I've got customers... Guests...
She doesn't listen to a word I say.
Your child, Mrs Golding?
I took her in from an orphanage some years ago, out of the goodness of my heart.
Her mother was done in, I fear.
She's a trifle touched, I'm afraid.
God knows what happened to her father if she ever had one.
But one has to do all one can for the poor creatures of this world. Don't you agree, Dr Pritchard?
Yes, Mrs Golding. One must.
Good night, gentlemen.
For a music hall turn, it was entertaining.
Music hall turn?
Criminal deception.
That poor woman was driven to hysteria.
Mrs Golding's a bloodsucker making money out of human grief.
A letter or two in the press should put her and her like out of business for good.
Sorry, my boy. I can't expect you to be interested in my pet causes.
- Home now, Pleasants, if you please.
- Home? - Tonight's my stag party.
- So soon?
Laura arrives tomorrow, the wedding's only six days away.
- How these things catch up on one.
- I wouldn't phrase it that way.
We'll talk later.
You take the carriage. I might walk home.
Run along to your club, my boy.
- Good night.
- Have a good time.
Like a cab, sir?
I can run down the Strand and get you one, sir.
Very well.
Oh, it's like selling my own flesh and blood.
I'll never forgive myself.
The poor little dear is only 17.
Oh, come now. It's bound to happen.
Sooner than later if I'm any judge of the girl.
You will be kind to her.
She is an innocent girl.
She'd better be at that price.
If I wasn't desperate for money, I'd never allow this.
Of course not.
Hello, my dear.
Don't be frightened, my dear.
Surely your aunt told you I was going to pay you a visit tonight?
Yes, sir.
Shall we close this, my dear?
Makes things more cosy, hmm?
Oh, come on!
I've brought you a little present, Anna.
Look.
What do you think of that, eh?
I'll wager you've never had anything as pretty as that before, have you?
It's all precious stones, you know.
How do you like it?
It's all yours, you know.
I say, girl, are you all right?
What's the trouble, eh?
Look, damn it, what are you playing at?
Is this some sort of trick?
Come on.
You're not dealing with some rustic on his first night in London.
Get up!
Come on, you little bitch! Get up! - Get up!
- Stop it! Stop it, Mr Dysart.
She's only a poor, innocent girl.
Look, you old bitch, you're not putting me off with this game.
There, there, Anna.
It's all right. It happens to all of us.
Mr Dysart didn't mean to hurt you.
Oldest trick there is. I expect you've sold her as a virgin before.
- Never!
- Well, I'll have my way with her or I'll have my money back...
Stop it!
Stop it, Mr Dysart!
All right, then. There's your money.
Good grief, woman! Have you no sense of values? !
There, there, dear.
It's all right now.
Look what you've done...!
Right, now. Come on.
Out you come.
One fact is abundantly clear, gentlemen... whoever impaled that woman possessed immense strength.
In going through your individual statements, however, I've found details that do not... shall we say, provide a clear picture.
Inspector, I have a number of urgent appointments in the Commons.
Mr Dysart, I shall endeavour not to keep you longer than necessary.
Now, then...
Mr and Mrs Wilson. You were the first to leave Mrs Golding's house, once the so-called chat with the spirit world was concluded.
- That is correct.
- You came out of the house, got into the carriage and were driven away.
- Did you see anyone leave after you?
Are you absolutely certain?
My wife was upset. I didn't notice much beyond that fact.
Then, Dr Pritchard, you left with your son.
My son took our carriage to his club, as I told you in my statement.
I sent a boy to the Strand to fetch me a cab.
When the cab was arriving, I heard the scream.
And when did you leave the house, Mr Dysart?
Shortly after the Pritchards.
The door was hardly closed.
- I told you all this.
- Then, Dr Pritchard, you must have seen Mr Dysart leave the house.
- No, I did not.
- But you were across the street.
Perhaps, Mr Pritchard, you noticed Mr Dysart?
I'm afraid not.
I hope you realise what you're suggesting.
Perhaps you can explain why you were not seen leaving by Dr and Mr Pritchard who were 20 feet away?
Inspector, it occurs to me that if Mr Dysart left two minutes after us, it's possible we didn't see him because we were on the far side of our carriage.
Yes, Dr Pritchard. That is a possibility that occurred to me.
It is a possible explanation.
Of course. How stupid of me.
I remember the carriage now.
It slipped my mind.
Will you stand up, Mr Dysart?
Dr Pritchard, you are the only witness I have.
I ask you to observe Mr Dysart with care.
Could Mr Dysart possibly be the man you saw leave Mrs Golding after she screamed?
It was dark. Could you possibly be mistaken, Doctor?
Think, please, before you answer.
No, I don't think it was Mr Dysart, Inspector.
It was a much larger man.
I'm afraid the villain of this piece seems to have escaped you, Inspector.
She got herself lost, Mr Michael.
I knew it.
Poor, poor girl.
Mrs Bryant, I'd be obliged if you didn't use that expression.
There's nothing poor about Laura.
I'm waiting for my fiancé.
He should be here in a moment.
Oh, my love, at last!
Oh, it's been a year and four days, and the four days were the longest.
It'll never happen again, I promise you.
- Welcome home, Miss Laura.
- Oh, Nanny Bryant.
Now I now I'm really home at last.
My father couldn't make it, due to "pressure of business".
Your poor father. He works too hard.
Things have changed.
He's now a follower of this man Freud.
He calls himself a psychoanalyst.
Now, now, you two. You're not married yet.
Mrs Bryant has orders to keep us in sight until we're married.
I'm to stay at my club.
- The carriage, Miss Laura.
- It's Pleasants!
How nice to hear your voice again.
Drive slowly, so that Michael can relate to me all that is happening.
We questioned her, Doctor, but she's no memory of the murder.
None at all?
A complete withdrawal?
I see.
We're not certain it wasn't too much for the girl's mind.
With Ms Golding gone, who'll look after her?
It'll be the streets for her, like so many others.
Come in, dearie, why don't you? Come and see how royalty live. Only half a crown.
Perhaps as a doctor, I may be able to help.
She'd be grateful, Doctor.
Want me to put on a show for the doc, Inspector?
- Come for Little Miss Muffet?
- Come along, you lot.
Move away there.
Dirty bitches have taken her clothes, Inspector.
Right. That's enough. Let the gentleman through.
Stop that!
Don't you do that to me.
You'll get your turn. Watch it!
Anna?
Do you remember me, Anna?
Yes, sir. I remember you.
Do you know where we're going, Anna?
We're going to my home.
I'm going to look after you from now on.
No, you'll be quite safe.
There'll be no more seances... with you playing the ghost.
No more gentlemen calling on you in the middle of the night.
- You'll lead a very different life.
- Will I work in the kitchens?
No, Anna.
I have a perfectly fine, cook, housekeeper and a maid.
All you will have to do is to learn to become one of the family.
- Family, sir?
We're here, sir.
Here we are.
We're home.
Thank you, sir.
Do you approve?
It's beautiful!
Well, let's go in.
This will be your room, Anna.
This used to be my wife's room.
She died a long time ago.
But from now on, it will known as Anna's room.
Dolly, help Miss Anna in any way that you can. Yes, sir.
Well, Anna. Are you pleased?
Well, I... see from that that you are.
Dolly, the first thing to do is get Miss Anna bathed and dressed. Yes, sir.
I'll get the bath ready.
Perhaps you could find something from my wife's wardrobe suitable for Miss Anna to wear for dinner. Yes, sir.
There's the pink dress. Miss Anna will look lovely in that.
Dolly seems to know where everything is, so don't hesitate to ask her for anything that you may want.
Don't you worry, sir.
You'll never recognise her, sir.
Come on, Miss Anna.
Pleasants, bring the luggage.
Yes, Mr Michael.
Oh, Michael, it's so good to be back.
Three steps down...
Oh, and here's the umbrella stand...
Here's your knobbly old stick, do you remember that?
Oh, it's that horrible old clock.
I remember that, too.
We broke it.
And study door...
And the mirror, which no longer holds any interest for me at all.
And the table, the chair... and the Chinese vase... and now the stairs... - Laura...
- Oh, Michael, you've moved.
You've got the wrong man, Laura.
Dr Pritchard. I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
How are you, Laura?
I hope you had a pleasant voyage.
- In the guest room, Pleasants.
- Isn't Laura having Mother's room?
I'm afraid not. We already have a guest.
- May I ask what guest, Father?
- Oh, I can learn a room in minutes.
It's no problem. I'm only here for a few days.
It's that girl from Mrs Golding's.
They were keeping her in the cells amongst... very dubious company.
I've said that she may stay here with us.
You've brought her here?
Would you come down a moment, my dear?
This is my son Michael. You remember him?
- Welcome to our home, Anna.
- Thank you, sir.
- This is my fiancée Laura.
- Hello, Anna.
- Laura is blind, my dear.
- Oh, don't be worried.
It's just a nuisance.
I see with my hands.
Dolly, take Miss Anna to have her bath.
Come along, Miss Anna.
And I must get back to work.
See you at dinner later, Laura.
Call Mrs Bryant and get her to show Laura to her room.
What a kind man he is.
I've been expecting you.
Doctor, I've no idea why you saw fit to save me from great embarrassment but I'm much obliged to you, sir.
It was a misunderstanding... one which could have ruined my parliamentary career. Yes, Mr Dysart.
Being hanged could have ruined your neck, as well.
I don't wish to slight your contribution but it wouldn't have gone that far.
Really?
Mr Dysart, either you or Anna killed Mrs Golding.
Oh, come now!
Surely you don't think a respectable Member of Parliament goes about murdering people.
If you even suspected I was guilty, why did you lie to save me?
Because it suited my purpose.
My knowledge of certain mental diseases leads me to suspect one of you.
- I could be wrong.
- I saw it.
She was possessed.
Her whole body was contorted.
Her hands...
- They weren't her hands.
- Really?
Whose were they?
How should I know? She was possessed.
If she wasn't, how could she manage, a frail girl, to drive the poker through flesh and bone plus an inch and a half oak door?
The hysteria accompanying certain disorders can produce extraordinary strength.
- The other being that I did it?
A possibility.
I don't understand.
If you thought I committed a crime that brutal, we'd hardly be discussing it about your home.
- Anna is upstairs at this moment.
- She's what?
I intend to study her.
To do that, she must remain in my care.
Damn it, she's a possessed being, as savage as any beast.
Listen to me.
Since time began, men have been murdering one another.
When it happens, we hunt the murderer down and use the law to murder him in return.
We've tortured him, burned him alive, disembowelled him, though nowadays we're more humane... we simply hang him.
And all this time, we have never once tried to understand him, to find out why. Why one human being murders another human being.
So we go on having murders and murdering in revenge.
Only the graveyard worms are richer.
- But she was possessed...
- Nonsense!
I believe the girl is suffering from a disorder of the mind, possibly brought on by some terrifying experience in childhood. Maybe it was congenital, but it has divided her mind.
There's an Austrian doctor called Freud who studied this. It's called schizophrenia.
He also used a new science called psychoanalysis to explore the mind and its disorders, to find out why. This is the technique I would like to use with Anna but I need your help.
Now perhaps you can understand my behaviour at the police station.
I want you to use your position to find out about her past... her family, where she lived, everything.
The slightest detail could be vital to understanding her condition.
- What if she murders somebody else?
- She won't.
Even if she did, to understand the psychology of murder would be worth the risk.
And if I refuse?
I might just remember who it was I saw leaving the house after the murder. With greater accuracy this time.
You'd better go the way you came.
One thing you've got to learn around here is to affect what Dr Pritchard calls a happy countenance, which means he likes to see people with smiles on their faces, he does.
Not that he's one for smiles and giggles himself, know what I mean?
- Not like us.
- I wasn't crying because I was sad, I was crying because I was happy.
- It's such a beautiful room.
Oh, it's all right.
Anna, at my age, one treats modesty as an affectation of the ugly.
It'll fit Miss Anna a treat, sir.
See how this goes with the dress.
Oh, sir. It's lovely!
We'll be at the restaurant within the hour, as soon as I can leave the embassy.
I've left you the carriage. Pleasants will see you to the door.
Don't let her out of your sight until she's in the carriage.
She's had a disturbing day. She needs company. All right, sir.
You're going to look like a proper princess tonight.
You just wait and see.
- Here.
Ooh, it's a tight fit.
Goodness, look at the time.
Oh, darling, your holding me like this is ruining our reputations, but I could do it all night.
- Then we shall.
- When we're married, please.
But now there's no more music, and your father's waiting.
Oh, Father...
Oh, it's so hot.
- Let's go back and dance.
- No. My feet hurt. I'm sitting down.
- I'm so hot.
- To your right.
That's better.
The dancing's made me thirsty.
Oh, my goodness.
It's all right.
I must leave. I'm worried about Anna.
She should have arrived by now.
- We shan't be late.
- Mrs Bryant will look after you. Thank you, Dr Pritchard.
I'm sorry. Something seems to have spoilt the evening for your father.
But not for me.
Oh, Dolly. It's so beautiful.
I'm afraid to move for fear I'll wake up.
You're not asleep, Miss Anna.
Here. Take a look at the back.
Do you have to all me "Miss"?
I'd much prefer us to be friends.
No, that would never do.
You can't have the likes of me talking to a lady on such familiar terms.
- But I'm not a real lady yet.
- Wait till you see yourself in this.
Oh, Miss Anna, you're going to look lovely tonight.
Everybody's going to be looking at you.
You're going to be the belle of the ball, you just wait and see.
It'll look lovely on that dress.
Oh, Miss Anna, do you like it?
Oh, you do like it. I knew you would.
Miss Anna, you look just like a little doll, all done up to meet the queen.
I'll kiss you now, then, before you become a lady.
Pleasants, go to the restaurant and tell Mr Michael that you're waiting.
- I'll take a cab if I need one. - Very good, sir.
Give it to me, Anna.
Give it to me.
I will keep it for you.
Stay here.
Stay here.
Come with me.
What am I doing here?
- We should be at the restaurant.
- It's all right.
It's very late.
You're becoming very sleepy.
Yes, I am. Very sleepy.
- Has anything happened?
- Nothing, my dear.
You dozed off and had a bad dream.
You came back and found me asleep.
Oh, I'm so ashamed.
- Ah, this is what I was looking for. - Dr Pritchard.
It's all right, Mrs Bryant.
Laura's capable of putting herself to bed.
You must get your sleep, considering the heavy time ahead of us.
The wedding arrangements.
That Dolly promised to wake me up when you came in, sir.
Where has the girl gone?
I'm afraid we've lost our Dolly, Mrs Bryant.
As Anna and I were leaving, a man brought a message from Dolly's mother.
I never knew she had one.
I'd never heard her speak of her mother.
Apparently, her mother's gravely ill.
There was nothing I could do but send her off to give what help she could.
- She was terribly upset.
- That kind of girl does come and go.
All young girls today lack character. It's a fact.
Can I get you anything, Doctor?
No, thank you.
I just came back for this.
I shall be here when Laura returns, so there's no need to stay up.
If you're certain that I won't be needed, I think I will take a little rest.
- I'll call if I need you.
It's time you were up, Miss Anna.
Come, now, Miss Anna, it's way past noon.
If you don't get up, it'll be too late to bother getting up at all.
- Oh, this is disgraceful.
Let her sleep.
I gave her a sedative last night.
I want you to keep an eye on her.
I don't want her to leave the house.
Is she not well, Doctor?
- It isn't contagious, is it?
It's just that she needs rest and care, that's all.
Whatever you say, Doctor.
There you are, Pritchard.
Your message suggested, as well as hysteria, that you've had success.
Doctor, being a scientist, you'll find nothing I say about possession believable.
So you've found someone to say it for you?
As you know, our dear Queen Victoria herself...
Really, Dysart, the beliefs of that dear lady have no interest for me.
- What have you found out about Anna?
- Nothing whatsoever.
I've checked newspapers, police files, all without success.
However, I have contacted a certain personage.
The Royal Medium, Madame Bullard.
Please, Dysart, not a seance.
Madame Bullard has kindly consented to give you an interview tomorrow.
I advise you to go.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
I know very well what I'm dealing with.
Unless you keep that appointment tomorrow, I'm going to the police.
Now, Anna, we're going on a voyage, you and I, back in time to when you were a very little girl.
I want you to try and remember as far back as you can.
Try and search in your mind for that time when you were very, very small.
Do you remember you mother, Anna?
What was she like?
She wore a silk dress... with a frill around the bottom.
There was a fire in the grate, and it was warm.
'Sometimes...'
'Sometimes?
' 'Sometimes I'd sit on her lap by the fire. Sometimes on the rug.'
- There were bars.
- Where?
Around my bed.
There were bars around my bed.
And it got very cold.
The fire died away very slowly.
It got very, very cold.
My mother kept... kept lying there so still... for a long time... staring at me.
Yes, Anna.
Rest, Anna.
- I can't let you go.
- We'll be all right.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you, but Mr Michael and Miss Laura, they're being very rebellious.
We're only going out to dinner.
I can hardly chaperone them and look after Miss Anna and yourself as well.
I'm only a singular person.
Yes, you're quite right. Go with them to dinner.
Anna and I can manage.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Hurry up, Nanny.
You're a bit young for this game.
Get off home!
'Ere you.
What are you doin'?
Hello, there.
You lost yourself, have you, my dear?
You're a bit young for this game, aren't you?
Them old bags up there'll have your hair off if they catch you on their beat.
Let's look at you.
Nice little thing.
When I started, it was a different kettle of fish.
Every girl for herself.
None of this business of having your territory.
Ooh, there was lovely houses in them days, all crystal and silk hangings, and lovely gentlemen to tip you a guinea just for luck.
Come on, dearie.
No, it's all too regulated now, dear, what with the police on you and the price of gin what it is, and how even so-called nice ladies act!
You can't tell the professionals from the amateurs!
Oh, now... Bloody key.
Oh, there we are.
Now, watch your step, dear.
There you are.
Nice little thing, she is.
There. That's put some light on the subject.
Now, a pretty young girl like yourself, you've got to start out right.
And the right way isn't by tramping up and down on some street what's already being solicited on.
Now, I'll just take a little drop of this, dear... for my throat.
No, you see, that's what could have put all those girls in such a temper.
But don't you worry, dear.
Long Liz is gonna look after you.
I'm looking for a girl, this tall, in a cloak. Have you seen her?
- I've seen many girls pass.
- Have you seen this one?
- Round by the Crown and Trumpet.
- If it's a real woman you want...
No, even though the good days is gone for all of us, there's still good pickings to be made. Especially for the likes of you... at your age.
You're quite a pretty little thing.
Stand up, m'dear.
Oh, you're a bit modest there for most gentlemen's taste, but not to worry, they'll get plumper in time, and a few little tricks I know.
Oh, poor little thing, shivering with the cold?
It's a wonder you didn't freeze.
Time you and I...
I'm looking for a girl wearing a cloak.
Have you seen her?
- I'll pay you well.
- That must be the new one.
Yeah, we saw her. She'll remember us, too. Right little grabber.
I shouldn't have thought she was enough woman for you.
- Where is she?
- Where's that money?
- Liz took her back to her place.
- Oh, yeah.
- Who's Liz?
Where does she live? - Liz likes the little girls.
- Where does she live?
- Not so bloody hard!
Hands off me!
Don't squeeze the fruit unless you're buying it.
- Tell me where to find this Liz!
- Blimey! There she is now!
Cab?
Hey, you!
That bloke's all right. He was with us when we found Long Liz.
'In sickness and in health...'
- For better and for worse...
- Till death us do part...
And even then, I plight thee my troth.
If anyone here assembled knows just cause why this couple should not be joined in holy wedlock, let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
- I know of one very just cause, sir.
If you go any further, they'll be properly married at their rehearsal.
Quite right, Doctor.
It's true, you know.
Once when I was a very young curate, I got so carried away that I prematurely spliced the couple right on the spot.
- When do we rehearse the kissing?
- I was wondering the same thing.
Laura, I believe you'd like a little practice finding the register?
- Yes, please.
- The rest of you may stand easy while we sort out the stroll to the vestry.
Step up now.
Why are you crying, Anna?
Because it's all so beautiful.
They look so lovely and happy.
I don't know what I'll do at the real wedding.
Come, Anna.
- Dr Pritchard, do you think...?
I want you to think of me as a friend, to trust me.
Would it help if you called me John?
- Oh, no, sir.
I couldn't. - Well, I won't have "sir", and Dr Pritchard sounds much too formal.
- Dr John. - Hmm.
- You were going to ask something?
- Yes, I was wondering...
"Even then, I plight thee my troth."
Do you think we know each other in that other world, Dr John?
- What do you mean?
- Well, at Mrs Golding's sometimes,
I know I was only pretending... but sometimes I got into their world.
They were so mad, so full of hate... unhappy.
- Last night...
- That was just a bad dream, Anna.
- I told you, a bad dream.
- No. No, I felt them coming to me so clearly.
Anna, there are no such things as spirits.
This is nonsense. - I want you to meet a certain lady.
- Is she a doctor, too?
No, she's not a doctor.
Trust me.
A gentleman and young lady to see you, madame.
- They gave no name.
- Ask them to come in, Maude.
They are expected.
Do come in.
And be seated.
This is Miss Anna.
Hello, my dear.
- What a pretty dress you have on.
- Thank you, madame.
- I hear you have lost your past.
- It's facts I need, madame.
- I can only tell you what I see.
- What the crystal ball reveals?
Sir, I do not really understand the process myself, but I use no apparatus, unless I can call myself apparatus.
No crystal ball, not even tea leaves.
Sorry if I disappoint you. Shall I proceed?
Oh, what a very pretty little face you have, my dear.
Don't be alarmed. Nothing I do will harm you.
I've often helped people to find their past, an sometimes it can be such a very pleasant exper...
There is a violence in this girl.
Quite sudden. It's still there now.
Something horribly violent. Something to do with someone close to her.
I see a room, firelight, a red carpet... a bed and a child.
A little girl is in the bed.
There is a woman, her mother, and a man, her fa... Yes.
Her father.
He's well-dressed, well-spoken. A nobleman.
His clothes are years ago.
There's blood on his clothes.
He is a man who murders.
The little girl... it is Anna.
She's alone. There is a woman on the floor, lying there, still.
Blood.
The man has murdered the mother of his child.
And that child... That child is Anna.
Who is this man?
Why, it's...
Oh, my God!
He's the Ripper!
Who was it?
Who was this man?
I must know!
I can't tell you.
But I warn you, the violence of that man is still in this girl.
She is what I would call possessed.
Poor child!
There, there. It's all right.
Don't be frightened.
You're all right now.
Poor child.
Come along, Anna. It's time for us to go.
Why?
Giddy-up.
- What the devil do you want?
- What did Madame Bullard say?
Nothing.
A lot of mumbo jumbo about Jack the Ripper being her father.
- I knew it!
- He's been dead years.
- That explains it.
- Rubbish. It's not a fact.
- If Madame Bullard...
- She's a fake!
Dysart, I'm beginning to make progress.
I'm discovering the causes of her actions.
I will cure her.
You can't cure Jack the Ripper!
- That's who she is!
Listen to me.
Come, Anna.
Now, lie down, Anna.
Now you're feeling very tired, Anna.
Her condition is induced by nothing more than a flickering light.
Do you remember where this began?
She used to hide behind a grille at Mrs Golding's.
The firelight flickering through the grille set up a conditioning, which she associated with this spirit world nonsense.
She's an emotional, sensitive girl.
In reaction against the terrors of the world she grew up in, her mind went into revolt.
It sought every opportunity available to forget, to escape into a safer world, where no one could intrude... or inflict pain... or lust.
While the light flickered, Anna felt safe. She felt needed and useful.
So, in moments of stress, her mind seized on any similar pattern to escape.
You may be right, but she's a murderer, a murderer's daughter.
You can't escape that.
- Murder must be punished.
- Please, let me prove my theory.
Anna, I want you to open your eyes and look at something.
Can you see it, Anna?
I remember.
I thought it was lost.
Now, look at it again, Anna.
Thank you, Anna.
Now I want you to close your eyes and sleep again.
Rest, Anna...
You're very tired.
- She's perfectly safe in that state.
- How can a murderer be safe? ! What sets her off?
Why does she kill?
I haven't discovered what triggers her violence but when I do...
Don't you see? I'm near a discovery that could change conceptions of crime... and punishment.
Yes, all very interesting, I'm sure. But it doesn't solve the problem, which is still one of morality.
The girl brutally murdered a woman, possibly more, and she is unpunished.
Is that all you can think of?
I'm about to find out why she has to kill and all you can think of is revenge.
I can cure her.
The only cure for her trouble is a length of good, stout rope about her neck.
It was always the answer.
I must have been mad to listen to you.
Fear has made me neglect my duty.
And I think, Pritchard, any revised testimony you give about seeing me that night will be a waste of your breath, once it's out you're harbouring a murderer.
As a public servant, I intend to expose this menace.
Good day to you, sir.
I failed.
I failed you and I failed myself.
Forgive me, Anna.
The alterations to the dress will take hours.
- I can't possibly go with you.
- We'll go alone.
Go alone?
You can't be seen out together, two days before your wedding, unchaperoned.
Ah, there's your solution.
- Where are you off to?
- Anna, you're just in time to save not only our reputation in society but honour, as well.
Don't get too tired, Miss Laura.
- See she doesn't, Mr Michael.
- She'll be all right.
Dr Pritchard, is that you?
Yes, Mrs Bryant.
Is Michael with you?
He and Miss Laura have gone to his office in the city, Doctor, but it's all right, sir.
Anna's with them as chaperone. I wouldn't let them go alone.
I'll just go off and get your tea ready, Doctor.
Take the stairs on the left for the Whispering Gallery, madam.
Do you know there are 258 steps up here?
My father used to bring me when I was a little girl. I used to so look forward to it.
He'd sit on one side, 100 feet away, and I'd sit on the other side.
He'd whisper a line of poetry, and I'd whisper the next if I knew it.
That way, I learnt to speak poetry before I could even read.
Anna, give me your hand.
I'm longing for you to see this. It's really beautiful.
We shall be just under the dome when we reach the top.
We're here, sir.
- You all right, sir?
- Get Mr Michael, quickly.
Right away, sir.
- Anna, Laura, where are they?
- St Paul's.
- Get in. We must get there quickly.
- What's the matter?
- St Paul's, quickly.
Oh, I'm exhausted after all those stairs.
Anna, why don't you go over to the rail?
I knew you'd like it.
Now, go over to the other side, and sit down and listen to what I'm going to whisper to you.
Are you there yet, Anna?
Are you there yet, Anna?
Are you there yet?
Dr John, help me.
In her trance... any kiss would bring back the horror... of the last image... of her father.
Then... he would possess her.
He would make her kill.
I was wrong.
I made a terrible mistake.
We must get to Laura before anything happens.
Anna, what are you saying?
Anna, what are you saying?
I can't hear you. 'We finished him off, my dear.'
Dr John?
'He's dead and gone, 'along with all the others.'
Anna, is there someone with you?
Anna, is there someone with you?
Help me!
'The dead can't help, Anna.
'Neither can the living.'
Help me!
Anna, what's the matter?
'The dead can't help, Anna.'
It's perfectly safe.
You stay there. I'm coming round to you.
Don't be frightened.
Have two young ladies just gone up?
A little while back, yes, sir.
- Go ahead.
I can't make it. - We're about to close.
I'm coming, Anna.
Anna, where are you?
They were not all dreams.
Not all dreams.
'What are dreams, and what's real, Anna?
'I've never known.
- 'What does it matter?
' - They were not all dreams!
Oh, Dr John, help me!
Anna, dear, whatever is the matter?
You're trembling like a leaf.
Don't be frightened.
Just don't look down.
Hold on to me, and I'll lead you back.
'Whose darkness do we meet in, Laura?
'Your darkness or mine?
Anna, come to me!
Anna... come to me.
It's all right.
I suppose you think that's very funny, Harold.
- Hello?
Fée?
- Yeah.
Darling, be a dear and cancel my appointment with René this afternoon.
I know he'll be furious but I've had such a fright today and with guests coming this evening...
Tell him I promise to be in on Tuesday.
Thank you, Fée, you're a darling.
Yes.
Bye. Bye.
Dinner at eight, Harold.
And do try and be a little more vivacious.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd.
I remember once in Paris, he just stepped out for cigarettes and the next thing I knew he was arrested for floating nude down the Seine!
Experimenting in river currents with rubber water wings!
Mauve ones.
That cost quite a bit of influence et d'argent to hush up, I can tell you!
Harold, dear, don't play with your food.
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?
I have a sore throat.
Now, directly after dinner, I want you to go straight to bed.
Harold's always been a delicate child.
Even as a baby, he seemed prone to every possible kind of illness.
Harold, dear, eat up your beets.
I remember in Tokyo, I had to call the embassy for a doctor...
Oh, my God!
This is too much.
I can't stand much more of this.
I can't take any more.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminating.
There seems to be a definite pattern emerging and of course this pattern, once isolated, can be coped with.
Recognise the problem and you're halfway on the road to its... its solution.
Tell me, Harold, what do you do for fun?
What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment from the others?
What do you find fulfilling?
What gives you that special...
satisfaction?
I go to funerals.
"Thou dost prepare for me a table in the sight of my adversaries,
"Thou dost anoint my head with oil,
"my chalice overflows.
"Kindness and grace shall follow me all the days of my life
"and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days.
"The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,
"the world and they who dwell therein.
"For He has established it upon the waters and set it upon the rivers.
"Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord
"or who shall stand in His holy place?
"The innocent of hand and the pure of heart
"who has not turned his mind to vanity
"nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour,
"he shall receive the blessing from the Lord
"and a reward from God, his Saviour.
"This is the generation of those who seek him..."
Harold?
Why you purchased that monstrosity I have no idea.
You can have any car you want but that ugly horror is an eyesore and an embarrassment.
Really, it is time you settled down and stopped flitting away your talents on these amateur theatrics, these little divertissements, no matter how psychologically purging they may be.
I don't know what to do.
Go and have a talk with your Uncle Victor.
Perhaps he can fathom you.
After all, he was General MacArthur's right-hand man.
What do you say, Harold?
It's a great life.
There's action, adventure, advising and you'll see the war first hand.
And there are plenty of slant-eyed girls.
It'll make a man out of you, Harold.
You'll travel the world, put on a uniform and take on a man's job.
You'll walk tall with a glint in your eye and a spring in your step and a knowledge in your heart that you are working for peace
and are serving your country, just like Nathan Hale.
That's what this country needs, more Nathan Hale.
I think I can see a little Nathan Hale... in you.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these... suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Well, just give me a rough estimate.
A rough estimate?
I'd say... 15.
- 15?
- That's a rough estimate.
Were they all done for your mother's benefit?
No, no - I would not say benefit.
Harold, I only have a few minutes and I want to inform you of my decision.
You have led a very carefree, idle, happy life up to the present, the life of a child.
But it is time now to put away childish things and take on adult responsibilities.
We'd all like to sail through life with no thought of tomorrow but that cannot be.
We have our duties, our obligations, our principles.
In short, Harold, I think it is time for you to get married.
Let's pray to the Lord, King of Glory, that he may bless and deliver the souls of all faithful departed from the pain of hell and the bottomless pit.
Deliver them from the lion's mouth and the darkness therein and rather, bring them to the blessing of light, holy life, eternal rest.
"Oh, Lord, do not bring yourself into trial
"for no man...
"becomes holy in your sight unless you grant forgiveness of his sins.
"I implore you, therefore,
"do not let the verdict of your judgement go against him...
"Rather, by the help of your Grace,
"may he escape the sentence which he deserves
"for during his earthly life he would sign the seal of the Holy Trinity.
"You, who live and reign forever and ever.
"Amen."
- Like some liquorice?
- No, thank you.
You're welcome.
Did you know him?
- No.
- Me neither.
I heard he's 80 years old.
I'll be 80 next week.
A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
I mean, 75 is too early but at 85, you're just marking time.
You may as well look over the horizon.
