Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.
It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while, I could not enter, for the way was barred to me.
Then, like all dreamers, I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me.
The drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had always done.
But as I advanced, I was aware that a change had come upon it.
Nature had come into her own again, and little by little had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.
On and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive, and finally, there was Manderley.
Manderley, secretive and silent.
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls.
Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy, and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows.
And then a cloud came upon the moon and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face.
The illusion went with it.
I looked upon a desolate shell with no whisper of the past about its staring walls.
We can never go back to Manderley again.
That much is certain.
But sometimes in my dreams, I do go back to the strange days of my life which began for me in the South of France.
No! Stop!
What the devil are you shouting about?
Who are you?
What are you staring at?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare, but I... I only thought...
Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?
I was only walking.
Well, get on with your walking. Don't hang about here screaming.
I'll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again.
Not a single well-known personality in the hotel.
Stone cold.
Waiter!
Garcon! Call him. Tell him to get me some...
Why, it's Max de Winter.
How do you do?
I'm Edythe Van Hopper.
It's so nice to run into you here, just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte.
But do sit down and have some coffee.
Mr. De Winter is having some coffee with me. Go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup.
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me. Garcon.
Coffee, please.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
You know, I recognized you as soon as you came in, though I haven't seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
Perhaps you don't remember an old woman like me.
Are you playing the tables much here at Monte?
I'm afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago.
I can well understand that.
As for me, if I had a home like Manderley, I should certainly never come to Monte.
I hear it's one of the biggest places in that part of the country, and you just can't beat it for beauty.
What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?
Well, I think it's rather artificial.
She's spoiled, Mr. De Winter, that's her trouble.
Most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte.
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?
Now that we've found each other again, I hope I shall see something of you.
You must come and have a drink in my suite.
I hope they've given you a good room.
The place is empty, so if you're uncomfortable, mind you make a fuss.
Your valet has unpacked for you, I suppose?
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you would like to do it for me?
Well, I...
I hardly think...
Perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. De Winter if he wants anything done.
You're a capable child in many ways.
That's a charming suggestion, but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto,
"He travels fastest who travels alone. " Perhaps you've not heard it.
Good night.
What do you make of that?
Do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny?
Come, don't sit there gawking, let's go upstairs.
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I remember, when I was younger, there was a well-known writer who used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming.
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn't quite sure of himself.
Well, c'est la vie.
By the way, my dear, don't think that I mean to be unkind, but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. De Winter.
Your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me, and I'm sure it did him.
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come, don't sulk.
After all, I am responsible for your behavior here. Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing, I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
They say he simply adored her.
How awkward of me.
What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Please don't bother. It doesn't really matter.
No, leave that, leave that. Go and lay another place at my table. - Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly. - Why not?
- Oh, well, please don't be polite.
I... It's very kind of you but I'll be all right if they just change the cloth.
I wasn't being polite.
I should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.
Come along.
We needn't talk to each other if we don't feel like it.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, I... I'll just have some scrambled eggs. Oui, mademoiselle.
- What's happened to your friend?
- She's ill in bed with a cold.
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.
The only excuse I can offer is that I've become boorish through living alone.
You weren't really. You simply wanted to be alone and...
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation?
No, she's my employer. I'm what is known as "a paid companion. "
I didn't know companionship could be bought.
I looked at the word "companion" in the dictionary once.
It said, "a friend of the bosom. "
I don't envy you the privilege.
Well, she's very kind, really, and I have to earn my living.
Haven't you any family? No.
My mother died years and years ago, and there was only my father, and he died last summer.
And then I took this job.
How rotten for you.
Yes, it was rather, because, you see, we got on so well together.
You and your father? Yes.
He was a lovely person, very unusual.
- What was he? - A painter.
Ah!
Was he a good one?
Well, I thought so, but people didn't understand him.
Yes, that's often the trouble.
He painted trees.
At least, it was one tree.
You mean, he painted the same tree over and over again? Yes.
You see, he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing or place or person, you should stick to it. Do you think that's really silly?
Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.
And what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree?
Well, I sat with him and I sketched a little.
I don't do it very well, though.
Were you going sketching this afternoon? Yes.
- Well, I haven't made up my mind.
I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
Oh, no, please, I didn't mean...
Oh, nonsense. Finish up that mess, and we'll get along. Thank you.
It's very kind of you, but I'm not very hungry.
Come on. Eat it up like a good girl.
You've taken long enough for that sketch. I shall expect a really fine work of art.
Oh, no, don't look at it. It's not nearly good enough.
Well, it can't be as bad as all that. Now don't rub it all out.
Let me see it first.
Well, it's the perspective. I never can get it right. Let me see it, let me see it.
Oh, dear. Tell me, is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious twist in the middle?
Well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch. Your...
Your expression keeps changing all the time. Does it?
Well, I'd...
I'd concentrate on the view instead, if I were you.
Much more worthwhile.
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home.
Do you know Cornwall at all?
Yes, I went there once with my father on holiday.
I was in a shop once, and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it, right by the sea.
I asked whose house it was, and the old lady said, "That's Manderley. "
I felt ashamed for not knowing.
Manderley is beautiful.
But to me, it's just the place where I was born, and have lived in all my life.
But now, I don't suppose I shall ever see it again.
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather, aren't we?
I can't ever remember enjoying swimming in England till June, can you?
The water's so warm here that I could stay in all day.
There's a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year.
I never have any fear of drowning. Have you?
Come, I'll take you home.
Oh, yes, I know Mr. De Winter well.
I knew his wife, too.
Before she married, she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
She was drowned, poor dear, while she was sailing near Manderley.
He never talks about it, of course, but he's a broken man.
I suppose I'd better have it.
Wretched stuff! Give me a chocolate, quick!
Oh, there you are. It's about time.
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
They say he simply adored her.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
I suppose he just can't get over his wife's death.
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
But he's a broken man.
- Well, where are you going?
- I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.
I see. I suppose you've had a look at the pro, and he's desperately handsome, and you've conceived a schoolgirl crush on him.
All right.
Go ahead. Make the most of it.
Off duty? Well, yes.
Mrs. Van Hopper's cold's turned into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.
I'm sorry for the nurse. You keen on tennis?
- Well, not particularly.
- That's good. We'll go for a drive.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper. How are you feeling?
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?
That pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis.
Hurry up, I want you to make some calls.
I wonder if Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel.
May I go now?
For the number of lessons you've had, you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.
But this will be your last, so make the most of it.
The trouble is, with me laid up like this, you haven't had enough to do.
I'm getting rid of that nurse today. And from now on, you'll stick to your job.
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
- Nurse? - Yes, Mrs. Hopper?
Are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr. De Winter?
- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.
He would most certainly have called me back. Oh, well.
Poor boy, I simply hate to see him so alone.
You know, I... I wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory, like perfume, and it never faded, never got stale.
Then whenever I wanted to, I could uncork the bottle and live the memory all over again.
And what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep?
All of them. All these last few days.
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected a whole shelf full of bottles.
Sometimes, you know, those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you, just as you're trying most desperately to forget.
Stop biting your nails.
I wish I were a woman of 36, dressed in black satin with a string of pearls.
You wouldn't be here with me if you were.
Would you please tell me, Mr. De Winter, why you asked me to come out with you?
It's obvious you want to be kind, but why do you choose me for your charity?
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company.
You've blotted out the past for me more than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.
But if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity, you can leave the car now and find your own way home.
Go on. Open the door and get out.
- Better blow your nose. - Thank you.
Please don't call me Mr. De Winter.
I have a very impressive array of first names.
George Fortescue Maximilian.
You needn't bother with them all at once.
My family call me Maxim.
And another thing, please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls, or to be 36 years old.
Yes, Maxim.
For the love of Pete!
Come here!
What do you think? My daughter's engaged to be married.
Oh, really? How nice!
We must leave for New York at once.
Get reservations on the Aquitania, and we'll take the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.
Hurry up and get me the maid to help with the packing. We've no time to waste.
Go on and don't dawdle.
Mr. De Winter, please.
He's gone out riding?
He won't be back till noon?
Give me the porter, please.
I'll go and see if there's anything left in my room.
Has Mr. De Winter come in yet?
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?
I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.
Well, come on, the car's waiting at the door.
I'd like to leave a forwarding address, if they happen to find that book.
- Would you ring Mr. De Winter, please? - Yes, madame.
- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you.
- Tell her to hurry up! - Yes, madame.
I was looking for Mr. De Winter.
Mr. De Winter just ordered breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.
Come in.
What are you doing here?
Anything the matter?
I've come to say goodbye. We're going away.
What on Earth are you talking about?
It's true.
We're going now, and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again.
- Where's she taking you to?
- New York.
I don't want to go. I shall hate it.
I shall be miserable.
I'll dress in here.
I shan't be long.
Which would you prefer, New York or Manderley?
Oh, please don't joke about it.
Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting. I'd better say goodbye now.
I'll repeat what I said.
Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper, or you come home to Manderley with me.
You mean you want a secretary or something?
I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.
Come in.
Is that my food? I'm famished.
I didn't have any breakfast.
My suggestion didn't seem to go at all well. Sorry.
Oh, but you don't understand. It's the...
- I'm not the sort of person men marry.
- What on Earth do you mean?
I don't belong in your sort of world, for one thing.
Well, what is my sort of world?
Well, Manderley.
You know what I mean.
Well, I'm the best judge of whether you belong there or not.
Of course, if you don't love me, that's a different thing.
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.
I do love you. I love you most dreadfully.
I've been crying all morning because I thought I'd never see you again.
Bless you for that.
I'll remind you of this one day and you won't believe me.
It's a pity you have to grow up.
Well, now that's settled.
You may pour me out some coffee.
Two lumps of sugar and some milk, please.
Same with my tea, don't forget.
Who is going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper? Shall you or should I?
You tell her.
She'll be so angry.
What's the number of her room?
She's not there. She's downstairs in the car.
Hello.
Give me the desk, please.
Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper waiting outside in her car.
Would you ask her, with my compliments, if she'd very kindly come up and see me in my room?
Yes, in my room.
Mr. De Winter says please for you to come up to his room. Mr. De Winter?
Why, certainly.
This isn't at all your idea of a proposal, is it?
It should be in a conservatory, you in a white frock, with a red rose in your hand, and a violin playing in the distance, and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree.
Poor darling.
Never mind.
I don't mind.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.
I'm so glad you called me, Mr. De Winter.
I was making a hasty departure. It was so rude of me not to let you know.
But a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married.
That's rather a coincidence, Mrs. Van Hopper.
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement.
You don't mean it.
How perfectly wonderful.
How romantic.
Who is the lucky lady?
I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way.
I do hope it won't inconvenience you too greatly.
When did all this happen?
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.
I simply can't believe it.
And I suppose I ought to scold you for not having breathed a word of all of this to me.
What am I thinking of? I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings.
I'm very happy for you both.
- When and where is the wedding to be?
- Here, as soon as possible.
A whirlwind romance.
Splendid!
I can easily postpone my sailing for a week.
This poor child has no mother, so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements.
Trousseau, reception and everything, and I'll give the bride away.
But our luggage.
Go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car.
Just a minute.
We're most grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper, but I think we'd both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible.
And I couldn't possibly allow you to change your sailing plans.
- Oh, but... - No, no, no.
Dear, I'll go down and see that your luggage is brought back.
Thank you, Maxim.
So this is what's been happening during my illness.
Tennis lessons, my foot.
I suppose I've to hand it to you for a fast worker.
How did you manage it?
Still waters certainly run deep.
Tell me, have you been doing anything you shouldn't?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, never mind.
I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes.
You certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley.
To be perfectly frank with you, my dear, I can't see you doing it.
You haven't the experience, you haven't the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady.
Of course you know why he's marrying you, don't you?
You haven't flattered yourself that he's in love with you?
Fact is, that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent, he nearly went off his head.
He just couldn't go on living alone.
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.
Mrs. De Winter.
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck!
What is he saying?
He says I've forgotten the proof that we're married.
Good heavens.
Somebody else had the same idea.
- Isn't she sweet? - Yes.
You'd have liked a bridal veil, wouldn't you?
Or at least...
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.
How perfectly lovely.
Welcome home, Mr. De Winter.
Thank you, Smith.
- Cold, darling? - Yes, just a little bit.
There's no need to be frightened, you know.
Just be yourself, and they'll all adore you.
You don't have to worry about the house at all.
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper. Just leave it to her.
Hello. It's starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.
Here. Have this. Put it over your head.
Thank you.
That's it. That's Manderley.
- Here we are. Frith, everybody well? - Yes, thank you, sir.
Glad to see you home, sir.
- This is Mrs. De Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?
I didn't expect the whole staff to be in attendance.
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.
Sorry about this. It won't take long.
This is Mrs. Danvers.
How do you do?
I have everything in readiness for you.
That's very good of you. I...
I didn't expect anything.
- I think we'd like some tea, Frith.
- Ready in the library, sir.
Come along, darling.
Oh, Maxim, come in.
Oh.
- Good evening, Mrs. Danvers.
- I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.
- Oh, yes, thank you, perfectly.
She's the parlor maid. She'll have to look after you until your own maid arrives.
Oh, but I haven't a maid.
I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.
I'm afraid that would not do for very long, madam. It's usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid.
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms, madam?
Oh, I didn't know it had been changed.
I hope you haven't been to too much trouble.
I only followed out Mr. De Winter's instructions.
Well, what did it look like before?
It had an old paper and different hangings.
It was never used much except for occasional visitors.
Oh. Then it wasn't Mr. De Winter's room originally?
No, madam.
He's never used the east wing before.
Of course, there's no view of the sea from here.
The only good view of the sea is from the west wing.
The room's very charming, and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.
If there's anything you want done, madam, you have only to tell me.
I suppose you've been at Manderley for many years, longer than anyone else.
Not so long as Frith.
He was here when the old gentleman was living, when Mr. De Winter was a boy.
Oh, I see. And you didn't come till after that?
I came here when the first Mrs. De Winter was a bride.
Mrs. Danvers, I do hope we'll be friends.
You must be patient with me.
This sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it, and make Mr. De Winter happy, so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you.
Very well.
I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction, madam.
I've managed the house since Mrs. De Winter's death and Mr. De Winter has never complained.
I think I'll go downstairs now.
That room in the west wing I was telling you about is there, through that door.
It's not used now.
It's the most beautiful room in the house, the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea.
It was Mrs. De Winter's room.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
- You're Mrs. De Winter, aren't you? - Yes.
My name's Crawley.
I manage the estate for Maxim.
Awfully glad to meet you.
A fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away.
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.
I do wish I could help with some of it.
No, no!
Frank never allows anybody to help him.
He's like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes.
Come on, Frank, we must go over these estimates.
I'll get my papers.
You'll find quantities of breakfast over there. But you must eat it all, or Cook will be mortally offended.
I'll do my best, Maxim.
I have to go over the place with Frank, just to make sure that he hasn't lost any of it.
You'll be all right, won't you?
Getting acquainted with your new home?
Have a look at The Times. There's a thrilling article on what's the matter with English cricket.
Oh, yes...
My sister, Beatrice, and her husband, Giles Lacy, have invited themselves over for lunch.
- Today? - Yes.
I suppose the old girl can't wait to look you over.
You'll find her very direct.
If she doesn't like you, she'll probably tell you so to your face.
Don't worry, darling, I'll be back in time to protect you from her.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Maxim.
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.
Isn't there anything I could get for you, madam?
No, thank you, Frith. I'm really not very hungry.
- The paper, madam. - Oh, yes.
Thank you, Frith.
I slipped.
Thank you, Frith.
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam, Manderley is a big place.
This was the banquet hall in the old days.
It's still used on great occasions, such as a big dinner or a ball.
And the public is admitted here, you know, once a week.
That's nice.
I beg pardon, madam. I'm afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon.
But you'll find one in the morning room.
Of course, if you wish this fire lit now, madam...
No, Frith, I wouldn't dream of it.
Mrs. De Winter...
I mean, the late Mrs. De Winter always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room, after breakfast.
Thank you, Frith.
Is anything wrong, madam?
Oh, no. Which way is the morning room?
Oh, it's that door there, on the left. Oh, yes, thank you.
Mrs. De Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake. Mrs. De Winter's been dead for over a year.
Oh, I mean...
That was the house telephone, madam.
Probably the head gardener wishing instructions.
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?
Mr. De Winter informed me that his sister, Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon.
I'd like to know if you approve of the menu.
Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed.
You will notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce.
Mrs. De Winter was most particular about sauces.
Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered.
Thank you, madam.
When you've finished your letters, Robert will take them to the post.
My...
My letters?
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.
Where's Mr. De Winter?
I believe he went down to the farm with Mr. Crawley.
How tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive, and how typical.
I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely.
She's certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca.
I wonder how she likes it now, being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl.
Now, where on Earth did you get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?
He picked her up in the South of France, didn't he?
What if he did?
Well, I mean to say, there you are.
How do you do? I'm Maxim's wife. How do you do?
Well, I must say you're quite different from what I expected.
Don't be so silly. She's exactly what I told you she'd be.
Well, how do you like Manderley?
It's very beautiful, isn't it?
And how do you get along with Mrs. Danvers?
Well, I... I've never met anyone quite like her before.
You mean, she scares you.
She's not exactly an oil painting, is she?
Giles, you're very much in the way here.
Go somewhere else.
Well, I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?
Giles.
I didn't mean to say anything against Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, there's no need for you to be frightened of her, but I shouldn't have any more to do with her than you can help.
- Shall we sit down? - Yes.
Yes, please.
You see, she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly.
But why should she?
Don't you know?
I should have thought Maxim would have told you.
She simply adored Rebecca.
- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.
- Still having trouble with your teeth? - Unfortunately, yes, madam.
You must have them out, all of them.
- Wretched nuisances, teeth. - Thank you, madam.
What a plateful.
Do you hunt?
No, I don't. I'm afraid I don't even ride.
You have to ride down here, we all do.
Which do you ride, sidesaddle or astride?
Well, of course, I forgot. You don't, do you? You must.
Nothing else to do around here.
Maxim, when are you going to have parties here again, like the old days?
I haven't thought about it.
- But everyone's dying to see you and...
- Yes, I bet they are.
Why don't you have the masquerade ball again this summer?
My dear, are you fond of dancing?
I love it, but I'm not very good at it.
Do you rumba?
- Never tried.
- You must teach me.
Actually, I'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do.
She sketches a little.
Sketches.
Not this modern stuff, I hope, you know, portrait of a lampshade upside down to represent a soul in torment.
Don't sail, do you?
No, I don't.
Thank goodness for that.
You're very much in love with Maxim, aren't you?
Yes, I can see you are.
Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you do something about your hair?
Why don't you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears?
Oh, no, that's worse.
What does Maxim say about it? Does he like it like that?
Well, he never mentions it.
Oh, well, don't go by me.
I can see by the way you dress you don't care a hoot how you look.
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you.
He's so particular about clothes.
I don't think he ever notices what I wear. Oh.
He must have changed a lot, then.
You mustn't worry about old Maxim and his moods.
One never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his.
Often, he gets into a terrible rage, and when he does...
I don't suppose he'll lose his temper with you. You seem such a placid little thing.
Come on, old girl. We've got to go on the first tee at 3:00.
All right, I'm coming.
Well, goodbye, Maxim, old boy.
Goodbye, Giles. Thanks for coming, old boy.
Goodbye, my dear.
Forgive me for asking you so many rude questions.
We both really hope you'll be very happy.
Thank you, Beatrice, thank you very much.
And I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks.
We were very worried about him this time last year.
But then, of course, you know the whole story.
Goodbye, Beatrice. - Goodbye, old boy.
Well, thank heavens they've gone.
Now we can have a walk about the place.
Looks as though we might have a shower. But you won't mind that, will you?
No, but wait a minute. I'll go upstairs and get a coat.
There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room. Robert?
Run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs. De Winter, will you?
What do you think of Beatrice?
Oh, I liked her very much, but she kept saying that I was quite different from what she expected.
What the devil did she expect?
Oh, someone smarter and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.
Do you like my hair? Your hair?
Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?
Oh, I don't know.
I just wondered.
How funny you are.
Thank you.
- Do I have to put it on?
- Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly. You can't be too careful with children.
Come on, Jasper. Come and take some of that fat off.
Jasper! Here.
Not that way! Come here!
Where does that lead to?
Oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat.
Oh, let's go down there.
Well, no. It's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand, - just like any other.
- Oh, please. Well, all right.
We'll walk down and take a look if you really want to.
That's Jasper.
There must be something wrong.
- Perhaps he's hurt himself. - No, he's all right, leave him alone.
Don't you think I'd better go and see?
Don't bother about him, I tell you, he can't come to any harm. He'll find his own way back!
Jasper!
Oh, there you are.
What do you want in there, Jasper? Come on. Come on home.
Let's go home.
Jasper...
I didn't know that there was anybody...
I know that dog.
He comes from the house.
He ain't yours. No.
He's Mr. De Winter's dog.
Have you anything I could tie him with?
Come on, Jasper.
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there, will you?
Don't you belong on the estate?
I weren't doing nothing.
I was just putting me shells away.
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?
She'll never come back no more.
No. She'll never come back.
Come on, Jasper.
Maxim!
What's the matter?
Maxim!
I'm sorry I was such a time, but I had to find a rope for Jasper.
Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.
Please wait for me.
Maxim, what is it? You look so angry.
You knew I didn't want you to go there, but you deliberately went.
Why not? There was only a cottage down there and a strange man who...
- You didn't go in the cottage, did you? - Yes, the door was...
- Don't go there again, do you hear? - Well, why not?
Because I hate the place.
And if you had my memories, you wouldn't go there or talk about it or even think about it.
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry, please.
We should have stayed away. We should never have come back to Manderley.
Oh, what a fool I was.
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow, I've hurt you.
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this because I love you so much.
Do you?
I've made you cry.
Forgive me.
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all.
Don't I?
Come, we'll go home and have some tea and forget all about it.
Yes, let's forget all about it.
Here, let me have Jasper.
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day - about showing me the run of things.
- Of course I did.
What are you doing now?
Notifying all the tenants that in celebration of Maxim's return with his bride, this week's rent will be free.
Oh, is that Maxim's idea?
Oh, yes, all the servants get an extra week's wages, too.
Oh, he didn't tell me.
Can't I help you? I could at least lick the stamps.
Well, that's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?
Yes, thank you.
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day.
There was a man there, a queer sort of person.
Jasper kept barking at him.
Oh, yes, it must have been Ben. Excuse me.
He's quite harmless.
We give him odd jobs now and then.
That cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin.
Why isn't something done about it?
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it, he'd tell me.
Are those all Rebecca's things down there?
Yes.
Yes, they are.
What did she use the cottage for?
The boat used to be moored near there.
What boat?
What happened to it? Was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned?
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.
Wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone?
She wasn't afraid of anything.
Where did they find her?
Near Edgecombe, about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards.
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.
Yes, it must have been.
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me morbidly curious. It isn't that.
It's... It's just that I feel at such a disadvantage.
All the time, whenever I meet anyone, Maxim's sister or even the servants,
I know they're all thinking the same thing, that they're all comparing me with her, with Rebecca.
You mustn't think that.
I can't tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim.
It's going to make all the difference to his life.
From my point of view, it's very refreshing to find someone like yourself, who's not entirely in tune, shall we say, with Manderley.
That's very sweet of you.
I daresay I've been stupid, but every day I realize the things she had that I lack.
Beauty and wit and intelligence, and all the things that are so important in a woman.
You have qualities that are just as important, more important, if I may say so.
Kindliness and sincerity, and if you'll forgive me, modesty, mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world.
We, none of us want to live in the past, Maxim least of all.
It's up to you, you know, to lead us away from it.
Right.
I promise you I won't bring this up again, but before we end this conversation, would you answer just one more question?
If it's something I'm able to answer, I'll do my best.
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?
I suppose...
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw.
Good evening, Maxim.
Hello.
The films of the honeymoon have arrived at last.
Do we have time, do you think, before dinner?
What on Earth have you done to yourself?
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress from London. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no.
Only, do you think that sort of thing's right for you? - It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.
And what have you done to your hair?
Oh, I see.
Dear, oh, dear. I'm sorry.
You look lovely, lovely.
It's very nice, for a change.
- Shall we see these pictures? - Yes.
I'd love to see them.
Look now, look at that.
Wasn't it wonderful, darling?
Can't we go back there someday?
Yes, of course. Of course.
Look at you. Won't our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were?
Oh, look at you.
Oh, I like that. Look at that.
Yes, very nice.
- Remember that? Yes.
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever, Maxim.
Dash it, look.
Hang it. I've threaded it up wrong as usual or something.
Yes, Frith. What is it?
Excuse me, sir. May I have a word with you?
Yes. Come in.
It's about Robert, sir.
There's been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs. Danvers. Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.
- This is trouble. What is it?
It appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room.
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically, sir.
- What was the thing, anyway?
- China cupid, sir.
Oh, dear. That's one of our treasures, isn't it?
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow.
- Tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert. - Very good, sir.
Why do they come to me with these things? That's your job, sweetheart.
Maxim, I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.
The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
You broke it?
Now, why on Earth didn't you say something about it when Frith was here?
I don't know.
I didn't like to. I was afraid he'd think me a fool.
He'll think you much more of a fool now. You'll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers.
Oh, no, Maxim. You do it.
I'll go upstairs.
Don't be such a little idiot, darling. Anybody would think you were afraid of them.
It's all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers. Apparently, Mrs. De Winter broke the cupid herself and forgot to say anything about it.
I'm so sorry. I never thought that I'd get Robert into trouble.
Is it possible to repair the ornament, madam?
No, I'm afraid it isn't. It smashed into pieces.
What did you do with the pieces?
Well, I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk.
Well, it looks as though Mrs. De Winter was afraid you were going to put her in prison, doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?
Well, never mind. Do what you can to find the pieces. See if they can be mended, and above all, tell Robert to dry his tears.
I shall apologize to Robert, of course.
Perhaps if such a thing happens again, Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally.
Yes, yes, all right. Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.
Well, I suppose that clip will hold all right. I don't know.
I'm awfully sorry, darling.
It was very careless of me.
- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me.
- Hang Mrs. Danvers. Why on Earth should you be frightened of her?
You behave more like an upstairs maid or something, - not the mistress of the house at all.
- Yes, I know I do.
But I feel so uncomfortable.
I try my best every day, but it's very difficult with people looking me up and down as if I were a prize cow.
What does it matter if they do?
You must remember that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here.
What a slap in the eye I must have been to them, then.
I suppose that's why you married me, because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced, and there'd never be any gossip about me.
Gossip? What do you mean?
I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.
Don't look at me like that. Maxim.
What's the matter?
What have I said?
Wasn't a very attractive thing to say, was it? No.
It was rude, hateful.
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you.
How do you mean?
I'm not much of a companion to you, am I?
You don't get much fun, do you?
You ought to have married a boy, someone of your own age.
Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.
Are we?
I don't know.
- I'm very difficult to live with. - No, you're not difficult.
You're easy, very easy.
Our marriage is a success, isn't it, a great success?
We're happy, aren't we? Terribly happy?
If you don't think we are happy, it would be much better if you didn't pretend.
I'll go away.
Why don't you answer me?
How can I answer you when I don't know the answer myself?
If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that.
Happiness is something I know nothing about.
Oh, look. There's the one when I left the camera running on the tripod, remember?
Pardon me, madam. Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm all right, Hilda. Thank you very much.
I'll bring the sandwiches immediately, madam.
- Hilda.
- Yes, madam?
The west wing. Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they? No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. De Winter.
Come along, Mr. Jack, or someone may see you.
Well, Danny, old harpy, it's been good to see you again.
I've been simply breathless to pick up all the news.
I really don't think it's wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.
Jasper, come here.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense. It's just like coming back home.
Quiet, Mr. Jack.
We must be careful not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?
She's in the morning room.
If you leave through the garden door, she won't see you.
I must say, I feel a little like the poor relation, sneaking around through back doors.
Well, toodle-oo, Danny.
Goodbye, Mr. Jack, and please be careful.
Jasper, be quiet.
Looking for me?
- I didn't make you jump, did I?
- No. Of course not. I didn't quite know who it was.
You're pleased to see me, aren't you, old boy?
I'm glad there's someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley.
And how is dear old Max?
Very well, thank you.
I hear he went up to London, left his little bride all alone.
It's too bad.
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off?
Danny, all your precautions were in vain.
The mistress of the house was hiding behind the door.
Oh. What about presenting me to the bride?
This is Mr. Favell, madam.
How do you do?
- Won't you have some tea or something?
- Now, isn't that a charming invitation?
I've been asked to tea, Danny, and I've a good mind to accept.
Oh, well, perhaps you're right.
Pity, just when we were getting on so nicely.
We mustn't lead the young bride astray, must we, Jasper?
Goodbye.
It's been fun meeting you.
Oh, and by the way, it would be very decent of you if you didn't mention this little visit to your revered husband.
He doesn't exactly approve of me.
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home.
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.
Fare thee well.
Oh, and I know what was wrong with that introduction. Danny didn't tell you, did she?
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.
Toodle-oo!
Do you wish anything, madam?
I didn't expect to see you, Mrs. Danvers.
I noticed that a window wasn't closed and I came up to see - if I could fasten it.
- Why did you say that? I closed it before I left the room.
You opened it yourself, didn't you?
You've always wanted to see this room, haven't you, madam?
Why did you never ask me to show it to you?
I was ready to show it to you every day.
It's a lovely room, isn't it?
Loveliest room you've ever seen.
Everything is kept just as Mrs. De Winter liked it. Nothing has been altered since that last night.
Come. I'll show you her dressing room.
This is where I keep all her clothes.
You would like to see them, wouldn't you?
Feel this.
It was a Christmas present from Mr. De Winter.
He was always giving her expensive gifts, the whole year round.
I keep her underwear on this side.
They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.
I always used to wait up for her, no matter how late.
Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter didn't come home until dawn.
While she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.
She knew everyone that mattered. Everyone loved her.
When she finished her bath, she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.
Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you? There. That's better.
Just as she always laid it down.
"Come on, Danny. Hair drill, " she would say.
And I'd stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.
And then she would say, "Good night, Danny, "
and step into her bed.
I embroidered this case for her myself, and I keep it here always.
Did you ever see anything so delicate?
Look. You can see my hand through it.
You wouldn't think she'd been gone so long, would you?
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor, I fancy I hear her just behind me.
That quick light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.
Not only in this room, it's in all the rooms in the house.
I can almost hear it now.
Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?
No, I don't believe it.
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't come back here to Manderley, and watch you and Mr. De Winter together.
You look tired.
Why don't you stay here a while and rest?
And listen to the sea.
So soothing.
Listen to it.
Listen.
Listen to the sea.
Tell Mrs. Danvers I wish to see her immediately.
You sent for me, madam?
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.
I want you to get rid of all these things.
- These are Mrs. De Winter's things.
- I am Mrs. De Winter now.
Very well. I'll give the instructions.
Just a moment, please.
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to Mr. De Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.
In fact, I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon.
Maxim, Maxim, you've been gone all day.
You're choking me.
Well, well, well, what have you been doing with yourself? - I've been thinking.
- What did you want to do that for?
Come in here and I'll tell you.
Darling, could we have a costume ball just as you used to?
Now what put that into your mind?
Has Beatrice been at you?
No, no, but I feel that we ought to do something to make people feel that Manderley is just the same as it always was.
Oh, please, darling, could we?
You don't know what it would mean, you know.
You'd have to be hostess to hundreds of people, all the county.
And a lot of young people would come up from London, - and turn the house into a nightclub.
- Oh, yes. But I want to. Please.
I've never been to a large party, but I could learn what to do. And I promise you, you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers to help you out, won't you?
No, no. I don't need Mrs. Danvers to help me.
I can do it myself.
All right, my sweet.
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
- What'll you go as? - I never dress up.
That's the one privilege I claim as the host.
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland, with that ribbon around your hair?
No, I won't tell you.
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life.
Come in.
Robert found these sketches in the library, madam.
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did. They were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball.
Hasn't Mr. De Winter suggested anything?
No, I want to surprise him.
I don't want him to know anything about it.
I merely thought that you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you.
Oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs?
I'll go and look at them.
This one, for instance.
Might have been designed for you.
I'm sure you could have it copied.
I've heard Mr. De Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings.
It's Lady Caroline de Winter, one of his ancestors.
Oh, well, that's a splendid idea, Mrs. Danvers.
I'm very grateful.
- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir, thank you.
Excuse me, sir, are you supposed to be a schoolmaster? Oh, no.
This is just my old cap and gown.
It certainly makes a very nice costume, sir.
And economical, too.
Yes. That was the idea.
Good evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball. - No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.
Oh, this wig's so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it.
Hello. What's the idea?
Adam and Eve?
Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.
- Strongman. Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?
You haven't left it in the car, have you?
There it is.
- You were the first one down? - Yes. Where's the child?
Well, she's keeping her costume a terrific secret. Wouldn't even let me into her room.
Oh, lovely.
I'll go up and give her a hand.
- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch a cold in that thing? Don't be silly.
Pure wool, old boy.
- Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.
Here I am, dear, it's Bea. I've come to give you a hand.
Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice. I don't want anyone to see my costume. Oh.
Oh, you won't be long, will you?
Because the first people will be arriving any moment.
Now, you're sure that's where that should be? Yes, madam, it's just right.
- Isn't it exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.
I've always heard of the Manderley ball, and now I'm really going to see one.
I'm sure there will be no one there to touch you, madam.
Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan? Here.
- You're sure I look all right?
- You look ever so beautiful.
Well, here goes.
Good evening, Mr. De Winter.
What the devil do you think you're doing?
Rebecca.
But it's the picture. The one in the gallery.
- What is it? What have I done?
- Go and take it off.
It doesn't matter what you put on. Anything will do.
What are you standing there for? Didn't you hear what I said?
Sir George and Lady Moore.
Dudley Tennant.
Admiral and Lady Burbank.
I watched you go down, just as I watched her a year ago.
Even in the same dress, you couldn't compare.
You knew it. You knew that she wore it, and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.
Why do you hate me? What have I done to you that you should ever hate me so?
You tried to take her place, you let him marry you.
I've seen his face, his eyes. They're the same as those first weeks after she died.
I used to listen to him walking up and down, up and down, all night long, night after night, thinking of her, suffering torture because he'd lost her.
I don't want to know. I don't want to know!
You thought you could be Mrs. De Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers.
But she's too strong for you. You can't fight her.
No one ever got the better of her. Never. Never.
She was beaten in the end, but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman. It was the sea.
Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh, stop it.
You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.
A little air will do you good.
Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?
He doesn't need you.
He's got his memories.
He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.
You've nothing to stay for.
You've nothing to live for, really, have you?
Look down there.
It's easy, isn't it?
Why don't you?
Why don't you?
Go on.
Don't be afraid.
Shipwreck. Ship on the rocks!
- A ship aground, sending up rockets!
Notify the coast guard. She's aground.
Maxim! Maxim!
Ship ashore. Come on!
Come on, everybody.
Come on! - Maxim! Maxim!
Ben, have you seen Mr. De Winter anywhere?
She won't come back, will she?
You said so. Who, Ben?
What do you mean?
The other one.
- Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?
- Not since about half an hour ago.
I thought he'd gone up to the house.
No, he hasn't been in the house at all, and I'm afraid something might have happened to him.
Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
- There is something wrong. - Well...
The diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the ship came across the hull of another boat. A little sailboat.
- Frank, is it...
- Yes. It's Rebecca's.
How did they recognize it?
He's a local man. Knew it instantly.
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.
Yes. It's going to bring it all back again, and worse than before.
Why did they have to find it?
Why couldn't they have left it there in peace at the bottom of the sea?
Well, I'd better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men.
All right, Frank. I'll go and look for Maxim.
- Hello.
- Maxim.
You haven't had any sleep.
- Have you forgiven me? - Forgiven you?
What have I got to forgive you for?
For last night. My stupidity about the costume.
Oh, that.
I'd forgotten.
I was angry with you, wasn't I?
Maxim, can't we start all over again?
I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.
I'll be your friend, your companion.
I'll be happy with that.
You love me very much, don't you?
But it's too late, my darling.
We've lost our little chance of happiness.
- No, Maxim, no.
- Yes.
It's all over now.
The thing's happened.
The thing I have dreaded day after day.
- Night after night.
- Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?
Rebecca has won.
Her shadow has been between us all the time, keeping us from one another.
She knew that this would happen.
What are you saying?
They sent a diver down.
- He found another boat.
- Yes, I know. Frank told me. Rebecca's boat.
Oh, it's terrible for you.
The diver made another discovery.
Broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin.
There was a body in there.
She wasn't alone.
There was someone sailing with her, and you have to find out who it was, that's it, isn't it, Maxim?
You don't understand.
There was no one with her.
It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin floor.
Oh, no.
The woman that was washed up at Edgecombe, the woman that is now buried in the family crypt, that was not Rebecca.
That was the body of some unknown woman, unclaimed, belonging nowhere.
I identified it. But I knew it wasn't Rebecca.
It was all a lie.
I knew where Rebecca's body was, lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea.
How did you know, Maxim?
Because I put it there.
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now?
You see? I was right.
It's too late.
No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.
I love you more than anything in the world.
- Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please. - No.
It's no use.
It's too late.
Oh, we can't lose each other now.
We must be together always. No secrets, no shadows.
We may only have a few days, a few hours.
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?
I nearly did sometimes, but you never seemed close enough.
How could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca?
How could I even ask you to love me, when I knew you loved Rebecca still?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Whenever you touched me, I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca.
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden,
I knew you were thinking, "This I did with Rebecca, and this, and this. "
Oh, it's true, isn't it?
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?
I hated her.
Oh, I was carried away by her, enchanted by her as everyone was.
And when I was married, I was told I was the luckiest man in the world.
She was so lovely, so accomplished, so amusing.
"She's got the three things that really matter in a wife, " everyone said.
"Breeding, brains and beauty. "
And I believed them. Completely.
But I never had a moment's happiness with her.
She was incapable of love or tenderness or decency.
You didn't love her. You didn't love her.
Do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?
Well, I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon.
That's where I found out about her, four days after we were married.
She stood there laughing, her black hair blowing in the wind and told me all about herself.
Everything.
Things I'll never tell a living soul.
I wanted to kill her.
It would have been so easy.
You remember the precipice?
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.
Perhaps I was.
Perhaps I am mad.
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it? Living with the devil?
"I'll make a bargain with you, " she said.
"You'd look rather foolish trying to divorce me now after four days of marriage, so I'll play the part of a devoted wife, mistress of your precious Manderley.
I'll make it the most famous showplace in England, if you like, and people will visit us and envy us, and say we're the luckiest, happiest couple in the country.
What a grand joke it'll be.
What a triumph. "
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain, but I did.
I was younger then, and tremendously conscious of the family honor.
Family honor.
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court and give her away, admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud.
You despise me, don't you?
As I despise myself.
You can't understand what my feelings were, can you?
Of course I can, darling. Of course I can.
Well, I kept the bargain and so did she, apparently.
Oh, she played the game brilliantly, but after a while, she began to grow careless.
She took a flat in London, and she'd stay away for days at a time.
Then she started to bring her friends down here.
I warned her, but she shrugged her shoulders. "What's it got to do with you?" She said.
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.
Then there was a cousin of hers, a man named Favell.
Yes. I know him.
He came the day you went to London.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't like to.
I thought it would remind you of Rebecca.
Remind me?
As if I needed reminding.
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage.
I found out about it, and I warned her that if he came here again, I'd shoot them both.
One night, when I found she had come back quietly from London,
I thought that Favell was with her, and I knew then that I couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer.
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them.
But she was alone.
She was expecting Favell, but he hadn't come.
She was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.
She looked ill, queer.
Suddenly, she got up, started to walk toward me.
"When I have a child, " she said, "neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn't yours.
You would like to have an heir, wouldn't you, Max, for your precious Manderley?"
Then she started to laugh.
"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.
I'll be the perfect mother, just as I've been the perfect wife.
No one will ever know.
It ought to give you the thrill of your life, Max, to watch my son grow bigger day by day and to know that when you die, Manderley will be his. "
She was face to face with me.
One hand in her pocket, the other holding a cigarette.
She was smiling.
"Well, Max? What are you going to do about it?
Aren't you going to kill me?"
I suppose I went mad for a moment.
I must have struck her.
She stood staring at me.
She looked almost triumphant.
Then she started toward me again. Smiling.
Suddenly, she stumbled and fell.
When I looked down, ages afterwards, it seemed, she was lying on the floor. She had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.
I remember wondering why she was still smiling.
Then I realized she was dead.
But you didn't kill her. It was an accident.
Who would believe me?
I lost my head.
I just knew I had to do something. Anything.
I carried her out to the boat.
It was very dark. There was no moon.
I put her in the cabin.
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore, I took a spike, and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull.
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast.
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away.
I saw the boat heel over and sink.
I pulled back into the cove.
It started raining.
- Maxim, does anyone else know of this? - No.
No one except you and me.
We must explain it.
It's got to be the body of someone you've never seen before.
No, they're bound to know her. Her rings, bracelets she always wore.
They'll identify her body, then they'll remember the other woman.
The other woman buried in the crypt.
If they find out it was Rebecca, you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body.
That the day you went to Edgecombe, you were ill, you didn't know what you were doing.
Rebecca's dead. That's what we've got to remember.
Rebecca's dead. She can't speak. She can't bear witness.
She can't harm you anymore.
We're the only two people in the world that know, Maxim, you and I.
I'd told you once that I'd done a selfish thing in marrying you.
You can understand now what I meant.
I've loved you, my darling.
I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.
No, no. She hasn't won.
No matter what happens now, she hasn't won.
Hello?
Hello, Frank.
Hello, Frank.
Yes. Who? Colonel Julyan?
Yes. Tell him I'll meet him there as soon as I possibly can.
What?
Well...
Say we could talk about that when we're sure about the matter.
What's happened?
Colonel Julyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.
He's been asked by the police to go to the mortuary.
He wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake about that other body.
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did make a mistake about that other body.
The mistake was natural under the circumstances.
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.
Don't let it worry you, Maxim.
Nobody can blame you for making a mistake.
The pity is, you've got to go through the same thing all over again.
What do you mean?
There'll have to be another inquest, of course.
Same formality and red tape.
Wish you could be spared the publicity of it, but I'm afraid that's impossible.
Oh, yes, publicity.
I suppose Mrs. De Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat with nobody at the helm.
I imagine that's about the solution now, don't you think so, Crawley?
Oh, yes.
Probably the door jammed, and she couldn't get on deck again. Yeah.
Tabb, the boat builder, will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion.
Why, what would he know about it?
Well, he's examining the boat now. Purely as a matter of routine, you know.
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim, quite unofficially, you know.
We must get together for a game of golf when it's all over, eh?
Bye-bye.
I have the evening papers, madam. Would you care to see them?
Oh, no thank you, Frith, and I prefer that Mr. De Winter weren't troubled with them, either.
I understand, madam.
Permit me to say that we're all most distressed outside. Thank you, Frith.
I'm afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.
Yes, I rather expected it would be.
It seems there's to be a coroner's inquest, madam?
Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.
Of course, madam.
I... I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence, I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family.
Oh, thank you, Frith, why, I... I'm sure Mr. De Winter will be very happy to hear it.
But I don't think anything will be necessary.
Maxim.
Hello, darling.
Oh, Maxim, I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.
What do you mean?
You won't lose your temper, will you?
Promise me that they won't make you angry.
All right, darling. I promise.
No matter what he asks you, you won't lose your head?
Don't worry, dear.
They can't do anything at once, can they?
No.
Then we've a little time left to be together. Yes.
- I want to go to the inquest with you.
- I'd rather you didn't, darling.
But I can't wait here alone.
I promise you, I won't be any trouble to you.
And I must be near you so that no matter what happens, we won't be separated for a moment.
All right, dear.
I don't mind this whole thing except for you.
I can't forget what it's done to you.
I've been thinking of nothing else since it happened.
It's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved.
It won't ever come back.
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca.
It's gone.
In a few hours, you've grown so much older.
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.
Black Jack Brady was his name.
The most important arrest I ever made.
It must have been about two years ago now.
Of course, there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.
Hello. Wait a minute.
They've got old Balmy Ben up now.
You remember the late Mrs. De Winter, don't you?
- She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.
- She went in the sea. The sea got her. - That's right.
That's right.
Now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore - that last night she went sailing.
Were you on the shore that last night she went out, when she didn't come back?
I didn't see nothing. I don't want to go to the asylum.
Them cruel folks there.
Now, nobody's going to send you to the asylum.
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw.
I didn't see nothing.
Come, come.
Did you see Mrs. De Winter get into her boat that last night?
I don't know nothing.
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Very well. You may go.
- You may go now.
- Mr. Tabb, step forward, please.
The late Mrs. De Winter used to send her boat - to your shipyard for reconditioning.
- That's right, sir.
Can you remember any occasion when she had any sort of accident with the boat?
No, sir.
I often said Mrs. De Winter was a born sailor.
Now, when Mrs. De Winter went below, as is supposed, and a sudden gust of wind came down, that would be enough to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, sir.
But there's a little more to it than that.
- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the seacocks.
What are the seacocks?
Sea...
The seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat.
They're always kept tight closed when you're afloat.
Well, yesterday, when I examined that boat, I found they'd been opened.
What could be the reason for that?
Just this, that's what flooded the boat and sunk her.
Are you implying that boat never capsized at all?
I know it's a terrible thing to say, sir, but in my opinion, she was scuttled.
- And there's them holes.
- What holes?
- In her planking.
- What are you talking about?
Of course, that boat's been underwater for over a year, and the tide's been knocking her against the ridge.
But it seemed to me them holes looked as if she'd made them from the inside.
Then you believe she must have done it deliberately.
Couldn't have been no accident, not with her knowledge of boats.
You knew the former Mrs. De Winter very well, I believe? Oh, yes.
Would you have believed her capable of suicide? No.
Frankly, I would not.
But you never can tell.
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.
Mr. De Winter, please.
Sorry to drag you back for further questioning, Mr. De Winter. But you've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.
I wonder if you can help us in any way.
I'm afraid not.
Can you think of any reason why there should be holes in the planking of the late Mrs. De Winter's boat?
Well, of course I can't think of any reason.
Has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before?
Well, since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean,
I scarcely think that likely.
Mr. De Winter, I want you to believe we all feel very deeply for you in this matter.
But you must remember that I don't conduct this inquiry for my own amusement.
- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.
Well, since she went sailing alone, are we to believe that she drove those holes herself?
You may believe what you like.
Can you enlighten us as to why Mrs. De Winter should have wanted to end her own life?
I know of no reason whatever.
Mr. De Winter, however painful it may be, I have to ask you a very personal question.
Were relations between you and the late Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy?
I won't stand this any longer!
You might as well know now...
We'll adjourn till after lunch.
Mr. De Winter, I presume you'll be available for us then?
I told you, you should have had some breakfast. You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house, and sent me with it.
No, that's fine.
Pull around the corner. Very good, sir.
Awfully foolish of me, fainting like that.
Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted like that, I'd have really lost my temper.
Darling, please be careful.
Darling, wait here a few moments. I'll see if I can find old Frank. Of course, darling.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
Sure?
Here, try a spot of this.
Do you good.
Thank you.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course.
- I won't be long. - Right you are.
Hello.
And how does the bride find herself today?
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses, is it?
I think you'd better go before Maxim gets back.
Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.
But you don't think I'm the big bad wolf, do you?
I'm not, you know.
I'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.
And I think you're behaving splendidly over all this. Perfectly splendidly.
You know, you've grown up a bit since I last saw you. It's no wonder...
What do you want, Favell?
Oh, hello, Max.
Things are going pretty well for you, aren't they?
Better than you ever expected.
I was rather worried about you at first. That's why I came down to the inquest.
Well, I'm touched by your solicitude. But if you don't mind, we'd rather like to have our lunch.
Lunch?
I say, what a jolly idea.
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?
I'm so sorry. Do you mind if I put this there?
You know, Max, old boy, I really think I ought to talk things over with you.
Talk what things over?
Well, those holes in the planking, for one thing.
Those holes that were drilled from the inside.
- Oh, Mullen?
- Yes, sir?
Would you, like a good fellow, have my car filled with petrol? - It's almost empty. - Very good, sir.
- And, Mullen, close the door, will you? - Yes, sir.
Does this bother you?
You know, old boy, I have a strong feeling that before the day's out, somebody's going to make use of that rather expressive, though somewhat old-fashioned term, "foul play. "
Am I boring you with all this?
No?
Good. Well, you see, Max, I find myself in a rather awkward position.
You've only got to read this note to understand.
It's from Rebecca.
And, what's more, she had the foresight to put a date on it.
She wrote me the day she died.
Incidentally, I was at a party on that night so I didn't get it until the next day.
And what makes you think that note would interest me?
Oh, I'm not gonna bother you with the contents now. But I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night.
By the way, what do you do with old bones?
Bury them?
However, for the time being...
You know, Max, I'm getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman.
I don't know if you've ever experienced the feeling of driving an expensive motorcar which isn't your own?
But it can be very, very exasperating.
You know what I mean. You want to own the car yourself.
I often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country. Have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting.
I've never figured out what it would cost a year, but I'd like to talk about it with you.
I'd like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work.
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?
Yes.
Mr. Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand.
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn.
They may have a private room there.
Well, see you later.
Find Colonel Julyan. Tell him I want to see him immediately.
Come on, Favell. Let's go.
- Have you a private room, please?
- Of course, sir.
Through there, sir.
Hope this will do, Mr. De Winter.
Splendid. Splendid. Exactly like the Ritz.
Any orders, gents? Yes.
You might bring me a large brandy and soda.
How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.
Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
Make it two, will you, like a good fellow? - Very good, sir.
Where's Mr. De Winter?
Through the other door, sir.
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan. We're old friends, aren't we?
Since you're old friends, I assume you also know he's head of the police here.
He might be interested to hear your proposition. Tell him all about it.
I don't know what you mean. I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars and retire into the country.
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if I made it worth his while.
I only want to see justice done, Colonel.
Now, that boat builder's evidence suggested certain possible theories concerning Rebecca's death.
One of them, of course, is suicide.
Now I have a little note here which I consider puts that possibility quite out of court.
Read it, Colonel.
"Jack, darling,
I've just seen the doctor and I'm going down to Manderley right away.
I shall be at the cottage all this evening and shall leave the door open for you.
I have something terribly important to tell you.
Rebecca. "
Now, does that look like the note of a woman who had made up her mind to kill herself?
And apart from that, do you mean to tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide, you would go to all the trouble of putting out to sea in a boat, and then take a hammer and chisel and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it?
Come, Colonel. As an officer of the law, don't you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion?
- Of murder?
- What else?
You've known Max a long time.
So you know he's the old-fashioned type, who'd die to defend his honor, or who'd kill for it.
It's blackmail, pure and simple.
Blackmail is not so pure, nor so simple.
It can bring a lot of trouble to a great many people.
And the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it.
Oh, I see. You're going to hold de Winter's hand through all this. Just because he's the big noise around here and he's actually permitted you to dine with him.
Be careful, Favell. You've brought an accusation of murder.
- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.
It's that fellow, Ben.
If that stupid coroner hadn't been as much of a snob as you are, he'd have seen that half-wit was hiding something.
And why should Ben do that?
Because we caught him once, Rebecca and I, peering at us through the cottage window.
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum. That's why he was afraid to speak.
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.
It's ridiculous, even listening to all this.
You're like a little trade union, all of you, aren't you?
And if my guess is right, Crawley, there's a bit of malice in your soul toward me, isn't there?
Crawley didn't have much success with Rebecca, but he ought to have more luck this time.
And the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm, Crawley, in a week or so.
Every time she faints, in fact. - De Winter!
- Maxim, please!
That temper of yours will do you in yet, Max.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Now is there anything else?
- Yes. You might bring Mr. De Winter a sedative.
- No, no. Nothing at all. Just leave us.
Now, Favell, let's get this business over.
As you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully, perhaps you can provide us also with a motive.
I knew you were going to bring that up, Colonel.
I've read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive.
And if you'll all excuse me, I might supply that, too.
I wish you'd go home.
You ought not to be here through all this.
Please let me stay, Maxim.
Surely, Colonel Julyan, you're not going to allow this fellow to...
My opinion of Favell is no higher than yours, Crawley.
But in my official capacity, I have no alternative but to pursue his accusations.
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.
In matters as serious as this, we must make sure of every point and explore every avenue.
And in fact, if I may coin a phrase, leave no stone unturned.
Here she is, the missing link, the witness who will help supply the motive.
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers. I believe you know everyone else.
Won't you sit down?
No offense, Colonel, but I think I'll put this to Danny. She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?
Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McClean from the village.
Now, you heard. I said Rebecca's doctor in London.
I don't know anything about that.
Oh, don't give me that, Danny. You knew everything about Rebecca.
You knew she was in love with me, didn't you?
Surely you haven't forgotten the good times she and I used to have down at the cottage on the beach.
She had a right to amuse herself, didn't she?
Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.
She used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you.
Can you think of why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her own life?
No, no. I refuse to believe it.
I knew everything about her and I won't believe it.
There. You see? It's impossible.
Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London on the last day of her life.
Who was it?
I don't know.
I understand, Danny.
You think we're asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.
You're trying to defend her. But that's what I'm doing.
I'm trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide.
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested that Mrs. De Winter was deliberately murdered.
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.
But there's one more thing you'll want to know, the name of the murderer.
It's a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily.
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.
There was a doctor.
Mrs. De Winter sometimes went to him privately. She used to go to him even before she was married.
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
Dr. Baker. 165 Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush.
There you are, Colonel. There's where you'll find your motive.
Go and question Dr. Baker. He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him.
To confirm the fact that she was going to have a child. A sweet, curly-headed little child.
It isn't true.
It isn't true. She would have told me.
She told Max about it. Max knew he wasn't the father.
So, like the gentleman of the old school that he is, he killed her.
I'm afraid we shall have to question this Dr. Baker.
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake, I think I'd like to go along, too.
Yes. Unfortunately, I suppose you have the right to ask that.
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed pending further evidence.
I say, aren't you rather afraid that the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?
You have my word for it that he will not do that.
Toodle-oo, Max. Come along, Danny. Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you, Max?
No, darling. It'll be very tiring for you.
I'll be back the very first thing in the morning.
- And I won't even stop to sleep.
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Ready, Maxim? - Yes.
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.
Dr. Baker, you may have seen Mr. De Winter's name in the papers recently.
Yes. Yes. In connection with the body that was found in a boat.
My wife was reading all about it. A very sad case.
My condolences. This is going to take hours.
Let me...
Don't bother, Favell. I think I can tell Dr. Baker.
We're trying to discover certain facts concerning the late Mrs. De Winter's activities on the day of her death.
October the 12th, last year.
I want you to tell me if you can, if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date?
I'm awfully sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you.
I should have remembered the name de Winter.
I've never attended a Mrs. De Winter in my life.
How can you possibly tell all your patients' names?
I can look it up in my engagement diary if you like.
- Did you say the 12th of October? Yes.
Here we are.
No. No de Winter.
Are you sure?
Well, here are all the appointments for that day.
Ross, Campbell, Steadall, Perrino, Danvers...
- Danny? What the devil?
- Would you read that name again?
Did you say Danvers?
Yes. I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.
What did she look like? Can you remember?
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman.
- Tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.
Rebecca.
The lady must have used an assumed name.
Is that so?
This is a surprise. I've known her a long time.
What was the matter with her?
Well, there are certain ethics.
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker, for Mrs. De Winter's suicide?
For her murder, you mean?
She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?
Come on. Out with it!
Tell me, what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this?
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to...
I assure you we'd not be troubling you if it were not necessary.
You want to know if I can suggest any motive as to why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her life?
Yes, I think I can.
The woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.
She was not going to have a child?
That was what she thought.
My diagnosis was different.
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays.
And on this date, she returned to me for his report.
I remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph.
"I want to know the truth, " she said.
"I don't want soft words and a bedside manner.
If I'm for it, you can tell me right away. "
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie.
She'd asked for the truth, so I let her have it.
She thanked me. I never saw her again, so I assumed...
- What was wrong with her?
- Cancer.
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.
An operation would have been no earthly use at all.
In a short time, she would have been under morphia.
There was nothing that could be done for her, except wait.
Did she say anything when you told her?
She smiled in a queer sort of way.
Your wife was a wonderful woman, Mr. De Winter.
And, oh, yes, I remember she said something that struck me as being very peculiar at the time.
When I told her it was a matter of months, she said,
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long. "
You've been very kind. You've told us all we wanted to know.
We shall need an official verification. - Verification?
- Yes. - To confirm the verdict of suicide.
I understand.
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry? No, that's very kind.
I think we ought to be going.
Thank heaven we know the truth. Dreadful thing.
Dreadful.
Young and lovely woman like that.
No wonder...
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.
I wish I had a drink.
Will we be needed at the inquest any further, Colonel Julyan? No, no.
I can see to it that Maxim's not troubled any further.
- Thank you, sir.
- You ready to start, Colonel?
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.
And let me tell you, Favell, blackmail is not much of a profession.
And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world, strange as it may seem to you.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
But if you ever need a new car, Colonel, just let me know.
It's impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this. You know what I feel without my saying it.
Not at all.
Put the whole thing behind you.
But let your wife know. She'll be getting worried. Yes, of course.
I'll phone her at once and we'll get straight down to Manderley.
Goodbye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?
- There's something you don't know.
- Oh, no, there isn't.
I didn't kill her, Frank.
But I know now that when she told me about the child, she wanted me to kill her.
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.
That's why she stood there laughing when she...
Don't think about it anymore.
Thank you, Frank.
Hello, Danny.
I just wanted to tell you the news.
Rebecca held out on both of us.
She had cancer.
Yes, suicide.
Now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after.
Bye-bye, Danny.
- This your car, sir?
- Yes. Will you be going soon? This isn't a parking place, you know.
Oh, isn't it?
Well, people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to.
It's a pity some of you fellows haven't anything better to do.
When you phoned, did she say she'd wait up?
I asked her to go to bed, but she wouldn't hear of it.
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing.
Is something worrying you, Maxim?
I can't get over the feeling something's wrong.
- Frank.
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?
What's the time?
Well, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?
That can't be the dawn breaking over there.
It's in the winter that you see the northern lights, isn't it?
That's not the northern lights. That's Manderley.
Frith!
Mrs. De Winter. Where is she?
- I thought I saw her, sir.
Maxim!
Thank heavens you've come back to me!
- Are you all right, darling? - Oh, yes, I am.
Are you all right?
Mrs. Danvers, she's gone mad.
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here.
Look! The west wing!
The riches of the New World are limitless, and the New World is ours... with our ships carrying the Spanish flag to the seven seas... our armies sweeping over Africa, the Near East, and the Far West... invincible everywhere but on our own doorstep.
Only Northern Europe holds out against us.
Why? Tell me.
If you will permit me, sire. Our depleted treasury. An army can advance only to the end of its purse strings.
Nonsense.
That is not the real reason, Peralta.
Why not admit it? The reason is a puny rock-bound island as barren and treacherous as her queen... who secretly gives aid to our enemies while her pirates plunder our commerce.
You know as well as I, Peralta... we cannot keep Northern Europe in submission... until we have a reckoning with England.
It is not yet time, Your Majesty. Not until the Armada is built.
Time?
The destiny of Spain cannot wait upon the fitness of time.
I have but one life... and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny.
-Don Alvarez. -Sire.
You will proceed at once to England as my ambassador. You will assure the Queen of my patience and continued affection... to allay any suspicion in regard to our plans.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
With England conquered, nothing can stand in our way.
Northern Africa, Europe as far east as the Urals... then the New World, to the north, to the south... west to the Pacific, over the Pacific to China and the Indies... will our empire spread.
One day, before my death... we shall sit here and gaze at this map upon the wall.
It will have ceased to be a map of the world. It will be Spain.
Aloft, there! Hold taut on the bowline.
We're losing the wind!
I regret our slow passage, Your Excellency... but it seems our sail cannot entice the wind.
Then we shall not reach England by Wednesday.
Perhaps. If the galley holds out.
Capt. Lopez, it is extremely important my niece be presented to the Queen... before her new maids of honor are chosen.
They say Elizabeth surrounds herself with beauty... in the hope that it may be contagious.
Your niece will have no trouble meeting the Queen's requirements.
Maria, you might hit it once where I can reach it.
You said you needed the exercise, Martha.
I've had it, enough for the whole voyage.
-Ready, Martha? -Yes, love.
-Lieutenant. -Sir.
Send another lookout aloft to the mizzentop.
Another lookout aloft to the mizzentop! Why these extra precautions, Captain? Isn't the fo'c'sle lookout enough?
I am responsible for your safety, Your Excellency... and we are entering the lanes of the English pirates.
How very interesting.
If your men spy any of their ships, I wish you'd let me know.
Like hawks, Don Alvarez, they're on you before you see them.
They say the devil blows in their sails.
Surely you don't believe these myths?
They would hardly dare attack a ship with His Majesty's ambassador aboard. It'd be as much as their heads are worth when news reaches the Queen.
Perhaps.
Excuse me, Your Excellency, but the wind does not serve well.
-Aye, aye, sir. -Raise the beat eight counts.
-At once, Captain.
There below, raise the beat of the oars eight counts.
Aye, aye. Eight counts, señor. Raise the beat eight counts.
-I know where we are.
-You can't tell, William.
We haven't known where we were for months.
I'm sure this time. Feel the motion, the groundswell?
Only one place like that.
The English Channel.
The English Channel. We're in the English Channel.
English ship off the starboard bow!
Bo's'n, have the drummers beat to quarters.
Master gunner, have the deck cannon double-shotted.
An attack.
Hold back on your oars. Pretend to row.
Hold back on your oars.
Have your men in position.
To your stations.
Gun crews, to your stations.
Charge your cannon and stand ready to repel attack.
Send the archers and musketmen to their positions.
Archers and musketmen, to your stations!
Master-at-arms, double the guard at the main hatch.
Run out your guns. Train your sights to his rigging.
I must ask you to go below. You will not be safe here.
The pirates won't dare attack when they see the King's emblem.
Guns may stop them. Nothing else.
-Raise the beat to 20. -Aye, aye, señor!
Raise the beat to 20. Get together!
Together, I said. Faster, you British dogs.
Ahoy, Captain. It's Thorpe's ship.
The Albatross.
Thorpe?
Why, that's impossible. Only a month ago he was at San Domingo.
Look, Captain, on the staff. The banner of the Albatross.
You better take cover below, matey, or you'll be stopping a cannonball.
She's hauling closer to the wind!
Feast your eyes on that. The Spaniard mounts 40 guns if she mounts one.
She's loaded down, too.
Maybe she's too big a bite for our teeth, eh, Matson?
Ever see a Spaniard the Captain couldn't swallow whole?
Captain's got the Spaniards bewitched, that's what he has.
Yes, and didn't we dust off His Royal Highness' britches in Cádiz, too?
I mind that, me lad... and the dust was worth 30 shillings to the ounce.
What a prize. I don't think she'll get away from us.
The Albatross isn't a barge you can run away from.
We're sucking the wind out of the Spaniards' sails.
If it's air they need, we can put a draft through their bow pretty quick.
Captain, what about it? Shall we let them have a round?
-You'll fire when I give the word, Mr. Pitt. -Aye, aye, sir.
-Mr. Preston! -Aye, aye, sir.
Give them a hail, if you please.
-Suggest they lower their colors. -Aye, aye, sir.
Señor Captain, lower your flag!
It would be just like that Spaniard to surrender and spoil our fun.
Perfectly possible, Mr. Pitt.
Once more, Mr. Preston.
You hear me?
Lower your flag!
One lone cannonball out of an entire broadside.
Very well, Mr. Pitt. Show them how to lower those colors.
Aye, aye, sir. Scott, teach them some etiquette.
Ready, men?
Lay for the foremast and fire on the uproll.
-Cannons ready for a broadside?
-Primed and ready, sir.
Fire!
Stand by to come about on the larboard tack.
Gunners, stand by to rake her stern!
Put out the fire. Heave the dead overboard!
-Now hard at starboard. -Starboard your helm!
The Spaniard's listing. We must have hit it below the waterline.
Very good, Burke.
Cease firing.
It's cutlasses now, men.
We're going to board her!
A sharp edge, to cut the gold buttons off the Spanish captain's doublet.
Nobody's to board her before I give the word. Is that clear?
All right, Mr. Preston.
Haul into her hard over starboard.
Grappling hooks away!
Over the side, men. Boarders away!
-Your ship's sinking, Captain.
-Then we shall drown together.
Brave but impractical. We English are a practical people.
I have no intention of drowning with you.
-The trumpeter. Quick, near the fo'c'sle. -Aye, aye, sir.
Sound the surrender. Hurry, while there's still breath in your belly.
I congratulate you, Captain. Very fortunate moment for the surrender.
You take charge. Muster the prisoners and stack the weapons forward.
-To the main deck, men.
Disarm them. -Aye, aye, sir!
It's been a lovely day, hasn't it?
Take enough men, go below, and free the slaves.
Matson. Come here.
You were very brave, trying to take this ship single-handed.
Thank you, sir.
Brave but stupid.
By disobeying orders, you risked the lives of the men behind you.
-Shouldn't you pay for that with your own? -Yes, sir.
Take this man aboard the Albatross. Have him put in irons.
But, Captain, I was only doing me duty.
You can't blame a man for that!
By the way... I'd appreciate it if you'd pass the word among the officers and men... that I consider their conduct very gallant.
And yours especially, Mr. Pitt. Thank you for convincing the trumpeter.
-Looks like a very rich cargo, Mr. Pitt. -A windfall, Captain, sir.
-Gold, silver, and plenty of barrel stuff. -Look sharp there, boys.
-Get it up on deck. She's settling fast.
-This door's locked, sir.
Lend him a hand there, will you, Mr. Pitt?
-Uncle. -My child.
Now, men, let's look around in here.
If you'd be kind enough to stand to one side, please.
Are you the captain of these pirates?
Burke, lend Mr. Pitt a hand with this chest.
Throw everything outside in the passageway. Quickly.
-Couple of extra hands in here, sharp.
-Come on. -I am King Phillip's ambassador--
-You'll pardon me, sir. We're pressed for time. Your ship is sinking.
Mr. Pitt, if you find the ship's papers, we'll take those aboard, too.
Captain. Not at all bad.
Uncle, my jewels.
Don't you dare touch those jewels.
By heavens, an Englishwoman.
And not too proud of it at the moment.
You know, the last time I saw an Englishwoman--
You'll have time to discuss that later.
Let's get that sharply out onto the deck.
Your Excellency, Maria, these are not typical Englishmen.
-Please don't think-- -Quite right.
They ain't all as handsome as we are.
Sir, if I may suggest... you and your party had better go aboard my vessel.
Capt. Thorpe, I demand to know exactly what your intentions are.
To get you safely aboard my ship. And to get you off again as quickly as possible. -I'll land you at the first English port.
-I'll not go on your ship. I'd rather drown than accept your hospitality.
Mr. Pitt, this young lady, I hope, will change her mind.
If she doesn't, change it for her and have her carried aboard.
These men are weak. Get them over the side.
See they don't fall.
Come along, ladies. You heard what the Captain said. And orders are orders.
Why, Tuttle, it must be four years since we sailed together.
It's four years since I've trod the deck of an English ship, sir.
You'll soon be in England now.
Come along, all of you, and I'll see you all catch up with your rum rations.
Capt. Thorpe, this is an insult to His Majesty.
I board your ship under protest.
At least you'll find English hospitality better than they found Spanish.
As soon as the slaves are transferred... see that the Ambassador and his party get on board, too.
All right, men. Stand by, ready to move.
Make speed there, men. Get that stuff loaded below.
Keep those rails clear. Lively, now.
Abandon ship. Everybody over the side.
Now, then, Captain. You heard the order.
With your permission, sir. I'm still the Captain.
Yes, of course. My mistake, Captain.
Let go of those lines. Watch your amidships.
I'll have all sails trimmed, if you please, Mr. Scott.
Quartermaster?
-Hold her steady as she goes. -Steady as she goes.
Men, from now on, both crews will lay aside past differences.
Spanish sailors will have full freedom of the decks... with the exception of the powder magazine.
Those of you lately called slaves will have no further duties aboard this ship.
If there are those among you who are still for the sea... we've plenty of berths on this ship for good and willing men.
By now you know the purpose of the Sea Hawks: In our own way, to serve England and the Queen.
Mr. Burke, dismiss all these men and attend to their needs.
Your Excellency, we'll try to make you and your party as comfortable... as this somewhat overcrowded ship permits.
Mr. Pitt will show you the way.
Are my men to be freed when we land?
Certainly, Captain. We have no lnquisition in England.
No. We understand you believe in direct action.
Don Alvarez, I can appreciate your feelings... but since fate has thrown us together, let's make the best of it.
It was a clever strategy, Capt. Thorpe, to sound the surrender.
Thank you. Perhaps one of the secrets of victory... is making your enemy anticipate defeat, don't you agree?
-More wine, Your Excellency? -No, thank you.
I must compliment you on your wine, Captain.
Nowhere have I tasted better.
There is no better wine than good Madeira, Captain.
Cross, just where did we pick this up?
-From the galleon off Veracruz, Captain. -No, it wasn't.
It was out of the governor's cellar at Cartagena.
No, Cartagena's the place we had all the Portuguese cheeses, remember?
But there's no cheese like Cheshire, is there, Mr. Pitt?
No place like England for anything, I think.
I was just thinking to myself, Miss Latham... weren't you a bit lonesome in a heathen country like Spain?
Spain is an old country with a very rich culture, Mr. Pitt.
In fact, there is much in Spain that we English could profit by.
Thank you, madam.
We're certainly doing the best we can.
I have also been admiring your table silver, Captain.
No doubt another of the Captain's acquisitions.
No doubt. Perhaps if Your Excellency will examine the design... you'll recognize the coat of arms of the Spanish Viceroy of San Domingo.
San Domingo? How interesting.
I should like to propose that we drink to the health of....
I do not drink with thieves and pirates.
The health I was about to propose was to Her Majesty, the Queen of England.
Mr. Pitt, obviously Doña Maria has no wine.
-To Her Majesty the Queen. -To the Queen.
"Build a fleet. Build a fleet."
Always the same advice.
As if I didn't have enough demands on my treasury.
If my Lord Admiral is so intent on building a fleet... perhaps he will also advise me where to get the money to pay for it.
Your pardon, but may I remind Your Grace... that our privateers have made substantial contributions... for the very purpose of providing a navy?
A large fleet is a luxury England can ill afford.
Tell your friends the Sea Hawks I have more urgent uses for their contributions.
Besides, there's another risk which Sir John fails to reckon. Should England attempt to vie in sea power... it may cost her the friendship of Spain.
I believe milord values too highly something which doesn't exist.
Have we any evidence of Phillip's friendship?
His forbearance when our privateers harass his commerce... and plunder his possessions.
I suspect Phillip forbears only because....
What else can he do?
He can bide his time, until his great armada is built... and then he can strike quickly before we are ready.
I fear Sir John has delusions of danger, Your Grace.
Spain is a vast empire. Naturally, she needs a vast fleet to defend it.
The Armada's no threat to England... unless, by provoking Phillip, we choose to make it so.
Let me be clear, Wolfingham. My reason for refusing to build a fleet... is to spare the purses of my subjects, not the feelings of Phillip.
In fact, I have some serious questions to put to his ambassador.
Is Don Alvarez not due?
Overdue, Your Grace.
I feel some concern for his safety.
Spanish ships are notoriously slow.
He should have come on an English boat.
Eleven bells, and all's well!
Look at him, will you? He's as tongue-tied as a schoolboy.
He's always the same when he has to talk to a woman.
Him what's taken fleets of Spanish ships can't trade words with a slip of a girl.
-I can't figure him at all. -Ship's the only thing he cares about.
-He hates the sight of blooming women. -Not the Queen, he don't.
I hear Her Majesty's the only woman he could talk up to... without his knees buckling.
That's different. Man to man, I calls it.
Come on, get on with your work. What are you standing there for?
Good morning.
Have you been comfortable on board?
-Yes. -Good.
That promontory over there, the one you're looking at... it's got a very interesting history.
It got its name from....
Yes?
I don't remember how it got its name.
Have you been comfortable on board?
-Yes, thank you. -Good.
Of course, we haven't many of the luxuries of a galleass... but she's a fine ship. We're quite proud of her.
Are you?
Yes.
At all events, you'll find her safer from attack... and you'll get there quicker, too.
We've an old proverb in England. It says:
"Those who sail without oars stay on good terms with the wind."
You don't care to talk.
I'm not in the habit of conversing with thieves.
I thought I made that quite clear, Capt. Thorpe.
Yes, all except your definition.
Tell me, is a thief an Englishman who steals?
It's anybody who steals, whether it's piracy or robbing women.
I see.
I've been admiring some of the jewels we found in your chest... particularly the wrought gold.
It's Aztec, isn't it?
I wonder just how those Indians were persuaded to part with it.
Ease your foresheet!
Haul in your spritsail!
England.
-Your Grace. -Lord Wolfingham. With Your Grace's permission, I wish to present to Your Majesty...
His Excellency Don José Alvarez de Cordoba... Ambassador from the court of Spain.
-Your Majesty. -Welcome to England, Your Excellency.
Thank you, milady. May I present my niece, Doña Maria Alvarez de Cordoba?
Your niece will grace England by her presence.
You're very kind, Your Majesty.
And you are very beautiful.
Don Alvarez... my Lord Chancellor informs me you bring new grievances... from your much-aggrieved monarch, King Phillip.
There is nothing my lord and king desires more... than an end to grievances between our two nations... and the growth of friendship.
Then it may be well to consider friendship grows slowly... when nurtured only by complaints.
May I suggest that the misunderstandings... between ourselves and His Excellency's government... arise from one source alone: the piratical acts of English privateers.
Reprisals, Lord Wolfingham, are not piratical acts.
Last year, did not King Phillip confiscate 12 English ships... loaded with grain in Spanish ports?
Do I understand Your Grace to justify... this murderous assault on my ship on the grounds of--
You forget, Don Alvarez, the Queen needs justify nothing.
However, I had no intention of forgetting an insult to an ambassador to the court. How much treasure was there, Don Alvarez?
Approximately £30,000, besides the loss of the ship.
And where is Capt. Thorpe?
As soon as I was informed of the incident... I took the liberty of summoning here all the Sea Hawks now in port.
You are very thoughtful, milord.
Admit the Sea Hawks at once.
Your Majesty.
Where is Capt. Thorpe?
Did you hear me? Where is Capt. Thorpe?
We haven't seen him, Your Majesty.
It appears he disregarded my Lord Chancellor's summons.
I anticipated that, Your Grace, and dispatched a castle guard... to bring him here under arrest.
You show great foresight, milord.
Well, Capt. Hawkins?
Any of us would willingly act as hostage... to assure Your Grace of Capt. Thorpe's appearance.
An easy pledge, Capt. Hawkins... with the castle guards already dispatched to bring him here.
If I may speak for my associates...
I feel we must share the burden of your displeasure with Capt. Thorpe.
I see. You approve of his activities.
We share his views, Your Grace... and, to the best of our ability, his activities on behalf of England.
Then hereafter you will allow me to determine... in what manner England may best be served!
Who dares to....
Capt. Thorpe begs an immediate audience, Your Grace.
-Admit him. -Yes, Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
Capt. Thorpe, why did you fail to answer Lord Wolfingham's summons?
I was in the castle at the appointed time, but I had an accident. -An accident? -Perhaps not exactly an accident.
I lost something to which I was quite attached.
Capt. Thorpe, I dispatched a castle guard to bring you here.
Thank you, milord. That was very kind of you. The escort was really not necessary.
I have a more serious charge preferred against you.
His Excellency, Don Alvarez, ambassador to this court... states that you did attack, plunder, and sink the galleass Santa Eulàlia... on which he was a passenger under the flag and protection... of his sovereign, King Phillip of Spain.
Is this charge true?
Part of it, Your Grace. Quite a large part.
Part of it?
What's the rest?
We also set free many Englishmen imprisoned as galley slaves on his ship.
Your Grace, these men referred to by Capt. Thorpe... were duly tried and sentenced to the galley by a qualified court.
I submit, Your Grace, that the court of the Inquisition... is not qualified to pass fair judgment on English seamen... nor to subject them to the cruelties of a Spanish galley.
Your Grace. The Captain wishes to justify what, in plain words... is a desire for plunder with no respect for the interests of Spain.
The interests of Spain do not command my respect...
-as they evidently do his lordship's.
-I protest! Capt. Thorpe, you will at least show the proper respect for my ministers.
So you have taken it upon yourself to remedy the defects of Spanish justice?
Insofar as it lies within my power, yes, Your Grace.
And you conceive it to be part of your mission... to assault and loot the ship of an ambassador to the court?
Capt. Thorpe, do you imagine that we are at war with Spain?
Your Grace, Spain is at war with the world.
Enough of this.
Listen to me, every one of you.
Never again will you dare in my presence... to condone your crimes under the mask of patriotism.
No more of such talk, do you hear?
And for the future, let me warn you... that any unwarranted attack upon Spanish subjects or their property... will cost the guilty party his head.
His head, is that clear?
Now you may go.
No, not you, Capt. Thorpe. I'm not finished with you.
Captain of the Guard... you will accompany Capt. Thorpe to my private chamber... where he will wait my further pleasure.
Don Alvarez, you may convey my regrets to His Majesty King Phillip... and assure him that this unhappy incident will have no recurrence.
My humble thanks, Your Grace.
And may I also inform him... that the offender in this instance will be forced to make full restitution?
You will tell him exactly what I told you to tell him. Nothing more.
So that's where you've been.
What do you mean by running away and keeping me late for my appointment?
I've got a good mind to pull your tail. It's very ungrateful of you.
Do you realize how few monkeys have a chance to live in a palace?
No, that's wrong. There's quite a few of you here already.
However, watch your manners, and if your mistress takes a fancy to you... just put in a good word for me.
I think I'm going to need it.
Well, what's your excuse this time?
My small friend from Brazil was so anxious... to pay his respects to Your Grace that he selected his own method.
Evidently more anxious than you, when he paid my court an earlier visit.
So that's where he was. I was looking for him, Your Grace. That's why I was late.
Why on earth did you bring him here?
I thought he might amuse milady, which is more than I could hope to do.
-He looks like Wolfingham. -Yes, Madam.
The teeth, the smile, exactly.
He's very friendly, Madam. He won't harm you.
You're a rascal, like your former master.
But I'm fond of rascals. Some of them.
This is the nearest we have to a tree.
Now behave yourself.
-And now to.... Capt. Thorpe!
-For you, Madam.
As soon as I saw it, I thought immediately of you.
I see the light in it, like a candle in a frosted window.
-A West Indian pearl, is it not? -Yes, Madam.
By some mischance it was on its way to Spain when I diverted it.
You might say I came between Phillip and the oyster.
I fear Wolfingham is right. You are an incorrigible pirate.
No, Madam. But I do have a conscience about pearls.
They should only be worn by one whose throat matches their own luster.
And have you any other scruples?
One only, Madam. That is never willfully to displease you.
But have you?
I trust not, but one can be mistaken.
I should not advise you to make a practice... of diverting Spanish ambassadors.
The ambassador's galleass was already propelled by English oars. I merely substituted English sails.
We have moral rights on our side. Spain has the law on hers. -Bear that in mind in your future ventures.
Now to business.
I understand your voyage was very profitable.
Unusually so, Madam.
An inventory of the treasure, with the crown's share at your disposal.
Excellent. I shall put it to good use.
If what I've done has pleased Your Grace, I have a favor to ask.
That our contributions induce you to begin work on the fleet.
-Fleet. Must I listen to that from you, too?
-The Armada, Your Grace.
-Are you so sure that Phillip will attack?
-Have you any assurance that he won't?
With all the contributions of the Sea Hawks... we cannot possibly match Phillip's vast resources.
Our safety lies in diplomacy, not force.
Madam, suppose Phillip's vast resources, or at least a large portion of them... were not to reach him? Were to be, shall I say, diverted?
What then?
Just what is going on in that piratical mind of yours?
Your Grace, the lifeblood of Spain lies in her New World treasure.
Within three months, a year's plunder in gold leaves Panama, bound for Spain.
-With 10 good privateering ships--
-I forbid it.
An attack on the gold fleet would be regarded by Phillip as an act of war... which even I could not explain away.
Very well, Madam. Let it be a single enterprise.
One ship, the Albatross, with a picked crew.
Impossible. A Spanish convoy would overwhelm you.
On the sea, yes, but I have a different plan, Your Majesty.
Attack them on land, as they robbed the Aztecs and the Incas.
The treasure's stored in Panama, near the inland city of Ventacruz.
From there it's taken by mule caravan to the coastal town of Nombre de Dios. A distance of 60 leagues.
Look you, Madam, with your permission.
My plan is to sail down into the Caribbean from the north.
I'll meet fewer Spanish ships that way. Anchor the Albatross in a secluded inlet, land my men and supplies.
Camp in the hills until I find out from the natives... when the caravan begins moving.
From Nombre de Dios to Ventacruz, this strip here... is jungle so thick and dense... that a small force could attack from ambush.
Our plunder would be the richest prize ever brought back to England.
-Could such a plan possibly succeed? -lt would have one chance of success:
If the Spanish were taken by complete surprise.
Have I your permission to try, Madam?
If you undertook such a venture... you would do so without the approval of the Queen of England... but you would take with you the grateful affection... of Elizabeth.
Then, Madam, I shall take with me that which I prize above all things.
Don't you think, my dear, we could manage with what we have?
I'd like a few more.
Look, Martha. Don't you think this one is pretty?
Very pretty, but you've quite a lot just like it.
There's a different species over here.
It's a little darker. You see?
I see.
-What is it?
-Nothing.
-What are you thinking about?
-I was just thinking about our voyage.
I must say, I prefer English boats to Spanish boats.
There's more air on them.
You must excuse me, my dear. It's time for me to go. You better take these.
Don't go, Martha.
-No, no. -Martha, wait for me.
Don't leave me. Martha!
-May I help you? -Thank you.
You seem to be very fond of English roses.
My mother told me about your rose gardens. She was English.
That explains a great deal.
But I prefer the Spanish iris.
Naturally. It has no thorns.
Capt. Thorpe, I didn't get a chance on the boat... but I want to thank you for returning my jewels.
I'm so sorry for what I said about your robbing women.
If you think it would do any good, I'd be glad to speak to the Queen. To tell her how kindly you treated us and that we don't want you punished.
That's very kind of you indeed.
I think I can stand the punishment, but I'm very grateful for your concern.
I wonder if you can imagine how much it means to me.
No, I haven't any notion.
When I saw you first... I thought you were like a statue. Beautiful but cold.
Then I watched you when you saw the slaves... and the statue seemed to come to life.
I thought perhaps you'd forgive me one day.
Capt. Thorpe, I have forgiven you.
Is forgiveness all you feel?
Have I led you to believe anything else?
Not by anything you've said... but I thought I saw something in your eyes.
No, you're mistaken.
I'm sorry.
You're mistaken.
Perhaps that's as well, since I'm going back to sea.
-What? -We'll be gone quite some time.
Are you leaving soon?
Within a week or so, just as soon as the Albatross is ready.
The roses look different when you hold them.
In the garden of a convent in Peru, there's a beautiful statue.
The nuns call it Nuestra Señora de Las Flores.
That's how I'll always think of you, as my lady of the roses.
-Where are you bound, mate? -I'm blessed if I know.
Pass it along here.
-You taking on sailors?
-See Mr. Pitt, top of the gangplank.
Lieutenant, here's another one coming up to sign on.
Pass it along here, boys. Come along.
Pitt will assign you to your duties and your quarters.
Michael Sweeney, and I'll give you my best, sir.
-Jones, sign him. -Thank you, Captain.
Tuttle, I didn't expect to see you back so soon.
-I'm a sailor, Captain.
-And a right good one.
Just the kind we need on a trip like this. Report to Mr. Pitt on the upper deck.
Next.
Eli Matson. What are you doing on board here?
Captain, if you don't mind my asking, but I suppose after what I done... there ain't no place for me on the Albatross?
I might find a berth for you as a cabin boy.
There's always a berth for a good man... particularly when he's learned how to obey orders.
Captain, there ain't no man on earth I'd rather serve under.
-I'll make it up to you. Thank you, sir.
-See you do. -Name? -Samuel Kroner.
-Age?
-42.
-Last vessel?
-The Dorsey, sir.
-Papers? -Didn't bring them with me, sir.
I wasn't ready to sign till I knew where you were shipping.
You weren't?
Don't a man have a right to know what he's signing on for?
Not on board this ship, he hasn't.
My men follow without questions. Get ashore.
Next.
And I said to myself: "This isn't the usual preparation. This voyage is something different."
That's all I could find out, Your Lordship.
Not a man in his crew knows where he's going.
Kroner, Thorpe's destination is of vital importance.
We'll have him watched from now until the day he sails.
The money will be placed at your disposal by my steward.
Very good, Your Lordship.
Then this pirate is free again to plunder where he chooses, in spite of the Queen.
Or perhaps for the Queen.
Hereafter we shall do better to rely on our own devices... than on the assurances of a clever woman.
Surely she would not neglect to inform her Lord Chancellor... of the nature of such an important voyage?
Her Grace did inform me... that Capt. Thorpe is undertaking a trading expedition up the Nile.
I pretended to believe her.
Does that reassure Your Excellency?
Forgive me, milord, if any suspicion crossed my mind.
His Majesty King Phillip has implicit confidence... in your loyalty to his interests.
His Gracious Majesty and I have an interest in common.
A ruler friendly to Spain on the throne of England.
Like you, Lord Wolfingham?
Don Alvarez, we serve others best... when at the same time we serve ourselves.
Sure you have enough information on these waters?
Every bay and inlet for harboring a ship, soundings accurate, not a reef missing.
That's what I want. I'll send for it on Wednesday.
I'll have it ready for you, sir. You can rely on me.
I don't want any printing on the chart, you understand?
No names at all.
No names. Very good, sir.
-Good day.
-Good day, Capt. Thorpe.
I'll have it ready for you Wednesday.
-How do you do, gentlemen?
-Are you the chart maker?
-At your service. -I am Lord Wolfingham. This is Don Alvarez de Cordoba, ambassador from King Phillip of Spain.
I am honored, Your Excellency and milord.
I've been boasting to His Excellency about English chart-making.
I'm anxious for him to see samples of your work. Perhaps some charts you are in process of making?
Certainly, sir.
Would His Excellency prefer navigation charts or maps?
The charts, please.
My government may wish to compare them with their own.
Very good, sir.
If you will notice, sir, all my charts are drawn on the very best parchment... and mounted on the finest linen.
The numbers every half-inch along the coastline... indicate the depth of the ocean in fathoms at that point.
This is very interesting.
I just finished that when you gentlemen came in.
Here is a section of the west coast of Africa.
You will notice it is worked out with such detail... that a navigator can sail through waters unknown with perfect safety.
-Yes, indeed. Excellent work.
-Here are some straits. Tricky to navigate, and if I may say so, tricky to chart.
What do the constellations at the top of the map signify?
Purely a decoration, milord.
I take the constellation that has its zenith over the charted territory.
Every seaman knows them.
Just like the Southern Cross over the Strait of Magellan.
Merely a conceit of mine so that people may recognize my work.
-Quite an original idea. -Thank you, sir.
This figure with the dagger pointing down... -is Orion the Hunter, is it not? -Yes, Your Excellency.
Then Your Excellency has some knowledge of astronomy?
Not as much as I should like to have.
They say that even our fortunes rest with the stars.
You see, gentlemen, the orbit of Orion is approximately this narrow path... between the equator and the 10-degree parallel.
The constellation appears to move overhead as the earth turns on its axis.
Obviously, the section of land you are seeking must be somewhere on this belt.
And from your memory of the chart... it appears this strip is too long to be an island... not large enough to be a continent.
Therefore, we may deduce it is an isthmus.
The only isthmus running east and west under Orion's orbit... is this connecting link between the two continents of the New World.
Gentlemen, here is your charted strip of land... the isthmus of Panama.
Fifty sacks of rice, 50 pounds of raisins, 30 pounds of cocoa... eighteen hogsheads of vinegar, 50 jars of wine--
Thank you, Mr. Pitt.
I have some rather urgent business in London, so you'll take charge.
Isn't that rather a sudden decision, Capt. Thorpe?
No, it's.... Just what are you grinning at, Mr. Pitt?
I couldn't help thinking to myself that if I were going to London... I'd certainly make it a point to see Miss Latham.
-Blast if I wouldn't. -I daresay you would.
As a matter of fact, I have an appointment, only she doesn't know it yet.
-Thank you, gentlemen. -Aye, aye, sir.
Hello, gentlemen.
Is Capt. Thorpe in his cabin?
That he is. He'll be pleased to see you, sir.
This way, sir.
It seems I'm just in time.
-You're looking very fit. -Thank you, sir.
Are you going ashore?
Yes. I was just going to London.
We don't sail until next week, you know.
That's what I came to see you about. You couldn't sail sooner, could you?
Why, yes, if there was some reason for it.
There is, Captain, a very good reason.
I have a message from Her Majesty the Queen.
She'd like you to set sail immediately.
There are certain members of her court that are asking too many questions... about your latest trading expedition up the Nile.
I see.
Very well, Sir John. I'll not go to London.
And will you please inform Her Majesty we sail with tomorrow's tide?
You are feeling very happy, Uncle.
What? Yes.
Have you had good news?
Excellent news.
Is it a secret?
You wouldn't be interested, my dear.
Excuse me. Mr. Kroner to see you, Don Alvarez.
Have him come in, Miss Latham.
-Your Excellency. Doña Maria. -You have news from my lord?
Aye, the best possible news. Capt. Lopez sailed this morning.
He'll get to Panama before Capt. Thorpe.
Please congratulate His Lordship and convey my best wishes.
Thank you, señor. Maria.
The English pirate has plundered his last ship.
Uncle, what will they do to him?
Piracy is punishable with death.
Or, if Spain is disposed to be lenient, there's the galley.
-Martha. -What's wrong, my dear?
-Order me a carriage and fast horses. -My child!
I'm going to Dover.
Yes. I'll order it at once, my dear.
-Can you reach Dover tonight?
-With a change of horses, yes.
As quickly as possible, please.
-Not a word to my uncle.
-Do not worry about that, my dear.
And if you see that big ruffian Carl, give him my felicitations... not that he will know what it means.
Drive on.
3:00 and all's well!
Can I help you, milady?
Is that the Albatross?
Yes, milady. Sailed this evening on the ebb tide.
-ls there anything I can do?
-No, thank you.
Set your course west-southwest.
Capt. Thorpe has arrived, señor. An inlet 10 miles west of Nombre de Dios.
So, for once they send me an accurate report... and on time.
Your orders, General?
You will leave with a small escort for Nombre de Dios... at sundown, as scheduled.
But the English will attack.
And you will offer no resistance.
Capt. Thorpe came a long way for this gold. We must not disappoint him.
Lieutenant, you have seen the jungle orchid?
It is a very attractive flower... that holds out its yellow pollen... but once an insect is lured within its petals... they close like this.
We're on the right track, Captain.
I got it from a native.
They hate the Spanish worse than we do.
Near as I could figure his lingo... the gold train leaves Ventacruz at sundown...
-about 20 mules in all.
-How far is Ventacruz from here?
About 20 miles, Captain.
It'll take a mule train most of the night.
Good. Then we'll have time for some sleep after we set up the ambush.
Spread out along this trail at intervals of 10 yards.
Burke, I'm stationing you at the rear. It's a very responsible position. You'll signal on your whistle when you see the last man and mule pass.
You all know what to do, men.
I'll stay at this point.
Mr. Pitt, you're across from me, Mr. Scott, next place down the line.
Men, you better all pick out your nests before dark.
It's too thick in there.
You can't see what's in it.
Full of snakes and crocodiles, I'll wager.
They say there's plants with arms like that'll strangle a man if he ain't careful.
Stop that talk, or you'll be seeing ghosts before you see Spaniards.
It's a funny thing about sailors, you know?
They don't mind a fight if they can see what they're fighting. But you take a mosquito, now--
What were you saying about mosquitoes?
There's a whole nest of them here.
The beasts have ears.
Try holding your breath, Mr. Pitt, and then they won't trouble you.
-Better?
-No. I'd rather have the Spaniards.
Hold it longer.
Dismount, please.
-Disarm him, Mr. Pitt. -Aye, sir.
Down the line, Scott. See if everything's in our hands.
This is an outrage. It shall be reported to His Majesty King Phillip.
The news may be a little delayed in reaching him... since I must ask you to remain my prisoner.
Under protest, Capt. Thorpe.
-So you know my name.
-Why, yes, señor.
Everyone in Spain knows your name, and respects it.
I'm flattered, but I must warn you against making any false moves... or my men will be forced to shoot you.
-Mount, if you please. -Up.
-Looks like it's come pretty easy, Captain.
-Yes. A little too easy.
-They all disarmed, Scott? -Aye, Captain.
One thing more, sir... if we should happen to meet anyone along this trail... this is your caravan, and we're part of your escort.
Pass the word.
Everything ready to move.
-Ready to move!
-Move up, men.
-Get back. -Behind you!
-Take cover.
-It's a trap and no mistake, sir.
Into the swamp.
Out of the swamps. No one can live in there.
Let's get out of here.
It's too hot.
It's too blooming hot.
They're not following. We can rest here.
Let me see that arm, Tuttle.
It's in me chest, Captain. A bit of musket lead.
We'll get that out when we get back to the ship.
Yes, sir.
How did the Spanish know we were here? That's what I can't fathom.
We'll find out someday.
Wonder if the others got through, Captain?
If they did, they'll head for the ship.
Lads, we'd best be moving.
You'll never get there with me, Captain.
Of course we will, William.
Feel that breeze?
That's from the sea.
-We're on the shore. -The sea!
Stand back.
It's hard news to carry back.
They'll be wondering to see only the one boat coming.
Some of them might get through yet, mightn't they, Captain?
It's a miracle any of us are here, Burke.
I can't see the lookout.
They didn't expect us so soon.
It's funny they haven't posted a lookout.
Maybe there's one behind the chart house.
We couldn't see him from here.
I hope they haven't broken into the ale closet. I could do with a mug, if the chimps ain't drunk it all up.
All I'd like to do is sleep for 1,000 years.
Here's one got ahead of you.
Captain, he ain't never going to wake up.
He wanted to go back to the sea.
-Have you sighted anyone on the boat yet?
-Not a blooming soul.
You might give them a hail, Mr. Scott.
We'll need their help when we get there.
Ahoy, there!
Ahoy, mates! Give us a hand.
You lubbers, show your faces. It's the Captain.
Do you hear me?
What are the fools hiding for?
-I don't like it. Something's wrong.
-No more of that, or I'll have to--
Steady, Mr. Pitt.
Ship your oars.
Make fast.
You stay in the boat, Burke.
Welcome, Capt. Thorpe. I advise you not to resist.
Those muskets are in the hands of excellent marksmen, I assure you.
Besides, Captain, it's my turn to entertain you.
I regret it has to be on your ship, but you will understand the necessity.
If you draw that sword, Captain, we shall not have the pleasure... of taking you and your men back to Spain alive.
Your prisoners, Captain.
"ltem 37:
"You did by sorcery and other heretical practices...
"then try to enter secretly by night the Spanish city of Cartagena...
"and did capture the garrison and force the governor...
"to pay a ransom in the amount of 30,000 ducats.
"ltem 38:
"You did also attack His Majesty's galleass Madre Dolores at Valparaiso...
"and did seize gold in the amount of £8,000...
"thirteen chests of coin silver...
"and 1,770 jars of wine.
"ltem 39:
"You did also loot and sink the galleass Santa Eulàlia del Monte...
"in the English Channel...
"profaning His Majesty in the person of his ambassador.
"ln summary of these offenses, our records show...
"you did plunder seven cities in the empire of Spain...
"and did destroy 47 of His Majesty's vessels."
Capt. Thorpe, do you confess to the truth of these charges?
Your records do us an injustice. They should read nine cities and 54 vessels.
You will amend the charges in accordance with the defendant's statement... and place his confession on record.
Capt. Thorpe it is adjudged... you will be handed over to the military authorities... under whose direction you will be chained to the oars of a galley... in servitude for the rest of your natural lives.
Perhaps we'd better dispense with the "Captain"... under the circumstances.
It isn't often we have the pleasure... of entertaining so famous a pirate in our galley.
I hope you'll find our hospitality all that you anticipated.
No doubt we shall. You Spanish have a gift for hospitality when your guests are in chains.
We're getting under way.
You'll start the oars at 10 beats.
Drop your oars in the water. Now pull, you English mongrels!
Beautiful.
But are all Spanish songs so sad, my child?
Only those that speak of love, Your Grace.
You speak of it eloquently, my dear.
I daresay each of us must choose between loving a man or ruling him.
I prefer to rule.
I don't quarrel with your choice, Maria.
You have your song... and I have my scepter.
Now sing us one that is gay.
Don Alvarez, is your business so urgent... that it must intrude upon my few moments of diversion?
Your Grace, I have just had a communication from Spain... that I feel sure will command your interest.
It concerns the privateer Geoffrey Thorpe.
What about him?
While attempting a raid on the Panama treasure caravan... he was captured by Spanish troops... and is now a condemned prisoner on one of His Majesty's galleys.
My child.
I'm all right, Uncle.
Your pardon, Majesty.
Say no more, my dear. I quite understand.
You may take Maria to her rooms. Stay with her as long as she needs you.
You may go, all of you.
Don Alvarez, it appears your news concerns your niece more than it does me.
Your Grace, I would have spared her had I known.
Your arrow hit the wrong mark.
As for myself... I regret Capt. Thorpe's fate because he is a brave man.
But he is a privateer, and privateers must take their own risks.
Then, Your Grace, I must speak bluntly.
My sovereign is not convinced that Capt. Thorpe risked so much... merely for his own gain.
No? Then perhaps you can suggest a more likely motive.
Your Grace will recall she released Thorpe... after his attack upon my ship... and that on the heels of this offense she allowed the Albatross to sail... presumably to trade in Egypt.
Am I to be held accountable for Capt. Thorpe's change of mind?
Thorpe never intended any project but the one he undertook... although by now he might wish he had.
You weary me with your implications.
Come to the point. I regret that the point is not an agreeable one.
From the circumstances I've mentioned, my sovereign is forced to infer... that Capt. Thorpe had the approval of Your Majesty... in an overt act of war upon the empire of Spain.
Do you question my word?
Unfortunately my government cannot reconcile your words... with the acts of your subjects.
Then let Phillip infer what he pleases.
I will not be held accountable to Phillip for my actions... or for those of my people.
In that case...
I'm instructed to serve official notice upon Your Majesty... that the honor of Spain requires... that you will immediately disband and imprison the Sea Hawks... or face the consequences of an open conflict between our two nations.
What are you saying?
Do you dare come to me with threats?
Out of my court before I order your arrest!
Remove that man's portrait from my sight.
Hurry! Do as I say.
Go to Lord Wolfingham. Tell him to summon my council at once.
It's enough I've had to listen to his tiresome complaints... without having to look at his arrogant face.
"The honor of Spain requires...." Requires, indeed.
Presumptuous fool.
Telling me what I can and can't do... as if the world were a jewel that hung around his neck.
Has Phillip gone completely mad?
Does he think he can dictate to the Queen of England?
Who's to defend us but the Sea Hawks?
Your Majesty, we cannot afford an open break with Spain.
What makes you think we will be attacked?
What other reason has Phillip for building an armada?
But, Your Grace, these demands are preposterous.
These men are loyal and devoted.
In what way have they offended but in serving their country?
Spain seeks to strip you of your one defense upon the seas.
Sir John, we need defense only if we are attacked.
To disregard Phillip's warning is to invite an immediate war.
While to heed it is to throw ourselves at his mercy.
What of that?
He has too many concerns elsewhere to bother about us.
I believe Phillip's thirst for power... can only be quenched in the English Channel.
Even if that were true... are my Lord Admiral and his privateers prepared to stop him?
We are ready to try, my lord... to the last ship and to the last man.
If Phillip is bold enough to make demands now... what will he do when the Armada is built?
My lords, I have considered your opinions earnestly.
My own impulse, like Sir John's, is to defy Phillip. But the safety of my subjects constrains me to caution.
Lord Wolfingham, you will prepare an order... authorizing the arrests of all English privateers... and the confiscation of their ships as they put into port.
That will be all, my lords.
My friend, there are times when a queen must think... not of right or wrong... but only of the good of those she rules.
My child, you mustn't weep so. There may yet be some hope.
What chance is there for a galley slave?
But at least he is still alive, Maria.
Alive like animals in a dark cage.
No air, no sun, no kindness... no mercy.
Only time and torture. The hours as heavy as their chains.
Martha, better he were dead than down there... waiting only to die.
I am sorry.
And what good will that do now?
My child, I only did what I had to do.
What I feel towards you I'll have to feel for the rest of my life.
Maria, you're very young. Time will make you feel differently.
Only one thing will make any difference.
Uncle, if we could go to Spain and plead with the king....
There's no chance?
For any other man, perhaps. Not Capt. Thorpe.
Capt. Mendoza, important dispatch.
I'll see that they reach the Madre de Dios... before she sails from Cádiz.
-On deck.
-Four prisoners assigned to your galley.
We'll put them to good use. Keep them in irons.
Back to your oars. We're getting under way.
Drop your oars in the water!
Cross is dead, Mr. Pitt.
Wake up, you. Pull on that oar. Do you hear me?
I'm tired of your tricks.
He's dead.
I didn't know you at first.
-Yes. Mark your beat.
Sir John sent me to Spain.
I was taken in Madrid.
The Armada, moving against England soon.
Sir John wanted proof to convince the Queen.
But Hawkins, Frobisher, the rest of the Sea Hawks... do they know?
They're all in prison or hiding. By orders from Spain.
The Queen did it to avert war.
The Armada. Did you find the proof?
The papers are aboard this ship, being taken to the Madre de Dios in Cádiz.
They had me before I could get them.
They were informed. The same thing in Panama.
Pitt, pass the word.
Everyone stop when I stop.
-Refuse to start. -Aye, aye, sir.
Stop when the Captain stops.
Stop when you get the word.
The wind has slackened... and we must reach Cádiz before the Madre de Dios sails.
-Can't you raise the beat?
-They can't row above 18 for long, sir.
What time does the Madre de Dios leave Cádiz?
Before morning, that's all I know, and we can't risk missing her.
What's happening?
We're slowing down.
The timekeeper's asleep.
Find out what's wrong.
Pick up the beat!
What are you sitting there for?
Bend over it.
Turn around and row.
Pick up those oars!
Rebel, will you?
Thorpe, this is your work.
When we make Cádiz, I'll have you hung.
Pick up your oars and put your backs to it!
Timekeeper, raise the beat to 18!
-Capt. Ortiz has been expecting you. -Thank you.
Men, you all know what to do.
You men follow me. The rest of you stand guard.
It appears that you and the Madre de Dios... will be paying the last official visit to England.
-The last friendly visit, shall we say?
-Exactly.
I can't say that I envy you your commission... to sail alone into the port of the enemy.
It is my privilege to fetch home the ambassador before we strike. Besides, England isn't an enemy until she knows she is.
True.
Luckily, she'll only know that when the Armada appears in the Channel.
When will that be, Captain?
According to the information I am carrying to Lord Wolfingham... the Armada is almost ready to sail against England.
-Odd.
-What is it?
The breeze must have freshened. We're swinging at anchor.
-Yes, I can feel the drift. -We'd better let you turn in, Captain.
When does the crew come aboard?
They have leave till 4:00. We sail at dawn.
Bon voyage, Capt. Ortiz.
Thank you... but I look forward more eagerly to our next voyage to England.
Gentlemen, I drink to the success of the Armada.
To the Armada.
Into the tops, men. We're getting under way.
Man the helm, Abbott.
Fox, at the foresail!
Matson, up with the main!
Mr. Pitt, the mizzen.
Aloft, there! Clear your leech line.
Clear away your mizzen vangs!
Heave taut your halyard!
Slack away your true lines!
Your passport, please.
Here.
Very good, Your Excellency. Sorry to have stopped you.
We're taking precautions against the privateers, sir.
Drive on.
Maria, there's still time to reconsider. I can hold the boat at Dover while we send for your things.
I've made up my mind. I'm staying here.
But if trouble should come between our country and England... your position here may become very difficult.
I'm as much English as Spanish. Maybe more.
Is that the reason, Maria?
I can't go back to Spain as long as there's any hope. Uncle, let's not talk about it anymore.
I'll be lonely and homesick... but I know I'll be lonely wherever I am.
Up oars!
Now remember, as soon as Don Alvarez comes down... tell him in Spanish you'll take him out to Capt. Ortiz.
What do we do when we get him aboard?
Nothing. Just hold him until further orders.
-How will you get to the Queen?
-I don't know.
Off with you, lads. Quick as you can to the landing.
-Goodbye, Uncle. -Goodbye, Maria.
May you find your happiness.
I'm sorry. I thought you might cry out.
I saw your carriage waiting... and I couldn't help it.
Where did you come from?
How did you get here?
On the ship that came for your uncle.
But you, why aren't you going with him?
He's going to Spain.
And you're staying here? Why?
Don't you know why?
Ever since that day you went away... I've been in torment thinking something might happen to you... and you'd never know.
And then it did happen, and I've never forgiven myself until now.
I love you.
I've loved you ever since that day in the rose garden. Only I kept it to myself then because I was too proud.
I'm not proud anymore.
Only I can't believe I've found you again.
Geoffrey, can't you say something?
I'm sorry. I don't seem to have any words.
There were times in Panama, in the galley... when I would have given my life for one sight of you.
And now you're here, close. I just can't realize it, that's all.
But I am here, and we're together.
Nothing's ever going to separate us again. Not distance, and not pride. Not even a large bouquet of English roses.
Curse this fog. It'll be late before we're in London.
You're still in danger.
That'll be over when I get to the Queen.
They're stopping everybody at London Gate.
Looking for honest English sailors.
Strange, but it never occurs to me I'm Spanish and you're English.
-lt doesn't seem important.
I know nothing about war and politics, but I believe in you... and whatever you do must be right.
Please let me help you.
If I could only get into the castle without being recognized, I could....
I'll let you in my entrance. Miss Latham's waiting to let me in.
But the guards, as soon as I step out--
They'll just think I'm smuggling in my lover. After all, it's the truth.
Your pass?
We passed through earlier taking His Excellency... the Spanish ambassador to Dover. There's only his niece inside.
-Can you identify yourself?
-Yes, of course.
There's something the matter. We're stopping too long.
My lady, I'll have to ask you to identify yourself.
-Certainly.
-They told me outside you were alone.
I'll have to see your papers, too, sir.
I just came in on the Madre de Dios, Officer.
-I wasn't expecting to go to London.
-That's unfortunate, but--
My uncle, Don Alvarez, sent him.
-A special mission.
-I'm sorry, my lady.
My orders are no one goes through this gate without a pass.
Officer, I'm on a special mission for Lord Wolfingham.
Here.
See for yourself.
Very well, then. Sorry to have delayed you.
Drive on.
When we get inside the grounds... drive straight to the guardhouse at the main entrance, and drive fast.
-Don't worry.
In the coach. Officer of the guard! In the coach.
Am I in some danger, Officer?
Your pardon, Doña Maria. I thought--
-What's the trouble, Officer?
-He isn't here. -Where is he? -There must be some mistake, sir.
He was in here when we entered the castle gate.
Doña Maria, where is Capt. Thorpe?
Capt. Thorpe? I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the man who rode with you from Dover to this castle.
By what right do you question me?
Guard, close the door! Drive on.
Officer, I want you to station guards at all entrances leading to the Queen... and order an immediate search of the grounds.
-By whose authority?
-Lord Wolfingham's.
You'll have his written orders soon.
Just one moment, Maria.
Inside, please! Quick, please!
Search every corridor in the palace.
Sergeant, take your men and go through the left wing.
Now, mind you, Capt. Thorpe is not to get to the Queen. Put him under arrest and take him to the North Tower.
These are Lord Wolfingham's orders.
-This way, lads. -The rest of you men, follow me.
-Are you in danger? -Until I see the Queen.
I'll help you. There's a private corridor to the Queen.
Capt. Thorpe, did Carl come back?
Carl always comes back. He's at Dover.
The door's straight ahead. The first corridor to your left.
Delay them as long as you can.
What do you want?
-We have an order to search your rooms. -Search our rooms?
What for? I'm sorry, Miss Latham, but I can't take time to explain. Either you open the door or we break it in.
Break that door in, and the Queen shall hear of it!
The Queen will hear of it if we don't.
Very well. Break it in.
Have you nine lives, Capt. Thorpe?
Surely by now most of them must be used up.
I was expecting you, Captain, but not alone... nor in a Spanish uniform.
You should be wearing it.
Perhaps I shall one day.
You have some dispatches for me?
I have some dispatches for the Queen.
I'm afraid I shall have to ask you not to disturb Her Highness.
That's very thoughtful of you, milord, but I think she'll wish to be disturbed. These dispatches bear the seal of Spain.
You won't be as lucky this time as at Panama.
Stop it. Stop it, I tell you!
Your Majesty.
Lord Wolfingham.
One less enemy of England.
Read these, Your Grace.
Secret dispatches from Phillip to Wolfingham. Proof of their plans to send an armada against England.
Capt. Geoffrey Thorpe.
In recognition of your valiant services, I pronounce you a knight of the realm.
Rise, Sir Geoffrey Thorpe.
Accept by my hand the homage of your country... and the gratitude of its queen.
And now, my loyal subjects, a grave duty confronts us all.
To prepare our nation for a war that none of us wants... least of all your queen.
We have tried by all means in our power to avert this war.
We've no quarrel with the people of Spain or of any other country.
But when the ruthless ambition of a man threatens to engulf the world... it becomes the solemn obligation of all free men... to affirm that the earth belongs not to any one man... but to all men.
And that freedom is the deed and title to the soil on which we exist.
Firm in this faith, we shall now make ready... to meet the great Armada that Phillip sends against us.
To this end, I pledge you ships... ships worthy of our seamen.
A mighty fleet hewn out of the forests of England... a navy foremost in the world... not only in our time... but for generations to come.
To England and the Queen!
Bijou!
We want Bijou!
Let's have Bijou!
I'll show you if she's a lady or if she ain't!
Attention!
What's going on here?
Nothing.
I'm just sitting here, minding my own business.
- Rubio!
- Yes, sir?
- Another fight and I'll close your dive.
- What can I do?
They all fight.
- Where is this girl Bijou?
- She's gone.
Bijou had nothing to do with this.
- Quiet!
Where are you from?
- The Navy.
- There's nothing American in port. - I uh...
I was in the Navy. I see.
I gave this girl a whole lot of money. I wanted her to sing.
She won't come out.
He thinks he buys her so he starts for her dressing room.
Liar!
- See? - Report to the magistrate at 10:00!
- Take him out!
- Come on.
I warned you about Bijou a month ago.
Have her at the magistrate 10:00.
Hey, you!
You too.
Yes, sir.
James Clyde, convicted of disorderly conduct and vagrancy.
To be deported.
Andre Boiler...
Stop that smoking back there.
Disorderly conduct, vagrancy.
Deported.
Luigi Coreo, petty larceny, disorderly conduct, vagrancy.
Deported.
Sasha Menken. Sasha Menken?
- Coming.
- Disorderly conduct, fraud, vagrancy.
Your Honour, the disorderly conduct and fraud, I admit - they're minor offences.
But the vagrancy charge is a tissue of lies! A tissue of lies.
- You have no visual means of support.
- I'm a magician.
- You're a pickpocket, a petty thief.
- Do I say no?
But I am a magician. Look.
You impudent pickpocket!
How dare? Sticks and stones may break my bones, but... goldfish.
May I have my watch now, please?
Certainly, sir.
And it's perfectly dry.
Allow me to put it back.
Your Honour, I rest my case.
All right, all right, you're a magician.
And you're a fair and brilliant official.
Deported.
Get out.
Patrick Edward Finnegan, alias Ned Little.
Disorderly conduct, vagabond.
Deported.
- Hey, Chief, how's chances for a fair trial?
- You're getting one.
Outside.
- Bijou?
- Hey, now, wait a minute.
It's OK to push us tramps around but that lady is playing a lone hand.
She's got to get a square deal, or else I'm gonna start trouble. I'm sorry. I just gotta.
- Bijou! - Bijou!
- Bijou! - Coming!
That's what happened to the farmer's daughter.
- Give me a penny.
- Don't go so far away.
Don't worry, boys. When I settle down, I'll send word to all naval units. - Cable code is "Man overboard".
Good morning...
Curlylocks.
- Three times I had to call you...
- Just a minute.
As you were, Big Boy.
Take him out to be deported.
- You're accused...
- Of inciting a riot, being a public nuisance.
I make rough seas, I set the jungle on fire.
I'm a bad influence.
- So I'm to be...
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.
But we've had half a dozen complaints since you came to that café.
A half-dozen?
Why not 50?
I'm surprised.
You know, handsome, when I stop singing to you and you say, "Mm, darling," then I say, "Mm-mm, goodbye." You don't get drunk and roar and fight.
- It's the judgment of this court...
- The minute Bijou is in trouble, she's out.
To be deported, so the court says.
- You must realise...
- Don't feel sorry for me, Curly.
The next island will be wonderful.
Bijou will sing again and the café will be full.
And may an angel take my place here.
It'll serve you right, Curlylocks.
Gangway, gangway!
When are you coming back, Bijou?
Hey, the governor.
That's the man who's deporting us, huh?
- Who is that?
- Just human backwash, Miss Henderson.
Steerage passengers, report to the doctor.
You're a very lucky girl I'm along.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Remember, this belongs to you.
Of course.
Everything is going to be just dandy.
- Turn around. - There's nothing wrong with me.
- I know.
I just wanna look at the pictures.
- Cute, ain't she?
- Beautiful.
Put on your shirt.
That's all.
Hey, mate.
There's a little lady aboard, name of Bijou.
I want you to give her a break, see?
That's all.
I'm uh... kinda looking out for her.
We'll be known all over the Thousand Islands as Sasha The Great and Company.
With Bijou.
I tell you, it's simple mathematics.
Look what happens. Little Ned does the work and we collect.
There's nothing to the big gorilla.
He can fetch water and props and fan us when it's hot.
- Where was your brain with the judge?
- As you were, Big Boy.
He'll think of me every time he wants to know the time.
- Remember.
- Yes, I know.
This belongs to me.
Strip to the waist.
You see how it is, Doc, I can't take my clothes...
Strip to the waist!
Yes, sir.
Oh, Susie, Susie!
Come on back, honey, come on back to Daddy.
I won't let that doctor hurt you.
Come on, honey! Oh.
I've raised Susie from an egg, Doc.
I've seen some queer riffraff.
Deposit that stuff outside and come back later.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
I bet you Susie's waiting for me out there.
Break it up!
Strip to the waist.
- What do you think you're doing?
- You said to take off my dress.
Well, forget it, never mind.
- My head's full of pigeons and rabbits.
- Are they pink?
Inhale.
Where's nice old Dr Kramer?
Is he dead?
How should I know?
Inhale.
- Do you examine the goats too?
- Inhale, please.
Isn't it a bit early in the morning for Cognac and rabbits and things?
It's a bit soon for impertinence.
Turn around.
The funny thing about rudeness - when I say it, it's impertinence.
- When you say it, it's importance. - You talk too much.
Hold still. Cough.
Inhale. Inhale.
What's the hurry?
The next stop is a week from now.
- Right, but you're holding up a lot of people.
- We're just human junk to you.
But we do come in handy.
Turn around.
- What's your name?
- Bijou.
- Bijou what?
- Just Bijou.
- For my friends.
- Hmph, Bijou!
Yes, Bijou.
Wouldn't you be lonesome if you had no Bijous to kick around?
Bijou, yes, there it is.
- "Deported.
Health A1..."
- All right, I can read.
- Aren't you used to being deported? - I am.
You can get used to anything.
You can get used to the plague but I don't like it. Wait a minute.
I'm no plague. Maybe I haven't been cordial...
- Cordial?
- All right, so I've been rude.
I'm sorry.
- Here, have a drink. - Oh, no.
I've tried that.
And when I try, I try hard.
Well, I prescribe it, it'll do you good.
Better to know what you're doing.
Even if it's wrong.
So long, Doc.
- Health A1?
- Sure, health A1.
- How did it go? Did he treat you rough?
- Just routine.
Good evening, Dr Martin.
May I present you to Miss Henderson?
- How do you do?
- Dr Martin.
She's going to join her father in Boni-Komba. He's the new governor. Boni-Komba...
- Excuse me.
- It's my first trip out here. I'm very excited.
- I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself.
Good night.
Dream a while, scheme a while
And you will find
Happiness, and I guess
All the things you've always wanted
Gee, I like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworths doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day, you know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
And you will find
Happiness and I guess...
More, please.
It's grand!
Oh, you want a performance, huh?
Genius, perform for the lady.
We enjoyed it too.
- I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.
I'll tell her.
Oh, please, do, will you?
Sumatra, out.
Java, out.
Boni-Komba, out.
- Mapping a campaign?
- No, a retreat.
I'm running out of islands.
This isn't a professional visit.
I just wanted to tell you that the young lady up on deck didn't mean to be rude.
Oh, yeah?
Who is the sweet thing?
Her name is Henderson.
Her father happens to be the new governor of Boni-Komba.
I thought you might like to know.
Boni-Komba?
Governor Henderson?
- The new governor.
- She didn't mean to offend you.
If she's the governor's daughter, she couldn't offend me.
- Cause for rejoicing? - Rejoicing?
Doctor, you have lifted the Pacific Ocean right off my neck.
Now I can go back to Boni-Komba.
How about a celebration?
Yes, you come to Tony's café, Seven Sinners in Boni-Komba.
Ho-ho. How frightened Tony will be when he sees me. But then, he'll celebrate!
How about my cabin for a snack?
A snack is food.
So I ran to the end of the world and jumped off and here I am. Mm.
So nice and peaceful here.
I don't blame you for running away.
Are you sure?
When the girl married the man with the money,
- why didn't you make more money? - For what?
So I could buy her back?
Good, I'll tell it that way next time.
- Let me have the story of your life.
- I tell it many different ways.
- Which one would you like to hear?
- Go right ahead.
Well, there's a lovely version about a little girl from a convent in Marseille.
Get out your handkerchief because this is awfully sad.
And a young, dashing officer from Saigon and wedding bells. Ding dong.
He drank like a fish.
He's dead.
Grape juice?
No, thanks.
Wait a minute.
Come up like this every night, will you?
Thanks.
You're a good doctor.
- I might get to like it.
- Then why hurry?
Sleep.
Last night was bad, very bad.
I shall miss you very much.
Sure.
In the evening.
You must have someone to sit around and drink all the grape juice.
- I'll be here waiting.
- Yes, when they throw me out.
When you're tired, I'll still be here.
Oh, my smoking career would get in your nostrils.
That shouldn't make any difference.
Couple of friendly derelicts.
- I'm not quite ready for the word "derelict".
- I'm sorry.
You're the kindest man I've ever met.
Got a penny?
Bye, Doc.
Run aground, miss?
I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, Lieutenant Brent.
- Miss Henderson.
Captain.
- Shall we go?
- Goodbye.
- Your father was sorry he couldn't be here.
- I'm sure he was.
I can tell you this, from your father down to the last guard, the Navy's ready for you.
- Uniforms spick and span, parades.
- Sounds enchanting.
Lieutenant, I shall report you for want of attention. Yeah.
There'll be no lack of attention.
We've been waiting for you too long.
Shove off.
- Hey, Ned.
- Oh. Hello. I got the bags.
Rickshaw?
I've been saving it for you.
- Café Seven Sinners. - Café Seven Sinners.
Gangway!
Gangway, rickshaw!
Rickshaw! Rickshaw, gangway!
Wait here.
I want to talk to Tony alone.
I'll see him, I can sell anything.
Gangway!
Take care of him, Big Boy.
- I can't give you anything but love, baby... - No.
- That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby... - No. No.
- Bijou!
- Yes, I've come back home again.
Bijou is home again.
Please, my heart is not so good.
But you look new.
The place, it looks new and nice.
Yes and it's going to stay new and nice.
Yes. We won't have any more riots.
We're going to keep it that way, huh?
We are going to do nothing.
Bijou, sit down.
No, don't sit down, stand up.
Your boat is going to leave in an hour.
I'll buy you a drink.
Bijou, I love you.
I adore you.
You're wonderful.
But you are too much.
Bring the drinks.
No, thanks.
I'm on the grape-juice wagon.
Antro.
Did it get too hot for you in Sumatra?
Run along, babies, and hurry.
Be gone when I come back up here.
An angel from Lotus Street... in Sumatra.
Yes, my gorgeous one.
But even Sumatra is dull, deadly dull without you.
And this dump?
For 48 hours, I have tried to rip fun out of this place.
Then suddenly, I turn around.
Is this Bijou, Tony?
Or am I too drunk? Hm?
So Bijou is going to sing for you again, Tony?
Good.
It is not yet arranged.
It is now.
Whatever became of that big knife?
Were the police in Sumatra touchy about returning it afterwards?
Or were you shy about claiming it?
The Navy.
See you later, dear Antro.
- The Navy?
- Well, in there is only a little bit of Navy.
What a girl.
She incites me to my teeth and I like it.
I love it, my friend!
I love it!
I beg your pardon?
- May I have an American cigarette?
- Have one of mine.
Thank you.
Bijou Blanche.
- Bijou to the Navy.
- That's us!
Go on with your game.
I'll watch you, if you don't mind.
- Come on... - There's your cue, Judson.
- I got a buck that says he can't make it.
- I got a buck that says he does.
- Any more takers? - There he goes.
That's easy money.
Oh, come on, hit the ball.
Not very good.
Here he goes, boys. Here he goes.
- You wanna make that shot, sailor?
- I sure do.
- All right, I'll help you.
Now, you put your hands on mine.
- Is that what you mean?
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- I see what you mean.
- What are you shaking about, Judson?
- Shut up, will ya?
- Come on. Give the man a chance.
The one ball is blocked, that's too tough.
So we play billiard combination and put the 12 in the right-side pocket.
That's a tough shot.
Easy, easy.
She did it!
- Do you really wanna see a tough one? - Come on, show us.
All right.
- Say, do you know?
- Wait a minute.
Now, the two will go in that corner.
the 14 in there, 15 in that pocket.
Now bet.
- One dollar.
- One dollar. Such easy money.
She made it!
Let that be a lesson - never gamble with strangers.
Hey, they got blackouts here.
You discovered America.
Here, I work for nothing.
- Remember what Bijou said. - Hey!
The flophouse is two doors down below.
This is no place for loafers. Come on! Get outta here!
Get outta here. Go on!
You see, I... You tell me I've got to hire Bijou.
Why don't you tell me to set fire to the place?
It's the same thing.
While the place burns, let's have fun.
I don't want any fun.
Ten minutes ago, I was the boss.
You'll be boss as long as you keep Bijou happy. Here.
- Buy her some dresses, lots of them.
- Wait a minute, bud.
Bijou buys her own dresses.
- Didn't I told you to get outta here?
- I'm your new bouncer.
- I tell you...
What? - Bouncer.
I'm your magician, waiter, juggler and dancer.
Waiter, juggler, dancer, bouncer?
Who told you that?
- Bijou.
- That's enough.
That's enough! That's enough!
You seem to have whipped the Navy into a furious sense of duty.
Mr Judson and Mr Henckel have duty in the morning and wish to say good night. - How splendid.
Did I do that?
- I'll give you the credit.
Uh, we're going to have boxing on board Saturday night.
Would you like that?
- I'd love it.
- Splendid.
- Well, how do you like us?
- You're wonderful.
Oh, by the way, Austin, Wilson, Robbins and uh... oh, yes, Vance, they wanted me to say good night and they had a wonderful time.
- Duty first, Father. - Mm, yes, yes.
Undoubtedly.
Splendid, just splendid.
- Will you pardon us?
- Yes, of course.
- Shall we dance?
- Aren't you going to the Seven Sinners?
- Here she comes!
- Bijou!
See those shoulders broad and glorious
See that smile, that smile's notorious
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy
See those nice blue trousers walk about
That's that salty walk they talk about
Mister, watch your wife
The man's in the Navy
Now, lots of men stand six foot seven
And lots of men have arms like heaven
And lots of men have hair all golden and wavy
But when 10,000 gorgeous women'll
Chase him like some hunted criminal
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy
See those shoulders broad and glorious
See that smile, that smile's notorious
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy...
Well, it's a fine thing.
Officers and gentlemen, by act of Congress.
Where were your manners?
Wouldn't have taken any skin off to stand by for another half-hour.
You left me hanging out on a limb.
Who do you?
Would the lieutenant like to say it from up here?
See those shoulders broad and glorious
See that smile, that smile's notorious
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy
See those nice blue trousers walk about
That's that salty walk they talk about
Mister, watch your wife
The man's in the Navy
Now, lots of men just can't remember
That big romance from last November
And leave the lady cold as yesterday's gravy
But when he says, "I love you, Bessie"
To some poor kid whose name is Jessie
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy
- The first night and you're starting already.
- Yes, isn't it wonderful?
- Just like old times.
- Tomorrow morning, there is a boat sailing.
And you're going to be on it! Shh!
Just like old times!
Oh, Tony, don't let's quarrel tonight, it's too marvellous.
You insulted not only the Navy but one of the executive officers.
- All right. I'll apologise.
- You're not doing anything of the kind.
You're going up to your dressing room and you're going to be very quiet.
I promise to be on my best behaviour.
I'm going to apologise.
No, you're not.
No, Bijou, please!
- Are you looking for me?
- No, I was going...
Come on, sit down. Have a drink.
This is your table.
Sorry, I'm joining the Navy.
You don't want to make a scene here, do you?
No, I don't want to make a scene.
Not for anything in the world.
As you were, as you were.
That tall lieutenant didn't think I was so wonderful.
- His face is a little red...
- He won't be up for air for a month!
- What's your ship, sailor?
- The good ship Seven Sinners.
- Bijou, did anybody ever tell you?
- What?
- I'm sure they have.
- Bijou?
- What is it?
Antro is sitting there at the table, he wants to spend money.
You remember me, I work for a living.
And anyway, I'm in the Navy.
Maestro, give.
- All together, sing.
- We sing?
See those shoulders broad and glorious
See that smile, that smile's notorious
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy
See those nice blue trousers walk about
That's that salty walk they talk about
Better watch your wife the man's in the Navy...
Gangway!
Boy, oh, boy, I'm sure happy.
- We're sure a sensation in this place.
- What do you mean "we"?
- Take it back.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What do you see in that guy?
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
In my great joy, do I know what I'm doing?
Beat it, boys.
See you at the café.
Good morning, Missy Bijou. Good morning.
OK, Charlie, give me the routine over here.
- Missy Bijou, like a little potty?
- Yes, I could use two or three.
Oh, excuse me.
Good morning, Miss Henderson.
Can I do something for you this morning?
- Go ahead, I can wait.
- Take care of the lady, Charlie.
And keep shirty on.
May I say good morning, Lieutenant? Oh...
May you say good morning!
- I've been looking all over town...
- Yes, it's such a big place, isn't it?
- But I still sing at the Seven Sinners.
- I haven't been in since...
I know, I insulted you.
Tony told me.
He gave me a week to make things straight. I've only two days more.
- Tony's wacky.
I'll square him.
- Do you really mean that?
Mean it?
Look deep into my honest blue eyes.
No, grey.
My honest grey eyes.
Can you doubt me?
Missy Henderson, thank you very much.
Thanks an awful lot, Lieutenant.
Homeside. Chop chop.
Missy Bijou, like to buy little potty?
Missy Bijou gotty litty potty.
Haven't you got nothing better to do than stand here in the corner?
Oh. I was reading.
I like to read sometimes, it improves the mind.
Don't break your arm, fella.
Are you in the Navy?
I was once but I missed my ship at Singapore.
That's tough going.
Hello, Tony. Lieutenant, ah, you come back.
I'm so glad you're mad at me.
I mean, I'm so mad, I'm mad at you.
I'm glad you're mad... I'm...
- You know what I'm saying.
- Don't tell me, let me guess.
Come on. Let's have a drink.
- Did I tell her? - Gangway, gangway!
Did I bawl her up?
Well, you shouldn't have.
It was entirely my fault. I know.
Sure, Bijou is only a little bitty baby.
A baby?
Does he laugh by the hour, or is it piecework?
You had a good laugh the other night too, didn't you?
- Don't you like it?
- Don't you go making no passes at a uniform of the United States Navy.
I wouldn't for the world have anything happen to that beautiful uniform.
Don't you forget it. I'm the bouncer here.
Will you go over there and bounce yourself?
See you later, Lieutenant.
He thinks he's a rubber ball.
Greetings, greetings and greetings.
- Hi, Dan.
- These amateurs giving you a show? - Amateurs?
- I saw Tony. - Oh, thank you.
Bijou.
Bijou, he thinks he's good.
Does anyone think I'm not?
- Bijou can take you. - Sure.
Oh, gentlemen, huh?
Letting her win.
- Two bucks says you'll be a gentleman too.
- Two bucks says I'm not.
- Call it for the break.
- Heads.
Will you give me six bits against a half-dollar you're not a gent?
It's a bet.
Laughing boy is here again.
If I bet you are no gentleman, I'm on your side. No?
No.
15 points.
- Two to one - for any amount.
- I don't want to take your money.
- You won't get any.
Bijou and I are a tough team to beat.
Shanghai, Bali, Sumatra.
We were never a team
- Shanghai, Bali, Sumatra or any other place.
- About this game or anything else.
- The blushing, sweet-scented flower.
Is that a package you're selling?
Look, Pollyanna...
- You'll excuse us?
- Take your time.
After you.
With pleasure.
You know, you're old enough, there's some things you ought to be told.
Uh, I don't think that climate in there agrees with you.
As a matter of fact, I've been worried about your health altogether lately.
You don't look well.
It's just a little dizzy spell.
Every time I look at you, I see eight or nine of you.
- I'll be all right when I can only see one.
- That can be arranged too.
Careful of the uniform, Lieutenant.
Won't anybody give you a light?
- Our hero!
We were mighty worried about you, Lieutenant.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Go ahead.
I usually do my own fighting but thanks anyway.
Got a penny?
Sure.
It's uh... an English penny, but... but it brought me a lot of luck.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
You've heard songs and singers too
But there's nothing really new
In the way these singers sing today
Now I've a song that cannot miss
But you must remember this
To sing this song, you must be ooey-scray
You've heard folks go boo-boo-be-do, boo-boo-be-dooby-do, boo-boo-be-do
But you ain't heard folks go dig-a-dag-a-phut
And you've heard folks go vo-do-ee-oh, vo-do-ee-oh-de-oh, vo-do-ee-oh
But you ain't heard folks go dig-a-dag-a-phut
Now, to sing this song, you must be gifted...
Just a minute.
And when you get your tongue all twisted, just go
Come in.
- Oh, hello. - Oh, hello.
I went hiking today and...
These are wild flowers.
- I see.
- For you.
You got me picking wild orchids.
That's a new low.
- Have you never done it before?
- No, never.
When I saw these and they made me think of you or...
Or rather, I was thinking of you.
Thinking of what?
- Is there something I could do with?
- Yes, I'll take them.
Now, where were we?
- You were thinking. - Oh, yes.
What were you thinking of?
Well, if you keep looking at me like that, I'm liable to tell you.
What?
Oh, that admiral's coat.
Where did you?
Can't you do something about it?
- What's that? - Oh, that?
Uh, nothing.
look, if I get you something else, will you wear it?
Yes.
Come in.
Oh, hello.
I uh... was just on my way to the ship.
The short cut through my dressing room.
I uh... went hiking today.
Oh, you did?
Don't tell me, you were picking wild flowers?
Yes.
- Not uh... orchids?
- Yes.
- What was that?
- Oh, the blackout.
- You look handsome, Judson.
- Gosh, it's dark.
The blackout's a success.
Heaven help a working girl on a night like this.
That admiral's coat fooled me for a minute.
Now, don't be frightened, darling, it's not Brent.
Don't be nervous, I'm here.
I won't.
I hope you girls don't think I'm intruding?
The lights went out all over town.
- Well, it's a blackout.
- They ought to notify people about...
Find Sasha and bring him here now.
- I'm sorry, boys, this is serious.
- Well, go on.
Gangway! Gangway!
Come on. Take it easy.
What's the matter?
- Hand it over.
- Don't know what you mean.
- I do.
You got a basket? - A basket?
What are you doing? Wait!
That ain't fair. Oh!
Honestly, I don't know how it happened.
I was working away...
For once I'm going to make you laugh at each other.
I will make horrible examples of careless people.
Anyhow, if you have to lose things, why don't you lose something I would like?
- Ensign James Scott. - Hey.
Stand up.
Is this your pocketbook?
Gangway!
- Why, yes.
- How much money is there in it?
- Only seven dollars.
- The family wealth.
That's very careless.
Now, this I would know anywhere.
Mr Antro.
Next time there's a blackout, you'd better get under the table.
I'm surprised, such a smart man.
Now, who's this?
Edward Patrick Finnegan.
Edward Patrick Finnegan, speak up, come on!
- But it's you. - Edward Pa...
Now, let's see.
Who here knows Helen in Singapore?
Myrtle in Manila, Honorée in Borneo.
Oh, it's you.
Kid Romeo.
Agnes in Tokyo and Mabel in Hong Kong.
A ladykiller!
And Becky in Barcelona.
And Ruth in Trinidad.
Ruth?
Why, you!
Lightfingers, you're getting your very last warning.
I told you I like it here.
It ain't the junk I want.
The lights out. One, two, three, the lights on and nobody knows what happened.
- I ain't no thief, I'm an artiste. - Ned.
His lights will go out and they won't come on quick.
He has my permission.
Now, good night.
- I might resign.
- You heard the lady.
Good night!
Hello.
I uh... was just hanging around to say good night.
- Good night.
- I haven't said it yet.
- What?
- Good night.
Well?
Good night.
No. Not yet.
Oh, I must. Because at this time of the night, I have no sense.
Is that a fact?
What?
No sense, this time of night?
No sense at all.
Look me in the eye and swear to that.
I swear.
Tony is here, sir. - Oh.
Come in, Tony. Come in.
- Sit down, Tony. - Yes, I...
I'm not tired. I...
Tony, there's something I want you to do for me.
If I can do it.
Bijou is on the list of entertainers on board ship for the officers' party. - Yes.
Lieutenant Brent, he's the one...
- I'm not asking how it happened.
I don't want to make official business of this thing.
- She's very popular. The boys like her.
- Yes, she's all right.
But uh... there are some reasons why it might be as well if she didn't appear.
Can't you take care of this thing and leave me out of it?
Well, when Bijou makes up her mind, you know, it's very hard to change it.
- You're her boss, aren't you? - Yes, I'm her boss...
Yes, I'm her boss.
Don't worry, I'll fix it.
Well, I'm very grateful, Tony.
It's a little bit awkward.
You don't have to worry about awkward because when I tell Bijou who is the boss, she knows that I'm the boss and I'm going...
Yes, she could be a little awkward.
Well, try to make her understand, Tony, that the Navy has enough destroyers.
What's your hurry?
Did I tell you to hurry?
I want to register a complaint.
I think you are making a mistake, devoting so much time to the Navy.
I see what you mean.
Supposing I were to tell you I'm in love?
It would be a pity.
I'd have to get rid of that gentleman.
Never mind.
Run along and have a good time.
- Don't let me spoil your fun.
- Chop chop.
Chop chop.
- Admiral! Tell fortune!
- Not today.
Tell fortune, Admiral!
Wait a minute.
Listen, listen, listen.
Your fortune, sailor?
I got my fortune.
Got it for a penny, remember?
- I'm a little late.
- A little late?
I've been waiting for nine years.
Flowers for Bijou.
We're casting a funny shadow.
Excuse me.
Look, Junior, are you by any chance following me?
- No, I ain't.
- Fine. Then it's the lady you're following.
You'd like to meet her? Is that it?
Junior, this is Bijou.
Bijou, this is Junior.
Scram.
- Flowers for Bijou.
- Thank you.
Flowers for Bijou.
Same table?
Imagine finding you here.
I'm the type of girl you're liable to find anywhere.
Flowers for Bijou.
Not me.
Excuse me.
- What's so funny?
- The kid gave you the flowers.
Junior, you sure see things from a funny angle, don't you?
How does it look from there?
Oh, Dan, I wish you hadn't done that.
I'm scared.
You mean Antro?
Don't let those professional house-haunters scare you.
I've seen Antro haunt before.
He never misses.
Now, look, I'm going to do something I've never done in my life.
I'm going to leave an island before I'm chucked off.
Wait a minute.
You're running away to save me.
- I'm always running. What difference why?
- Nothing doing.
- I'm sorry.
- You've got to stay.
Them's orders.
I'm not joking, sailor.
I've played out my string here.
I'd better move on.
Then, I mean...
I mean, my welfare means that much?
Just what a sailor usually means to a girl.
Well, you can't go.
You know the penalty for desertion.
- Desertion?
- Yes. You promised to sing aboard ship.
And I promised the officers.
And a gentleman always keeps his word.
And a sailor.
And a sailor's girl.
Doesn't make any kind of sense... but I'll never desert the Navy.
Bijou, what are you doing?
Whatever you say, I wouldn't believe it.
Antro is screaming, there's crowds there.
You're late.
Tonight is Navy night, all aboard.
Bijou, I forbid you to go on board that ship!
That was the day before yesterday.
Go to the ship.
They'll show you a room where we'll dress.
Take the piano player.
You don't take no piano player and you leave the dressing rooms...
Bijou, Antro is waiting with a crowd of knives.
Er... with a bunch of people.
I'll take care of Antro.
You wouldn't want Bijou to miss this party, would you?
I forbid it.
I am the boss.
Honest to goodness, I'm the boss.
Something must have gone wrong.
I'm sorry.
See, I bringed you Bijou.
- We've been waiting.
- If I'd only known before.
- But now you'll have to excuse me.
- Sit down.
I would love to but first, I'll have to tell the Navy that Mr Antro must be entertained.
That's a great idea.
Tell them in a letter.
Champagne.
Sasha is wonderful, ain't he?
- Sasha is very clever.
- Very.
Once I heard he turned a streetcar into a side street...
Look!
Straight from the barnyard.
Who's laughing?
I've been in love before
It's true
Been learning to adore just you
Some old romance taught me how to kiss
To smile like that
And sigh like this
I've been in love before
You see
Oh, darling, what a bore
I'd be
A heart that's lived a bit
Can tell when it beats true
I've been in love before
Haven't you?
- Congratulations, Dan.
- Swell show.
And I do like that kind of a band.
- Uh... shall we dance? - What can we lose?
Beg your pardon.
May I cut in?
Your song was swell.
Wonderful.
And so are... are you.
It's been a good many years since I've done any dancing.
Getting too old for that sort of thing.
I getting so I get out of breath playing checkers.
But I do like to see the young folks have a good time.
Excuse me a moment.
- Thank you, sir.
- Excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
May I cut in?
Certainly.
Beg your pardon, sir, the captain would like to see you at once.
Yes, sir?
I want you to see to it that that woman leaves the ship at once.
- Orders, sir?
- Orders.
Aye aye, sir.
- Someday, those people will drive me...
- Darling, it's all my fault.
- Your fault? - Yes.
I shouldn't have come up again.
But I wanted to dance with you and I don't regret it.
- Well, if you don't, I guess...
- I'm awfully glad you're mad.
- Well, in that case...
- No, no, you have to go back to the boat.
- But wait a minute.
- It's your job.
But hurry.
- A welcoming committee.
- Sure.
Antro is waiting.
Always, Antro is waiting.
Tonight, in Tony's, waiting and drinking.
And thinking, "If I stay here much longer, I'll be too drunk to welcome Bijou."
Looking for this?
It's no good.
It's empty.
Get out.
Imagine Antro too drunk to be nice to Bijou after the Navy kicks her out.
Bijou entertains the Navy and they kick her out.
If she would entertain Antro...
Maybe that's the trouble.
I'm too nice to you.
You are too beautiful.
I should choke you.
See that?
That's the trouble.
You make Antro sentimental.
Come in.
Uh... it was stuck. It was.
Oh, Tony says you gotta come back to work right away or you'll be fired.
That's all right, we were leaving anyway.
Did you speak to the lieutenant about me?
- No, not yet.
I will tomorrow.
- Oh, good.
- I'm sorry, Mr Antro.
- That's all right.
- You sent for me, sir?
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- This Bijou gal.
It's developing into something else.
- I'll admit nothing of the kind, sir.
- Everybody knows. For two weeks...
Everybody's a liar.
With all due respect, sir, you have no right...
- Of course I haven't any right.
- Don't condemn her without knowing her.
- We're shoving off soon.
- Shoving off?
Yes. It'll give you a chance to think things over.
Well... I've thought things over.
I'll be married before we sail.
Married?
It's a disgrace, you're in the Navy!
- It's my own personal, private business.
- Brent, I know all about these things.
- It doesn't work, it never works.
- Is that all, sir?
No.
I must ask you to remain on board until we shove off.
Orders, sir?
I wish you would.
Thank you, sir.
- Miss Bijou, sir.
- Come in, please.
- Would you be seated?
- Thank you.
Nice of you to come so promptly.
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.
We've learned from Lieutenant Brent that he intends to marry you.
Marry me?
Dan said that?
You were deported from here, let me see, nearly three years ago.
You've been deported from several islands, always for the same reasons.
Inciting a riot, questionable character. This is part of our records.
And he wants to marry you.
- He wants to marry me.
- It's preposterous!
I know Brent's family well.
His father was an admiral.
His grandfather was an admiral and they're proud of that.
I trust I've made myself clear?
You understand?
Yes. Oh, yes, I do understand.
You're a wonderful governor. Thank you so much.
I don't know how to thank you.
At exactly 5:43 and a half, I have an announcement to make.
The governor just told me I'm going to be married.
That's wonderful! That's marvellous!
Nothing is too good for you.
Nothing is good enough for you!
Nothing is half good enough for you.
- Hey, you're not going to marry me?
- No, Tony.
I'll be Mrs Lieutenant Dan Brent.
Where's Little Ned?
The super-stupid is having a hearing on a battleship.
I have an idea and it's hot.
The time to strike is when the iron is hot.
That's marvellous! That's wonderful!
Look, your first wedding present.
- But they're real.
- Would I give you anything phoney?
Uh, look, don't wear them right away.
Give them a little time to cool off.
I'll tell you what you'll do. Return them just as cleverly as you took them.
- And I'll never talk about it again.
- All right, I'll return them.
But I resent the implication. Shoreside.
Chop chop.
Well, you did it.
Why? I was just aboard.
What a mess you made out of that ship.
Looks like a submarine smacked it. If you want a riot, stay where you belong.
- Why, Ned. - The lieutenant's talking of resigning.
And for you.
He had a great career and you stopped him right in his tracks!
Shut up!
- What are you trying to make outta him?
- Take your hands off me and get out!
Shut up, you're off your nut.
He'd kill you inside of six months.
You've got no right to be an officer's wife!
You fool!
You don't know what you're talking about!
When he thinks of all the years he's been in the Navy and all he's worked for has gone by the board, he's gonna hate your insides.
You can't get the Navy out of your heart and your blood, honest you can't.
If he didn't kill you, you'd do it yourself.
You couldn't take it.
And you wouldn't want to hurt anybody, especially a guy like him.
It's cuckoo. That's...
It's just cuckoo.
Everything is rosy.
I returned the pearls and nobody...
The Malacca's in.
It sails tomorrow.
Get three tickets.
Make it two.
On board, they said I might get back in the Navy.
Make it two.
- The lieutenant will come to the café. - No!
I could see him once more.
Even the Navy couldn't resent if I saw him once more.
I'd better get down to the café and pack, before he comes.
Yes, I'll pack.
He mustn't know until after I've gone.
Aw, leave the poor dame alone. She's made up her mind.
Hold this.
Bijou, honeymoons is wonderful but not when business is wonderful.
And business is wonderful and you're wonderful.
Watch where you're...
When somebody sends anybody some flowers, somebody must like anybody.
That's why this...
White, just like yours.
You go and find Dan. Don't let him come in.
Hit him if you have to but stop him.
- I can't hit him, I want to be in the Navy.
- Do anything but stop him.
OK.
The Navy song, boys.
See those shoulders broad and glorious
See that smile, that smile's notorious
You can bet your life the man's in the Navy
See those nice blue trousers walk about...
Lieutenant? Lieutenant.
- You can't go in there, Lieutenant.
- I what?
- You can't go in.
She told me. - Why not?
- You'll get in trouble. - Trouble?
- You will get in trouble, Antro is in there.
- Oh, he is? Well, that's for me.
Please, Lieutenant.
Chase him like some hunted criminal
You can bet your life...
Look, Antro, no uniform.
Uh-oh, I got one of your dizzy spells.
Stop the fight! Stop the fight!
Gangway!
- How do we know who to hit?
- Any guy in a white coat.
Blue, like yours.
Hey, Lieutenant, where are you?
Listen, you big bully, you can't do this to me.
Lieutenant, where are you?
Over here, sailor!
Stick with them, Lieutenant.
Here comes baby!
- Welcome aboard.
- I'm happy to be aboard.
- I'm going to get Antro.
- Get to getting.
Nice one, Lieutenant!
- Watch out for the knife. - I'm watching!
Look out!
Get upstairs!
- Thought I told you to stay outta here.
- That's right, you did.
Not a bad first round!
Not so tough.
Bijou, you've got to get out of here.
If they catch you, they will deport you.
What difference does it make if they deport me?
- Bijou, who's the boss?
- You're the boss.
Sometimes, it's good to be the boss.
Now, you lie still.
I'll be back.
I'm the boss.
- Is he all right?
- He's all right, just knocked out.
Get him out. It's the police. Get him out!
OK.
- What will I tell 'em?
- Anything. The truth, everything.
But get him out of here.
I should've recognised you before, Antro.
- You report to the magistrate... - Yes.
To the magistrate tomorrow.
For inciting a riot, questionable character.
To be deported.
Hey, you.
You too.
Yes, sir.
With your mind at rest, are you thoroughly reconciled and ready to go back to work?
Yes, sir.
By some miracle, you have escaped the consequences.
But the Navy can neither countenance nor condone such rowdy behaviour.
You will be restricted to the ship until further orders.
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh and, Brent.
- Yes, sir?
It might interest you to know that Mr Antro has two broken ribs, a broken collarbone and can't eat a bite.
- Is that all, sir?
- Isn't that enough?
Yes, sir.
Attention!
And salute.
Well, fellas, I hardly know what to...
Well... what are you saving that button for?
- Button it up, or cut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Trim that cap. - Aye aye, sir.
What is this?
A bunch of Camp Fire Girls? Suck that in!
Well, what are you waiting for?
- Break it up.
- Aye aye, sir.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Yes. Oh, Finnegan.
- I have permission to speak to the officer.
- You're looking good.
It's thanks to you, sir.
May I have half-hour's leave, sir?
Sure.
While you're there, give her my, uh...
I'll deliver your message, sir.
Steerage passengers, report to the doctor.
- The lieutenant got me a year's probation.
- I'm awfully glad.
He said to say goodbye and everything.
I'm going to miss this.
Looking for islands, Doc.
- Any new governors?
- Health A1?
Yes, health A1.
Hey, wait a minute.
She won't be needing you.
Give this back to the doctor.
Penny, lady? A penny?
You're a good pal, aren't you, Doc?
What do you think?
Then how's about buying a pal a drink?
- 'Morning, Mr. Pirovitch.
- Good morning.
- Always the first one.
- It's none of your business.
Let me tell you, it doesn't hurt to be too early.
What for and why?
Who sees you? Me.
And who sees me?
What does it get us?
Can we give each other a raise? No.
What are you doing with that bicycle? You can't take it.
Better not let Mr. Matuschek see.
Why don't you tell him? It's all right with me.
You know where I was last night while you were home soaking your feet?
"Pepi, go to the dressmaker." And when I come back:
"Pepi, will you please pick up a package at the drugstore?" - Good morning.
- How's your boy? - Much better, thanks.
- We called Dr. Hegedus.
- He's a very expensive doctor.
What can you do?
I thought I'd cut down on my cigars for a few weeks. - Good morning.
- That's a new silver fox! It's stunning! - Thank you.
- It must have been pretty expensive.
- It was.
I hesitated a long time before I bought it.
I said, "No, I can't afford it." Still, I couldn't take my eyes off it.
- I said, "No, I have no right to..."
- And then he said, "Go on and take it."
- Trying to be clever. - Shut up.
Good morning.
Pepi, go to the drugstore and get me a bicarbonate of soda.
- What's the matter? - Do you feel well?
It's all right.
- Good morning, good morning.
- Want to hear a joke? - No.
What's the matter, folks?
Not awake yet? Look at me.
I bet I haven't slept half as much as you.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, to tell you the truth I had quite a time last night.
We don't want to hear the poor girl's name.
- Kralik, how was the dinner last night?
- Oh, yes, that's right.
Kralik had dinner with the boss last night.
Tell us all about it.
- Are you a partner now, Mr. Kralik?
- Don't be funny.
How was it?
It was a very nice evening, and I enjoyed myself.
- I bet the food was good. - You can imagine.
Tell me, is it true Mrs. Matuschek had her face lifted?
How could I know that?
- How old did she look to you last night?
- Well, 40.
She had her face lifted.
I think Mrs. Matuschek is a very charming woman.
- Who said she isn't?
- Don't try to make something out of it. I didn't say Mrs. Matuschek is not charming. But I said she is.
What's wrong with that?
So the food was good?
Seven courses, not including the hors d'oeuvres.
- Were you sitting next to her? - I was.
What do you think of that?
- I bet you were brilliant.
- No, I kept still and tried to learn.
- Your bicarbonate, Mr. Kralik. - Thanks, Pepi.
- Bicarbonate?
- I had a little too much goose liver.
What's the matter?
Wasn't it any good?
Now, look here, vadas. Just a minute.
Folks, come over.
Did you hear... I want you to hear this.
Did I make any derogatory remark about the goose liver? - No, not any!
I merely said that I had too much goose liver.
- "A little too much goose liver." - That's right.
"A little too much goose liver." Not one word more, and not one less.
- Good morning, Mr. Matuschek. - Yes, good morning.
Who put this 32.50 suitcase in the window?
I did, Mr. Matuschek.
- I guess it's all right. - Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
Go across the street to the drugstore, and get me some bicarbonate of soda. Yes, sir.
Allow me, Mr. Matuschek.
May I help?
There we are, Mr. Matuschek.
Want to hear something nice? - Yes.
What is it?
A letter from a girl.
"My heart was trembling as I walked into the post office...
"...and there you were, lying in box 237.
"I took you out of your envelope and read you... "...read you right there... "...oh, my dear friend."
- What is all this?
- You see, I wanted to buy an encyclopedia. Encyclopedia?
What're you talking about?
You come to a time in your life when you get tired of going to cafés dance halls every night, and you want to improve yourself.
You want to study something about art literature and history, how people live in Brazil.
Tell me what has all this to do with the letter?
You know I can't afford a new encyclopedia so I was looking through the ads in the paper and I got on the wrong page, and I came across this ad, and...
Wait a minute, I have it right here.
Here, read that.
"Modern girl wishes to correspond on cultural subjects... "...anonymously with intelligent, sympathetic, young man.
"Address: Dear Friend, Post Office 15, Box 237." I know those ads.
The papers are full of them.
- How long has this been going on?
- We've exchanged four letters. - Four letters?
- And she's no ordinary girl.
"Are you tall? Are you short?
"Are your eyes blue? Are they brown?
Don't tell me. "What does it matter so long as our minds meet?"
- That's beautiful.
- It is, isn't it? Now, wait a minute.
"We have enough troubles in our daily lives.
"There are so many great and beautiful things... "...to discuss in this world of ours...
"...it would be wasting precious moments... "...if we told each other the vulgar details... "...of how we earn our daily bread, so don't let's do it."
I can buy two dozen of these cigarette boxes at Miklos Brothers. What do you think of it?
I think it's great.
Well, open it.
No, Mr. Matuschek, it's not for us.
But you haven't listened to it.
It plays Ochi Tchornya.
Even if it played Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, I'd still say no.
I just don't like the idea.
It's wonderful how you make up your mind so quickly.
I've been in this business for 35 years. It took me a whole hour to decide that I like this box.
But, of course, you're a genius.
You know so much more than I. - Mr. vadas.
- Coming, Mr. Matuschek. - Miss Novotni.
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek?
Look here, what do you think of this?
I want your honest opinion.
Don't let me influence you.
All I want is your honest opinion.
I think people who smoke cigarettes and love to hear Ochi Tchornya will like it.
I'd even go further.
I think it'll make music lovers out of smokers and smokers out of music lovers.
It's sensational! Yes, well.
Mr. Kralik, have you thought it over? Yes.
I still think it's inadvisable.
Well, give me one reason.
Let's say that a man smokes 20 cigarettes a day. That means that 20 times a day he opens this box and 20 times a day he has to listen to Ochi Tchornya.
It's a perfectly terrible idea.
It's imitation leather, the glue's no good in two weeks it will fall apart, and all you'll have is Ochi Tchornya.
You don't have to tell me that it's imitation leather. I know that.
You sell things and let me do the buying. - Excuse me, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes?
Miklos Brothers is calling about the cigarette box.
Can I call you back in about five minutes?
I'd like a little more time to think about it.
No, no, it's not the price. It's just that I'm not quite sure about the whole idea.
You can't expect me to make up my mind in five minutes!
If that's the case, then I'll have to say no.
I'm sorry.
- A lovely bag, don't you think?
It's an imported model. We have it in pigskin, several different colors and with or without fitted accessories.
- I really didn't come in to buy a bag.
What can I show you?
To tell you the truth, I really didn't come in to buy anything.
That's perfectly all right.
If you wish to look around, make yourself at home. Yes, thank you.
I wonder if I could see Mr. Matuschek.
Unfortunately, Mr. Matuschek is quite busy at the moment.
- I could call him if you wanted.
- I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
If you tell me your wishes, it's possible I could take care of them.
I noticed in your shop window that you're having a summer sale.
Yes, everything in the shop is marked down 25 percent some articles even more.
Take for instance this compact. Yesterday you couldn't get it for a penny less than 3.90.
Now it's 2.25.
- Yes, that's a wonderful bargain.
- Everything in the shop is a bargain today.
Yes, I imagine you'll be doing big business.
I have no doubt of it. You were very wise to come early.
It'll be such a rush, we won't be able to help the customers.
- Maybe you should take on extra help.
- We probably will.
Maybe you could use me. I'm looking for a job.
That wasn't very nice, letting me go through the whole routine.
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to.
Could you help me get a job here?
I'd like to, but there's no opening.
But you just told me you'd need some extra people because of the rush.
Look around for yourself. You can see what kind of business we're doing.
I beg your pardon.
How much is that belt in the window, the one that says 2.95?
- 2.95. - Oh, no.
- May I tell you my qualifications?
- Lf I could do anything for you, I'd do it.
I'm not inexperienced.
I know the situation, and there's no chance.
I worked for two years at Blasek and Company and 10 months at Latzki Brothers.
Even if you'd worked at Mintz and Kramer...
I did! I took care of the finest clientele.
We don't deal with that class here. We have middle-class trade.
What trade do you think they have?
They'd take me back now.
- Why don't you go back?
- That's another story.
If it was up to me, I'd put you to work. But I'm not the boss.
- Then why don't you let me see him?
- He's in sort of a bad mood today.
I'll take a chance. Maybe I can cheer him up.
Young lady, I've been here for nine years, and I know Mr. Matuschek inside out.
I can predict his every reaction. I could tell you word for word exactly what he'd say.
Mr. Kralik, I beg your pardon.
Just one moment, please. It's all right.
So, you know every reaction of mine? You know me inside out?
You know what I think, even before I thought of it.
You're not only a genius, you're a mind reader. - Mr. Matuschek...
Good morning, madam.
I am Mr. Matuschek. - Good morning, Mr. Matuschek.
I don't know what the difficulty is but I can assure you, that the word "impossible" is not in the vocabulary of Matuschek and Company.
- I am so happy to hear you say that. - I mean it.
I was at Blasek and Company... Oh, madam.
I'm sure you'll find much nicer things in my shop.
No, I mean, I worked there.
I'm looking for a job.
No, no, that's impossible. It's out of the question.
- But... - I have no time. I'm very busy.
I'm very sorry.
I'm afraid you're just wasting your time.
But I've got to have a job.
- Just a moment, Mr. Matuschek.
- Have you tried Baum's Department Store?
- Every entrance.
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe after inventory.
- When will that be?
- In a week or so.
- Just a minute, Mr. Matuschek.
Please, may I leave my address?
If we need anybody, you'll be the first.
My name is Klara Novak, Duna Street, 42.
And if you need me in a hurry, you can phone 246-422.
It's the grocery store downstairs.
Ask for Johanna, and tell her you have a message for Klara.
- Close the door.
Why did you put me in that situation in front of the whole shop?
I'm very sorry, sir, but it was not my fault.
- Whose fault was it? Mine? - Yes.
What's the matter with you, Kralik?
You're my oldest employee.
I do everything I can to show my appreciation. I ask you to my house.
- I'm very grateful, sir.
- You have a funny way of showing it.
You know how much I value your judgment and on every occasion you contradict me. Whatever I say, you say, "no."
From now on, I say, "yes." Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
Certainly, Mr. Matuschek. Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
- That was a nice party last night. - Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
- Yes, I had a lot of fun, didn't you?
- Yes.
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself so much.
That little poem that you wrote in Mrs. Matuschek's guest book did you make that up yourself?
It's sort of half and half.
- How do you mean?
- Half Shakespeare and half me.
I just changed the lines around to suit the occasion.
I made that last line rhyme with Matuschek, that's all.
- Mrs. Matuschek liked it very much. - Thank you.
You made a fine impression on her.
Mrs. Matuschek thinks a lot of you. And you know, I think a lot of Mrs. Matuschek.
I've found a customer for the cigarette box.
What price shall I quote?
Well, let me see. It costs us 2.85, and I think we get five percent...
Let me take care of this, Mr. Matuschek.
Look, there's no use waiting now. Believe me.
If there's an opening, you'll be the first. Just a moment.
Tell me, would you buy a box like this?
Mr. Matuschek, I couldn't buy anything at the moment.
No, I want your opinion.
Now, don't let me influence you.
I just want your opinion.
Do you like this box? Yes, I do.
I think it's lovely. Yes.
Why? Why?
I think it's romantic.
What's romantic about it?
Well, cigarettes and music, I don't know.
It makes me think of moonlight and cigarettes and music.
- There's the woman's point of view.
- Yes, Miss...
Novak.
- How much are you selling it for?
- Let me see. 4.25. 4.25?
Yes, 4.25.
That's a bargain!
Good morning, madam.
It's a lovely box, isn't it? Oh, yes.
It's a candy box, isn't it?
Yes, madam, a candy box, and I should say, a very unusual one.
May I open it for you?
Yes, madam. That's Ochi Tchornya.
It's a very popular classic. No, that would never do.
Where do people get ideas like that?
Imagine, every time you take a piece of candy you have to listen to that song.
I couldn't buy a thing like that.
Too silly.
I know just what you mean, madam.
Yet some customers like it for the very thing you object to.
We've sold quite a few. - Really?
- Yes, madam.
There's no denying that we all have a weakness for candy.
I don't mean to say anything against candy.
No, I only mean that sometimes we are inclined to overdo it a little. I suppose so.
Madam, have you any idea how many pieces of candy you eat a day?
No, I never gave it a thought.
We pick up a piece of candy absent-mindedly and then we take another piece. Before we know it, we've gained a few pounds.
That's when our troubles begin.
Massages, electric cabinets.
I know it.
Now, this little box makes you candy-conscious.
That's what we designed it for.
Every time you open it, the little tinkling song is a message to you.
"Too much candy, now be careful."
How much is it?
It's 5.50, reduced from 6.95. It's a real bargain.
- I'll take it. - Thank you, madam.
What do you say now?
I think people who like to smoke candy and listen to cigarettes will love it.
Don't let me influence you.
I want your opinion, your honest opinion, that's all I want.
I've got a big dinner date tonight.
- With the boss?
- No, he never invites me anymore.
How do you figure him out, anyway?
I give up. It's certainly very difficult to get along with him these days.
He never talks to me anymore.
I hope he's feeling more cheerful today. He better, because I'm going to ask him for a raise.
A raise?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? - No, go ahead.
- It's confidential. Yes, sure.
Suppose that a fellow like me wants to get married.
That's wonderful!
That's the best thing that could happen.
Who's the girl?
Wait a minute.
What did I say? I said, "suppose." I said, "a fellow like me." I didn't say me.
How much does it cost you to live, you and Mrs. Pirovitch?
- Leaving out the children. - Why fool yourself?
Well, let's say temporarily. How much does it cost?
- It can be done.
- Yeah? Yes, and very nicely.
Naturally, you can't be extravagant.
Suppose a fellow gets an apartment with three rooms.
Dining room, bedroom, living room.
What do you need three rooms for?
You live in the bedroom.
- Where do you eat?
- In the kitchen.
You get a nice big kitchen.
Where do you entertain?
What are you, an ambassador?
Who do you want to entertain?
If someone is really your friend, he comes after dinner.
- Good morning, Miss Novak. - How's your wife, Mr. Pirovitch?
I forgot to call Dr. Hegedus.
- Something serious with your wife?
- No, she couldn't be better.
- Why do you want to call him?
- Lf I don't, he'll come.
Excuse me, I'd better telephone him.
I hope it isn't too late.
Miss Novak? Yes, Mr. Kralik?
I noticed that you wore a yellow blouse with light-green dots yesterday.
No, Mr. Kralik. As usual, you're mistaken.
It was green with light-yellow dots. Everybody else thought it was very becoming.
I don't remember remarking about your neckties.
If you think I couldn't say anything about your neckties just ask Mr. vadas.
My blouse is none of your business. I'm sorry.
Mr. Matuschek seems to think it is my business.
Yes, that's right. I'm working under you.
I'll call you every morning and describe what I'm going to wear.
Before I select my next wardrobe, my dressmaker will give you samples.
- Imagine you dictating what I should wear.
- I don't care what you wear.
For a circus pony, it's all right.
I have my own troubles without your blouse between Matuschek and me.
I sold as much yesterday as anybody else. For a rainy Monday three weeks before Christmas, 95.50 isn't bad.
- Did you tell Mr. Matuschek that? - Yes.
And what did he say?
"Not to come in that blouse."
- Tell him I won't. - I will!
I caught him in time. Saves me five pengo, and that counts when you're married.
- Is this tie all right to wear to work?
- Quite all right. Tell me, who is the girl?
Well, you know that girl I was corresponding with?
- Yes, about the cultural subjects.
Well, after a while, we got on the subject of love naturally on a very cultural level.
What else can you do in a letter?
She is the most wonderful girl in the world.
Is she pretty?
She has such ideals and such a viewpoint on things that she's so far above the girls you meet today, there's no comparison.
- So she is not so very pretty?
- Don't say that. I'm sorry.
The main thing is that you like her.
- Yeah, I hope I will.
- What do you mean?
You love a girl, and you don't know if you like her?
Well, that's just the question. I haven't met her yet. - What?
You haven't met her yet? - No.
I keep postponing it and postponing it.
I'm scared.
This girl thinks I'm the most wonderful person in the world. And after all, there is a chance she might be disappointed.
Yes, there is a chance.
- You might be disappointed, too.
And I don't dare think about it.
Pirovitch, did you ever get a bonus?
Yes, once.
Yeah, the boss hands you the envelope.
You wonder how much is in it, and you don't want to open it.
As long as the envelope's closed, you're a millionaire.
You keep postponing that moment and you can't postpone it forever.
I'm meeting her tonight, 8:30 in a café.
- A red carnation? - Yeah.
She's using one for a bookmark in a copy of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
I'm wearing one in my lapel.
I haven't slept for days.
I'm sure she'll be beautiful.
Not too beautiful.
What chance would a fellow like me...
- What do you want, a homely girl? - No.
You knock on wood for me.
Just a lovely, average girl.
That's all I want.
Thank you, my good man.
'Morning, everybody.
Here, keep the change.
Send your boy through college.
Thank you, sir.
I see by the expression on your underpaid faces you wonder where I get money.
No, Mr. vadas, I don't wonder.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I don't wonder.
This window looks terrible.
There isn't a shop on the street that doesn't look better.
It's a wonder we get any customers.
We'll stay tonight after closing hours and redecorate it.
- I'll have to get out of it some way.
- Klara, you haven't got a chance.
I have an engagement tonight at 8:30.
I have to go home first. I have to change.
Ilona, did you notice the blouse I wore yesterday, the green one?
With the light yellow dots?
I thought it was simply stunning.
I'm so glad.
I'm planning to wear it tonight.
Yeah, hello, darling.
Well, you were sleeping, and I didn't want to disturb you.
You came home late last night.
I thought perhaps you'd like to sleep a little longer.
No, I'm not angry. Did you have a good time?
That's all that matters, isn't it?
What?
1,000 pengo?
But, Emma, I don't understand it.
Only last Monday I gave you...
No, I'm not complaining.
It's quite a bit of money.
Yeah, all right.
I'll send it over as soon as possible. Yeah, goodbye.
- What is it?
- I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
- Is it important?
- It's important to me.
Is it important to Matuschek and Company?
Not exactly, sir.
Well, then, I'm sorry. I'm busy.
You'll have to see me later.
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it now?
Sir, for several days your attitude toward me seems to have changed. - Has it?
- Yes, Mr. Matuschek, it has.
Really, I'm completely at a loss to understand it.
After all, I do my work.
And you get paid for it? Yes, sir.
- Every month? - Yes, sir.
Yes, everything seems to be all right then, doesn't it?
Did you see him?
I'm not going to stand for this much longer.
What does that man want of me?
Why does he always pick on me?
- You are his oldest employee.
- That's a fine reason.
He picks on me, too.
The other day he called me an idiot.
What could I do?
I said, "Yes, Mr. Matuschek, I'm an idiot."
I'm no fool.
Listen, maybe he has business worries. Or maybe he has some trouble with his wife.
Is that true, Pirovitch?
Is he having trouble with his wife?
I don't know, it's none of my business.
I'm talking to Kralik.
What do you want?
I don't know anything.
Kralik, don't be impulsive, not at a time like this.
Not when millions of people are out of work.
- I can get a job anywhere. - Can you?
Let's be honest.
I'll take a chance.
I'm no coward, you know.
I'm not afraid. - I am.
I have a family.
- Well, I haven't.
Think it over.
Those were nice letters, weren't they?
Mr. Kralik, do you think I'll have to work tonight?
After all, I'm a child.
- No, you don't have to stay.
- Do you mean it?
- I'll straighten it out. - Thanks, Mr. Kralik!
- May I help you? - No, thank you.
I put all the imported bags over there on the shelf.
Is that how you wanted it?
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me if there's anything wrong.
Since when have you become interested in my opinions?
I want to please you, Mr. Kralik. I'm working under you.
- You don't have to keep harping on that.
- No, I didn't mean it that way at all.
Regardless of what I think of you I believe that anybody who works with you and doesn't get a great deal out of it, is just plain dumb.
Just what do you mean?
What do you think of me personally?
I mean, since you ask no matter what anybody else says, I think you're a gentleman.
I try to be.
You have no idea what that means to a working girl. What a girl goes through in some shops.
Take for instance when I was with Foeldes Brothers Sons.
The sons were all right, but the brothers, Mr. Kralik...
That's why I like it here so much.
When you say, "Miss Novak, let's go in the back to put bags on the shelf" you really want to put some bags on the shelf.
And that's my idea of gentleman.
I just don't believe in mixing bags with pleasure.
- Yes, Miss Novak? - About that blouse...
- I'm sorry, but I had to do that.
- I want to thank you. I'm glad you did it.
After thinking it all over, you're so right.
- That blouse was awful.
- Oh, no, not awful.
It was. I wouldn't admit it at the time, but what woman would?
We hate to admit we are wrong.
That's why we are so feminine.
This is the first time you've shown a little sense.
- Quite a change in you, Miss Novak.
- I know it, Mr. Kralik.
If you keep this up, we'll get along much better.
- Thank you, Mr. Kralik.
- That's quite all right, Miss Novak.
I was planning to wear that awful blouse tonight. - I have a date with...
- Tonight?
Didn't you hear what Mr. Matuschek said? We have to stay and decorate the windows.
- I almost forgot. - Yes.
Would it be possible, do you think you could spare me tonight?
And then maybe Mr. Matuschek would let me off.
So that's why I'm a gentleman. That's why you've learned from me now?
- I don't understand.
- You want the night off?
- I have to, Mr. Kralik.
- You're out of luck.
That was such an obvious trick. I almost fell for it, too.
I have to get off tonight.
It's terribly important.
For the last six months, you've just antagonized me and...
You haven't been very nice to me either.
Whatever I do, it's wrong. If I wrap a package, it's not right.
If I make a suggestion, and some of them are very good... - Here.
Everything has to be done exactly your way, and then you don't like it.
When I first came into this shop, I was full of life and enthusiasm and now I'm nothing.
You've taken my personality away.
You're a dictator, that's what you are.
Mr. Kralik, any day now I may be in a position where I don't have to work anymore. Then I'll really tell you what I think.
As for that blouse, I think it's beautiful, and I'm going to wear it tonight.
Mr. Kralik, I don't like you.
Mr. Matuschek, may I speak to you for a moment?
What is it?
Do you think you could spare me tonight?
Let me see, we need three people, to dress the "A" window.
Can you get along without Miss Novak tonight?
Mr. Matuschek, I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
- You want to go, too?
- Yes, I'd appreciate it very much...
What is this? Does everybody want to leave?
Is this the interest you show?
- Once a year, I ask you to stay.
- I'm sorry, if I'd only known yesterday.
You want a special invitation. Next time, I'll send you an engraved announcement.
I have talked everything over with Mr. Kralik. I know his ideas.
Miss Novotni and I can manage the novelty window by ourselves.
Did I ask you for your advice?
What do you mean you talked this over?
Who's shop is this? Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
So you want the evening off, Mr. Kralik?
That's all right.
I think we can manage.
This is the first time in years I have asked a favor.
I gave you the evening. What more do you want?
- Do you want a brass band?
- You're being unjust.
I'm being unjust?
Once a year, I ask six ladies and gentlemen six, mind you, when next door, a shop twice as big as mine employs only four.
Good morning, madam.
Is there something I can show you?
Have you any traveling bags for men with a zipper?
We have all types of traveling bags for men with zippers.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing some window-shopping for my husband.
- He'll be here tomorrow.
- I'll be delighted to serve him, madam.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
Six people who stand around here for days telling jokes and talking about the movies, while I pay the gas and the rent and the light, and the taxes, and their salaries.
Good morning, Matuschek and Company.
What?
Just a moment.
Mr. Pirovitch.
Mama, I called you.
We are decorating the window after closing hours so we won't have to have dinner with the Laszlos. Isn't that wonderful? Yes, I knew you'd be glad.
Goodbye, Mama.
Six people I ask, one day a year, to be so kind as to redecorate a window.
And you have the nerve, Mr. Kralik the oldest employee in the place, who should set an example.
You spoke like this to me yesterday.
What did I do then?
The whole week you've treated me like this, and without any reason.
Without any reason?
Maybe I have more reason than you think.
It's obvious that you're not satisfied with me.
You can draw your own conclusions.
In that case, I think there's just one thing to do.
Perhaps we'd better call it a day.
Yes, Mrs. Matuschek, he's here.
Mrs. Matuschek on the telephone.
No, I'm not coming home tonight. All right.
All right, I'll send it right over.
Put 1,000 pengo in an envelope and have Pepi take it to Mrs. Matuschek.
Pepi is out.
He has quite a few deliveries, and he won't be back until after lunch.
Mr. Kralik and I always have lunch at Farago's. It's only a few blocks from your home.
We can deliver it. Right, Mr. Kralik?
No, thank you, Mr. Kralik.
I don't like to break in on your lunch hour.
It's perfectly all right.
It'll be a pleasure.
Mr. Kralik will you come to my office. I'd like to talk to you. Yes, sir.
Mr. Kralik I've been thinking all day about what you said this morning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Matuschek.
I'm afraid I lost my temper.
No, I think you were right.
I really believe that you'd be happier somewhere else.
Do you think so, sir?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
I guess there's nothing more to be said. No.
Let me see. You're naturally entitled to a month's pay.
That's 200 pengo.
- That's right, isn't it? - Yes, sir.
Will you, please, sign this receipt.
And here's a letter which certainly won't handicap you in seeking employment.
Thank you, sir.
I guess we might as well say goodbye.
Well?
What happened?
"To whom it may concern: "I wish to state that Mr. Alfred Kralik leaves my employ of his own accord.
"Mr. Kralik started with Matuschek and Company nine years ago as an apprentice.
"With diligence, he advanced to the position of clerk.
"For the last five years, he has been our first salesman.
"We have found him reliable, efficient, resourceful.
"We can recommend him without reserve.
"He carries with him our best wishes for his success in his future career.
Kralik, I still can't believe it.
There's no reason.
The boss doesn't have to give you a reason.
That's one of the wonderful things about being boss.
Well, I wanted to get off tonight. I got off all right.
- Kralik, you're not going?
- No, I couldn't face her tonight.
This morning I had a position, a future.
I'm afraid I sort of exaggerated in my letters.
I showed off a little, and she's expecting to meet a pretty important man.
I'm in no mood to act important tonight.
My dear Kralik, I think I speak for all of us, when I say this is a shock and a surprise.
We all feel we are losing a splendid fellow worker and we certainly wish you the luck which you so rightfully deserve.
Now, Kralik, we are going to see each other soon.
If you have an evening with nothing to do, you know where we live.
- All right, Pirovitch. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Kralik.
Ilona, I'm going to miss you.
I don't understand.
It's nothing unusual. It happens every day. Somebody gets fired and...
Flora, you'll notice when you look through my sales book I cancelled slip number five, but I deducted it from the total.
If I had anything to do with you not getting the evening off, I'm sorry.
It's my fault that you got into this trouble.
Believe me, I'm sorry, too.
That's all right.
- It's true we didn't get along. - No. I guess we fought a lot, but losing a job at a time like this is something you don't wish...
- On your worst enemy.
- I didn't say that, Mr. Kralik.
- Let's not quarrel anymore. - Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Kralik.
Oh, you have.
How soon can you come over here?
Yes, well, come right away. I'll... Right.
I'll be waiting here.
You may all go home. We'll finish the windows tomorrow.
- Excuse me. Good night.
- Good night.
Hello.
Is this Mrs. Hojas?
This is Mr. Pirovitch, Mr. Kralik's friend.
Yes, I know he isn't there yet.
Will you, please, tell him when he comes that we are not working tonight, and I am coming over. Yes.
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Matuschek.
He probably feels pretty low tonight, and I thought...
You don't have to explain. What you do after working hours is your own business.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't changed your mind, by any chance, Mr. Matuschek?
You've got the evening off, haven't you?
Well, go home.
He is the best man you had. Why did you let him go?
I warn you, Mr. Pirovitch.
His whole life he lived in this shop.
He was almost like a son to you.
And you were so proud of him.
You invited him to your home again and again.
Mr. Pirovitch, you want to keep your job, don't you?
Yes, Mr. Matuschek. I have a family. Two children.
In that case, mind your own business and go home.
I beg your pardon.
I'm not quite certain if I delivered Mrs. Matuschek's message.
She told me to remind you to call her if you don't work tonight.
Yes, you told me, vadas.
Mr. Matuschek, the last time I had the pleasure to be at your apartment was several months ago when you sent me after your briefcase.
Today I had a chance to get a glimpse of your new dining room set.
It's exquisite, really.
I can imagine what it'll look like with all the lights on at a dinner party.
- It must be simply stunning.
- Thank you, vadas.
- So it's true?
- I'm afraid so, Mr. Matuschek.
Here we have a complete record from our operatives two of our most reliable men. "Report on Mrs. Emma Matuschek.
"On December 6, Mrs. Matuschek left her residence on vales Street, 23... "...at 8:45 p.m.
"She walked two blocks up to Karto Street where she engaged a taxi.
"At 9:03, the taxi stopped at the corner of Trantor and Bralter Streets.
"There, Mrs. Matuschek was joined by a young man."
Mr. Matuschek, your suspicion was right.
It was one of your employees.
Both our operatives identified him later as Mr. vadas.
Ferencz vadas. Danube Place, 56.
There is such a man in your employ, isn't there?
Twenty-two years we've been married.
Twenty-two years I was proud of my wife.
Well, she just didn't want to grow old with me.
If you'll send me your bill, I'll take care of it immediately.
No, Mrs. Matuschek. This is Miss Kaczek speaking.
Good evening.
Who? Pepi?
No, Pepi isn't back yet.
I see, Mrs. Matuschek.
He did some errands for you.
Oh, you don't say!
He forgot to pick up a bottle of perfume at Chabot's?
Isn't that too bad!
Yes, I'll give a good scolding to the little rascal.
Have a good time, Mrs. Matuschek. Good night.
Don't do that! - Go away! Go away!
No, Mr. Matuschek!
Why don't you go in, Kralik?
I really think you should go in and keep your date.
Now, Pirovitch, just do me a favor and deliver my note.
All right.
Pirovitch, I don't want to know what she looks like.
If she's bad looking, I've had enough bad news for today.
If she's lovely, it'll be more difficult, so don't tell me.
No, I won't. Now, what's the name of that book?
- Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy.
- Anna Karenina. - And a red carnation as a bookmark.
- Red carnation. Now, let me see.
Just a minute.
- Do you see anything? - Not yet.
- There's a beautiful girl!
- Really?
- very beautiful, but no book.
- No book.
- Wait a minute. I think I see it. - Yeah?
Right here under the window.
Yes. - "Anna Karenina by Tolstoy."
- That's right.
And a carnation.
I can't see her face. She's sitting behind a clothes rack.
- There's a cup of coffee on the table. - Yeah?
She's taking a piece of cake.
Kralik, she is dunking.
- Why shouldn't she dunk? - All right.
She is leaning forward now. She...
- Can you see her?
- Is she pretty?
- very pretty.
I should say she looks... She has a little of the coloring of Klara.
Klara?
What, Miss Novak of the shop?
Now, Kralik, you must admit Klara's a very good-looking girl.
Personally, I've always found her a very likeable girl.
This is a fine time to talk about Miss Novak. Now...
If you don't like Miss Novak, I can tell you, you won't like that girl.
- Why?
- Because it is Miss Novak.
Now shall I give the note to the waiter? - No.
What do you want to do, let the poor girl wait?
Why shouldn't Miss Novak wait?
For the last six months she's fought with me every day.
But still, she wrote those letters, my friend.
My misfortune.
- Excuse me, miss, could I have this chair?
- Oh, no! No, you can't! I'm expecting somebody.
He should be here any minute.
That's all right. That's...
Carnation, huh?
A few nights ago we had a case with roses.
Turned out very nice, very nice.
But once, about three months ago, we had a very sad case with gardenias.
She waited all evening and nobody came.
And when we cleaned the café, underneath one of the tables we found another gardenia.
Imagine, the man must've come in taken one look at her, said, "Phooey," and threw away his gardenia.
Is your clock a little fast?
My own says 8:27 and yours says 8:31.
Listen, you have nothing to worry about, a pretty girl like you.
If he doesn't come, I'll put on a carnation myself. - Waiter.
It's quite a coincidence.
I had an appointment here, too.
- You haven't seen Mr. Pirovitch by chance?
Well, I think I'll wait.
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do. You know, I have an appointment, too, Mr. Kralik.
Oh, yes, I remember. Yes.
- My, your friend seems to be a little late.
- And I'll thank you not to be sarcastic.
I know you've had a bad day, and you feel very bitter.
- Still, that's no reason... - Bitter?
About leaving Matuschek and Company?
When I got home and sat at the phone in five minutes I had what amounts to two offers.
I congratulate you.
I wish you good luck.
I see you're reading Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
Yes, do you mind?
No, no, I just didn't expect to meet you in a café with Tolstoy, that's all.
It's quite a surprise. I didn't know you cared for high literature.
There are many things you don't know about me, Mr. Kralik.
Have you read Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky?
- No, I haven't.
- I have.
There are many things you don't know about me, Miss Novak.
As a matter of fact there might be a lot we don't know about each other.
People seldom go to the trouble of scratching the surface of things to find the inner truth.
I really wouldn't care to scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik because I know exactly what I'd find.
Instead of a heart, a handbag. Instead of a soul, a suitcase. And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter which doesn't work.
That's very nicely put.
Yes. Comparing my intellect with a cigarette lighter that doesn't work.
Yeah, that's a very interesting mixture of poetry and meanness.
Let me... Don't misunderstand me.
I'm only trying to pay you a compliment.
Mr. Kralik, please!
I told you I was expecting somebody.
Look, if your party doesn't show up, would I...
Don't worry about that.
My party will show up. So you don't have to entertain me.
- Have you read Zola's Madame Bovary?
- Madame Bovary is not by Zola.
Mr. Kralik, are you still here?
Are you deliberately trying to spoil my evening?
Why do you want to do me harm? Why do you hate me so?
- I don't.
- I suppose you love me.
Why should I? What've you done to make me love you?
- I don't want you to love me.
- I don't!
Do you know what that tune reminds me of?
Yes, thank you. Two dozen unsold cigarette boxes.
It reminds me of a girl out of a job. - A very nice girl, too, I thought.
- You thought that.
How you can lie!
But that was before you started to make fun of me and giving imitations of me in the locker room.
And I'd like to take this opportunity, Miss Novak to inform you that I don't walk like a duck and I'm not bowlegged.
- Aren't you? - No, I'm not.
Well, I have information to the contrary.
Mr. vadas assured me that you have your trousers specially made.
That's a lie!
- So that's the kind of a man you trust.
- No! I've never been to a tailor in my life.
If you think I'm bowlegged, I'll pull up my trousers.
Would you like it if made remarks about your red hands?
- That's what you did.
- After you started making fun of my legs.
My hands aren't red at all!
No, after I called your attention to them.
Let me tell you something, Miss Novak. You may have beautiful thoughts, but you hide them.
As far as your actions, you're cold and snippy like an old maid.
You'll have a tough time getting a man to fall in love with you.
An old maid?
So, no man could fall in love with me?
Mr. Kralik, you're getting funnier every minute.
I could show you letters that would open your eyes.
No, you probably wouldn't understand what's in them.
They're written by a type of man so far superior to you it isn't even funny.
I have to laugh when I think of you calling me an old maid.
You little insignificant clerk.
Doctor, I would say it's a nervous breakdown.
What do you think?
It appears to be an acute epileptoid manifestation and a pan phobic melancholiac with indication of a neurasthenia cordus.
Is that more expensive than a nervous breakdown?
Pardon me, Mr. Katona.
Precisely what position do you hold with Matuschek and Company?
I would describe myself as a contact man. I keep contact between Matuschek and the customers on a bicycle.
Do you mean, an errand boy?
Doctor, did I call you a pill-peddler?
- Hello, Mr. Kralik. - How is he?
I want to thank you for your splendid reaction to my call.
- Is it serious?
- It was a terrible shock.
I have to get over it.
This thing must be kept in strict confidence between the three of us.
Me, Mr. Matuschek, and you. Here.
Thank you for coming, Kralik.
Sit down.
Do you remember the last time you came to my house for dinner?
I said that if things go well, I might take it easier and maybe by Christmas make you manager of the shop.
Now I have to take it easier.
Would you care to work for me again?
No, don't even think about it, sir.
Is it possible that I ever distrusted you?
I hated you.
I couldn't stand your presence any more.
That's how far jealousy can drive a man.
But that's all over now, sir.
When I first got that anonymous letter, I laughed.
My wife having secret rendezvous with one of my employees.
My wife!
But how could you suspect me, sir?
You see, you were the only one of my employees who had been to my home and you sent my wife flowers...
- But that was... You don't have to tell me. When that poison gets into a man's mind...
- Just try to understand.
- I do understand, sir.
Here are the keys to Matuschek and Company.
Thank you, sir.
What shall I do about Mr... vadas?
I want him dismissed as quietly as possible.
No scandal.
Don't even mention the subject to him.
We won't lower ourselves.
This will be the biggest Christmas in the history of Matuschek and Company.
- I know it will. - Yes, sir. Goodbye.
Now that you're the boss, if you want to give yourself a raise...
I'll talk it over with myself, and if I don't want too much money I'll give it to myself.
Thank you, sir!
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!
Pepi, I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.
Don't mention it. It was a pleasure.
If you want anything else, you know where to reach me.
I'm still nothing but an errand boy at Matuschek and Company.
In other words, you'd like to be a clerk?
I wouldn't put it that brutally.
- When I get feeling better...
- But then you might change your mind.
Who knows how long you'll have to stay here.
You're a pretty sick man, Mr. Matuschek. This isn't just an ordinary breakdown.
All right, you're a clerk.
Now, get out of here!
Thanks, Mr. Matuschek!
Kralik, I think I speak for all of us when I say heartiest congratulations.
What a load off my mind.
Now we're all one little happy family again.
Be assured of my cooperation to the fullest extent.
I want you to be a great success.
From now on, you're going to the office, aren't you?
If anybody deserves it, it's you, my boy.
Nice little ring, isn't it?
I had a little luck last night, too.
Real diamond.
My grandma gave it to me.
That's what you get when you're a good boy. Some get apples, I get diamonds. - Good one?
- Yeah. By the way, I have some unusual ideas for that window display.
Thank you, vadas. The rest of us can take care of the windows.
Right now, I'd like you to go into the stockroom and you know those big suitcases on the top shelf?
- The black ones?
- That's right, and the big brown suitcases.
- On the bottom shelf? - On the bottom.
I want you to take all the big black suitcases from the top shelf and move them to the bottom, and the big brown ones from the bottom shelf and move them to the top shelf.
- You don't want to do it?
- I didn't say that.
Of course I'll do it. - I'm a good soldier.
- All right, do it right away.
312-683, please.
Is this the Atlas Employment Agency?
This is Mr. Katona of Matuschek and Company speaking.
We have an opening for a new errand boy. Now see here. I want a educated, healthy boy, good family and no bad habits.
Send me four or five. I'll look them over.
Right away, if you please.
Tell them to ask for Mr. Katona, the sales department.
All right.
What's the matter, didn't you ever see a clerk before?
- Who made you a clerk?
- Yes, who did this dreadful thing?
I can't give you the whole story.
I'm tied up with my word of honor.
If it hadn't been for me, this place would be closed on account of suicide and you'd all be out of a job.
Matuschek and Company, good morning. Yes, Mrs. Matuschek.
Don't miss this, folks.
Yes, this is Pepi speaking.
That's right.
I didn't bring you that bottle of perfume?
Well, you're never going to get it!
What do you think of that?
Your perfume days are over, Mrs. M!
Yes! This is Pepi speaking.
You want to speak to Mr. Matuschek?
That's too bad.
At the moment he's up in a balloon with two blondes.
Now watch this.
You wouldn't like to speak by any chance to Mr. vadas?
That got her. Draw your own conclusions.
You sent for me, chief?
vadas, I'm a little worried about you.
Will you be comfortable under a former, fellow clerk? Working under a younger man?
Kralik, this is the age of youth, and I always ride with the times.
You're a smart young man and my hat's off to you.
Let's stop beating around the bush.
You and I never got along. - You really think so?
- Admit it. You don't like me.
I don't?
Wait a minute, Kralik.
You are the boss.
That's right, but I'm not going to be a "yes" man. You know what I'll do?
I'm going to contradict you.
I do like you!
- Anything else bothering you?
- Yes. I don't like you.
That's every man's privilege.
I thank you for being so frank.
Now I know my problem, and it's up to me to change your mind.
I don't think it'll be so hard.
I heard the funniest joke. Do you want to hear it? No!
Yes, this is Matuschek and Company.
Johanna?
You're calling for Miss Novak.
What's the matter with her?
I hope it's nothing serious.
Fine, I'm glad to hear that.
Tell her not to worry.
Unless she's absolutely all right, tell her not to come today.
No, there's no hurry now.
Tell her to be sure and take good care of herself. All right.
- Really, Kralik, that's a wonderful attitude.
- What's so wonderful about it?
I've been around, and I have my eyes open.
If anyone didn't agree with you here, it was Miss Novak.
Just leave Miss Novak out of this.
Don't misunderstand.
I have nothing against Miss Novak. On the contrary, she's a nice girl.
Only sometimes, she went too far.
Not another word about Miss Novak.
She's a fine girl and a hard worker and she's a good salesgirl, and you shut up!
You misunderstand me.
I didn't mean any offense. - I was agreeing with you.
- I don't want you to agree with me!
You're fired.
You're fired.
Get out of here, you two-faced, double-crossing two-timer!
Go on.
Get out of here!
Did you hear what he called me?
Remember it on the witness stand.
He called me a double-crossing two-timer!
I told you to get out of here! Get out!
Don't you push. Don't you push!
What right have you got to fire me?
Does Mr. Matuschek know?
No!
Mr. Matuschek doesn't know anything about this. I'm the manager, and you don't work here anymore!
How do I know you're the manager?
Prove it to me in black and white.
You're going to get it in black and blue.
All right!
Nice little case of assault and battery.
You'll hear from my lawyer.
What about my salary?
Get the man's salary.
- Here it is, Mr. vadas.
- We have everything prepared.
- We don't want to waste any time.
- Pardon me, sir. Your garments.
I'm entitled to a letter of reference.
I forgot it.
Flora, take a letter.
To whom it may concern:
Mr. vadas has been in the employ of Matuschek and Company for two years during which time he's been efficient as a stool pigeon, a troublemaker, and a rat.
If he doesn't clear out, he'll get a punch in the nose.
Truly, Alfred Kralik, Manager of Matuschek and Company.
I suppose you're surprised to see me back.
Naturally. I'm glad you have your job back again.
I congratulate you.
I hear you haven't been feeling well.
That's all right, thank you.
I wanted to see Mr. Matuschek.
Here he is.
I'm Mr. Matuschek.
Mr. Kralik, don't make any jokes.
Not today.
Please, if you want to pick on me, do it some other time.
I don't know what to say.
I'm trying to tell you that Mr. Matuschek isn't here, and that I'm the manager.
Haven't you got any heart at all?
I'm not well, I can hardly see straight.
Everything is just going round and round.
I ask you a simple question and instead of any consideration, you try to frighten me.
Excuse me.
Mr. Foeldes? Hello, Mr. Foeldes.
Yes. Well, thank you very much.
Yes, it all happened this morning.
That's right, Mr. Foeldes.
No, Mr. Matuschek won't be with us for a while.
Now, please, Mr. Foeldes.
I don't own the shop yet.
I'm only the manager.
- Good evening, Mr. Kralik. I hope you'll forgive this intrusion, but I...
Being in charge of the shop, I feel like a father to our little family.
Anyway, how are you, young lady?
I'll be all right, Mr. Kralik.
Please sit down.
Christmas is coming, and we'll miss a good worker like you in the shop.
So you better get well.
I'll be all right in a day or two.
That doesn't mean that you should neglect yourself.
I'm very serious about this because I feel responsible for the whole thing.
- You?
- Yes.
Oh, no, Mr. Kralik. I think I can relieve your mind.
It wasn't your fault at all.
No, there's a much bigger reason, unfortunately.
Shouldn't you call a doctor?
No, I don't need to see a doctor.
My trouble is what one might call psychological.
It's my own personal problem, and I'll come out of it.
I'm sorry. It's a shame you have to go through all this.
As long as it's only psychological, you won't...
Only psychological!
Mr. Kralik, it's true we're in the same room but we're not on the same planet.
Miss Novak, although I'm the victim of your remark I can't help but admire the exquisite way you have of expressing yourself.
You certainly know how to put a man in his planet.
Aunt Anna has something for you!
She has? Why doesn't she come in?
This is Mr. Kralik of Matuschek and Company.
- I'm glad to meet you.
- How do you do? - I hope it's good news.
- I'll tell you later.
Mr. Kralik, it was kind of you to drop in. I don't want to spoil your whole evening.
I have nothing to do.
Go ahead and read the letter.
Don't worry about me.
- Lf you don't mind.
- Good news?
- very good news.
I can promise you I'll be back in the shop tomorrow, and I'll be on my toes!
I'll sell more goods than ever before.
That's quite a change in you.
It's amazing what one letter can do.
If I weren't feeling so happy, I'd be very annoyed with you.
With me?
Why?
Why? Because you spoiled my date last night.
I wasn't so wrong when I asked you not to sit at my table.
This gentleman did come to the café. He looked in the window, saw us together, and misunderstood.
- He thought you and I were friends?
"Tell me and be frank.
I think you owe it to me.
"Who is this very attractive young man?
He's just the type women fall for."
- I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
- It's all right.
I'll straighten it out. It won't hurt him to be a little jealous.
He doesn't seem to be much of a man, this friend of yours.
I mean, he walks away.
He's afraid to come over to the table when another man is there.
No, Mr. Kralik, he's wasn't afraid, I can assure you.
He's tactful.
He's sensitive.
He's not the type of man who would walk up to a table uninvited.
It's difficult to explain a man like him to a man like you.
Where you would say, "black," he would say, "white."
Where you would say, "ugly," he says, "beautiful."
And when you say, "old maid," he says:
"Eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery...
"vivacious.
"Fascinating."
I remind him of gypsy music.
Speaking of gypsy music, we've had a lot of trouble selling those Ochi Tchornya boxes, haven't we?
- That doesn't make any difference.
- You can consider one box sold.
Yes. I've just had an inspiration. I'll give one to my friend for Christmas.
Miss Novak, you're taking an awful chance.
Why don't you give him a wallet?
I'm sure he'd be crazy about it. Any man would be.
A wallet is practical. Besides, we have those imported pigskins.
- I'm not interested.
- I'd make you a special price.
No, I'm sorry.
Besides being a practical thing a wallet is quite romantic.
On one side he has your last letter, on the other side, a picture of you.
When he opens it, there you are.
And that's all the music he wants.
Why, Mr. Kralik, you surprise me.
That's very well-expressed.
I must admit, that's very nice.
No, just the same, I'm going to give him a cigarette box.
There's not much more I can say.
Except that I wish both of you a Merry Christmas.
Do you know what time it is?
- A few minutes after 8:00.
- And you're still here?
- Don't contradict me, just listen!
- Yes, Mr. Katona. You have to be faster, especially on Christmas Eve.
Am I asking too much?
- No, Mr. Katona.
- All right.
I have great news.
I talked to the hospital, and Mr. Matuschek is much better.
- That's wonderful!
- Can we visit him?
Let's all get together and buy him a nice Christmas present.
Let's get him a little Christmas tree for his hospital room.
That's all very nice, but the best present we could give him is a bare-looking shop with nothing in it except money in the cash register.
Now, come on, folks! Let's make this the biggest Christmas Eve in the history of Matuschek and Company.
Where's Klara!
Klara! Miss Novak!
Coming!
Yes, Mr. Kralik, what is it?
- How are you today?
- Fine.
Good.
We're expecting terrific business today.
It's going to be tough. But don't overdo it.
Miss Novak, may I ask a favor of you?
With pleasure, Mr. Pirovitch.
I wanted to buy one of those Ochi Tchornya boxes, but Kralik tells me you took the only one that really works.
That's right.
I bought it for my boyfriend.
He's coming tonight.
We're going to celebrate Christmas Eve.
- Mr. Pirovitch, can you keep a secret?
- On my word of honor.
When I come back Monday, I might have a ring on my finger. Maybe, you never know.
What?
That's wonderful!
And that's the young man who'll get the cigarette box?
Then let's drop the whole thing.
You see, I thought of giving it to my wife's uncle for Christmas. I'm sorry, can't you give him something else?
It's not so easy.
You see, I don't like him. I hate to spend a nickel on him.
Still, I must give him a present.
I thought if I have to give him a present I might as well give him something he won't enjoy.
The box costs 2.29.
That's a lot of money, but it's worth it to ruin my wife's uncle's Christmas.
I'm sorry, Miss Novak.
I forgot you always liked those.
No, no, Mr. Pirovitch. Speak freely.
If you were in my position what would you give him?
That's hard to say.
What would you say to the idea of let's say, maybe, a wallet?
That's an inspiration.
- One of those imported pigskins?
- That's what I was thinking of.
You can't miss.
If I would get such a wallet, I would be one of the happiest men in the world.
On one side...
Here, I'll show you.
On one side, I put a picture of my wife and on the other side, my little baby.
When I open it, it says, "Papa" and not "Ochi Tchornya."
Thank you, Mr. Pirovitch. I'll think it over.
Kralik, you'll get the wallet.
Mr. Matuschek, what are doing here?
Since when are you back?
I'm supposed to be a pretty sick man, that's what my doctor tells me. But after all, it's Christmas Eve.
I couldn't stay away any longer.
Can you imagine me, over two weeks in the hospital without seeing a single customer?
The only piece of leather goods in the place was my nurse's handbag.
And where do you think she got it?
At Blasek and Company!
And they expect me to get well?
- Have you been by Blasek and Company?
- What kind of business are they doing?
- They're busy, but no comparison with this.
Good. This is all right.
Mr. Matuschek, take it easy.
Don't overdo.
No, I'm not, don't be.
I'm not a fool. I came around to find out if the shop was still here. And then I go.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek.
- Do you think Eric would like that briefcase?
- I don't know. I'm not so sure.
Pardon me, ladies. I can't see very well without my glasses. Could you tell me the price on that briefcase?
24.50.
My, what values you get here.
I wonder how Matuschek and Company can do it.
If you don't know, Mr. Matuschek, who should?
How much is it?
9,654.75.
That's wonderful.
That's the biggest day since '28.
You should be very proud. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Two hours ago when I walked in here, I was a sick man.
But you, Kralik, and you, Pirovitch, you're the best doctors.
And you, Klara and Ilona and Flora, you're wonderful nurses. Thank you.
Pepi, you know what I think about you.
This morning when I received the little Christmas tree you all sent me I was deeply moved.
I read your little note over and over.
And it made me very happy that you missed me and hoped that I'd be coming back home soon again.
You're right, this is my home.
This is where I spent most of my life.
No Christmas is complete without a bonus.
I've called you names on several occasions. When you see the bonus, you'll realize that I didn't mean it.
Thank you, Mr. Matuschek.
I guess that's about all.
Here, what's your name?
- Well, Rudy. - Good boy.
Too much.
We'll leave the shop just as it is until after the holiday.
I want you all to go home now and have a very Merry Christmas.
Well, Kralik 9,654.75.
That's wonderful.
Well, I think I'll have a little dinner now, and celebrate Christmas.
Have you ever been to Biro's?
No sir, I'm afraid that's way over my head.
Christmas only comes once a year.
How about joining me and we'll break a bottle of champagne together?
- Mr. Matuschek, I'd love nothing more...
- You have another engagement?
No, not another word.
I wanted to be sure that you weren't alone.
Have a wonderful time, and Merry Christmas.
The same to you, sir.
Well, Pirovitch. I presume you're going to have a nice party at your house tonight.
You probably have some guests?
No, just my wife, my boy, and my little baby and myself.
That's all we want, and we are very happy.
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Matuschek. - Thank you, Flora.
- Please, give my regards to your mother.
Still hanging around the shop, Mr. Matuschek?
Can't get away from here.
You'd better hurry home, son.
You're probably celebrating Christmas with your family.
Am I wrong? Yes, Mr. Matuschek.
See that girl over there on the corner? - Yeah.
- I'm her Santa Claus. - Good night, Mr. Matuschek.
Mr. Matuschek, I don't know how to thank you for that marvelous present. After all, I'm only working here a short time.
That's all right. What was your name?
Rudy.
- How old are you, Rudy?
That's a wonderful age.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
- It's up to you what you make of it. - Yes, sir.
You better not squander that money.
Go home and give it to your mother.
- My people don't live here in town.
- Is that so? - Have you no other relations here?
You're all alone in Budapest on Christmas Eve?
That's right.
Rudy!
Do you like chicken noodle soup?
I certainly do.
And what would you think of roast goose stuffed with baked apples? And fresh boiled potatoes and butter and some red cabbage on the side?
I'd love it!
And then cucumber salad with sour cream?
Then a double order of apple strudel with vanilla sauce.
Sounds wonderful!
You're going to have it, Rudy.
- It's lovely, I'm sure he'll like it.
- I think so, too.
Merry Christmas, Klara.
I hope it all turns out the way you want it to.
- I'm sorry, I'll be out in a second.
- That's all right, no hurry.
I decided to follow your advice after all.
Want to see something?
That's beautiful.
Why don't you try it on?
I'd like to see what it looks like on a girl.
- Are those real diamonds?
- They're pretty near.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Yes, it probably isn't easy for you to imagine anyone could like a man of my type.
Let's not start all over again.
It's Christmas, and I'd like to be friends.
Beside, you're wrong.
- Do you mind if I tell you something?
- No, not at all.
When I first came to work here, something very strange happened to me.
I got psychologically mixed up.
- You don't say? - Yes.
I found myself looking at you again and again. I just couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I kept saying, "Klara Novak, what on earth is the matter with you.
"This Kralik is not a particularly attractive man."
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, not at all. Now, here comes the paradox.
I found myself falling for you.
- I can't believe it.
- Yes, and very much so.
- You certainly didn't show it.
- In those first few weeks...
I know you won't misconstrue what I'm going to say to you.
After all, I'm happily engaged.
At least it looks that way. Go on.
In those first few weeks, there were moments in the stockroom when you could have swept me off of my feet.
Now I'm getting psychologically mixed up.
I was a different girl, then.
I was rather naive.
All my knowledge came from books, and I'd just finished a novel about a glamorous French actress from the Comédie Française.
That's a theater in France.
When she wanted to arouse a man's interest, she treated him like a dog.
Yes, you treated me like a dog.
But instead of licking my hand, you barked.
My mistake was I didn't realize that the difference between this glamorous lady and me was that she was with the Comédie Française and I was with Matuschek and Company.
Well, that's all forgotten now.
Now you're going to see your girlfriend.
By the way, is it serious?
Yes, very.
Maybe we'll both be engaged Monday morning.
I think we will.
Don't misunderstand me. I just said in my case, it might happen.
As a matter of fact, I can tell you, it will happen.
How do you know?
We won't go into that.
Mr. Kralik, what do you mean you know?
I guess I might as well tell you.
He came to see me.
- Who?
- Your fiancée.
Yes, he came last night.
You shouldn't have told him who I am.
I spent an uncomfortable hour.
Apparently, he didn't believe it when you wrote that I meant nothing to you.
I can't get it into my head.
Coming to see you?
- That doesn't sound like him at all.
- I've straightened everything out.
You don't have to worry.
In a little while you'll be Mrs. Popkin.
That's the name, isn't it?
That's the name he gave me.
Oh, yes, that's right. Popkin. Popkin.
A very nice fellow.
I congratulate you.
I think he's a very attractive man, don't you?
Yes. For his type, I'd say yes.
You would classify him as a definite type?
Absolutely!
And don't try to change him. Don't put him on a diet.
- Would you call him fat?
- I wouldn't, but that's a matter of opinion.
I think that little stomach of his gives him a nice, homey quality.
That's what you want in a husband, isn't it?
- Yes, that's what I want.
- And you're perfectly right.
If I were a girl and had to choose between a young, good-for-nothing with plenty of hair, and a solid, mature citizen I'd pick Mathias Popkin every time.
Anyway, he has a fine mind.
Didn't he impress you as being rather witty?
He struck me as rather depressed, but it's unfair to judge a man when he's out of a job.
Out of a job! He never told me!
That shows you how sensitive he is.
You have nothing to worry about. He feels that both of you can live very nicely on your salary.
Did you tell him how much I make?
He's your fiancée, and he asked me.
When I told him what salary you made, he was a little worried but then I promised him you'd get a raise, and he felt better about it.
Let me tell you, mentioning that bonus didn't do you any harm at all.
This is terrible.
I'm outraged!
I had no idea he was materialistic like this.
If you could read his letters.
Such ideals, such a lofty point of view. - I could quote you passages.
- For instance?
"True love is to be two, and yet one.
"A man and a woman blended as angels.
"Heaven itself." That's victor Hugo.
He stole that.
I thought I was the inspiration for all those beautiful thoughts.
Now I find he was just copying words out of a book.
He probably didn't mean a single one of them.
I'm sorry you feel this way about it. I'd hate to think I'm spoiling your Christmas.
I'd built up such an illusion about him.
I thought he was so perfect.
I had to come along and destroy it.
I guess I really ought to thank you.
Klara, if I'd only known in the beginning how you felt about me things would have been different.
We wouldn't have been fighting all the time.
If we quarreled, it wouldn't have been over suitcases and handbags but over something like whether your aunt or grandmother should live with us or not.
It's sweet of you to try to cheer me up.
I think we'd better say good night.
You have an engagement and so have I, and we shouldn't be late.
Do you know what I wish would happen?
When your bell rings at 8:30, and you open the door instead of Popkin, I come in.
Please, don't make it more difficult for me.
- I'd say, "Klara, darling"...
- No, you mustn't. My dearest, sweetheart Klara, I can't stand it any longer.
Take your key and open post office box 237 and take me out of my envelope and kiss me.
Mr. Kralik, you must...
Dear friend.
You? Dear friend?
Are you disappointed?
Psychologically, I'm very confused but personally, I don't feel bad at all.
When you came to the café that night, I was pretty rude, wasn't I?
No.
- Yes, I was. Don't you remember?
Why, I called you bowlegged.
I was going to prove to you that I wasn't. I was going to go out to the street and pull up my trousers.
Would you mind very much if I asked you to pull them up now?
All right, Verne.
Did you hear me?
I said, come out.
Thirty days in solitary won't make him any easier to handle.
Don't try anything, Verne, or you'll go back in there.
Look him over.
He may have a knife.
Yeah.
Maybe one of them rats in there slipped me one.
But I got a couple of hidden weapons at that, here and here.
- Nobody can take them away from me.
- Come on.
Ninety lashes, 16 months in solitary, seven months in the bear pit and five attempts to escape in three years.
- Don't you like it here, Verne?
- No. Does that answer it?
You put things so clearly.
Maybe we ought to give you a chance to make some new contacts, outside the walls.
- Outside?
- Why not?
Nature surrounded us with something stronger than walls, the jungle.
You know about that don't you, Verne?
So it's tough.
You've plugged up every hole I've ever made, but you know I'm going to make another one.
Yeah, I've heard men talk like that before.
Men like Moussenq.
Six times he got away.
Three times we caught him, and three times the jungle got him for us.
You can't win, Verne.
And why try, when you've only got three years left?
I'd try if I only had three minutes left.
I'm a thief by profession, Grideau, not a convict.
There's nothing won'th stealing around here except freedom, and I'm after some of that.
Verne, I'm going to assign you to the wharf detail outside the walls.
Frankly, it's an experiment.
I've tried everything else with you.
You'll be on your honor.
I haven't got any.
Don't be a sucker.
Yes, well go and clean yourself up.
Report for work at the main gate.
Oh, Verne. I forgot to tell you, there were three or four men, big men like you, who did make it through the jungle.
Except when they got through, I was waiting for them to bring them back.
28, 30, 32, 34, 36. 36, right?
36, right.
Looks like you've had enough, Pop.
Twelve years seems like enough.
More than enough.
Get up, Moussenq.
This is no picnic.
Did he call you Moussenq?
That's my name.
That's all Moussenq is now, a name.
You called me Pop.
How old do you think I am?
You look about 50.
I'm 36 years old, believe it if you can.
Twelve of them I spent in the bear pit and solitary and under the lash.
You've made enough breaks.
Why didn't you get away?
No man can get through that jungle.
It tears you and breaks you and makes you old before your time.
There's nothing a man can't get through to be free.
It's been done.
With help from the outside, a boat waiting down the coast, maybe.
Who knows?
Some way they did it, but not alone.
No, monsieur, it can't be done.
But someday I'll try it again.
Verne.
Drop it and get moving.
Hello, Georges.
You've been such a stranger at the café lately.
Well, you know how it is with a newly married man.
- He feels kind of married, you know?
- Well, in a couple of months, then.
- May I go aboard?
- What for?
Let's say I'm a fool for boats, and I only see one every three months.
Well, maybe you expect something from home?
- In care of the captain.
- Well, I'll take you to him.
Coming, Julie?
There might be some mail.
Mail for me?
- Hello, Julie.
- Go away, Pig.
Oh, Julie, you don't mean it just like that, do you?
After all, there is no harm in being friendly.
Men die all the time and pigs live on and on, when you'd think their own smell would kill them.
Look, how many times have I got to tell you?
You're a pig, a sneak and a dirty stoolpigeon, and I want you to leave me alone.
Watch yourself, baby.
Just act natural like you're alone.
- What do you want?
- Guess.
Why, you crummy convict.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Wait a minute, sweetheart.
Made a nice grab there, didn't I?
Let go, or I'll yell for the guard.
Be nice, or I'll give it a twist.
And they'll fish you out of the drink.
Don't you know what'll happen if you're caught talking to me?
Sure.
They'll throw me into solitary.
Can we fix it to be thrown in together?
You'd like to cut yourself a piece of cake like that, wouldn't you?
Easy, baby.
Listen, if I'm caught talking to a convict, they'll chase me off the island.
Swell.
We'll meet on the mainland, and hit Paris together.
You're from Paris, ain't you?
I said, where you from, baby?
- Marseille.
- Marseille.
Hot blue nights, the right kind of music, it's a date.
A romantic convict.
What are you in for, stealing doilies?
All right, I got no time to mess around.
You're one of the girls at the café, ain't you?
- Ain't you?
- Well, what if I am?
I'll be there tonight.
Keep a light in the window, and a couple more in your eyes.
Tonight you'll be in a cell just where you belong.
And if the walls fall down or something, and you should get out, I'll turn you over to the guards so quick it'll make you dizzy.
You hate hard, baby, so you love hard.
What's your name?
Yvonne, Missy, Julie, Fifi?
Julie.
I'll see you tonight, Julie.
Don't tell me the heat's got you.
I'd swear I saw you talking to yourself.
You werert talking to a convict?
No.
I know better than that.
I was just trying out some new answers.
I'd like to hear some new ones.
Why don't you drop up some night after you've tucked the convicts in the cells?
You lock them up, don't you?
I mean, there's no way they can get out at night, is there?
- No way that they know about.
Why?
- Nothing.
I was just wondering.
30, 32, 34, 35.
Halt.
Louis, there should be 36.
I count 35.
Hurry up there, get up here with the others.
I must have fallen behind.
There was so much to do out there.
Get in line and hurry up about it.
All right, Louis, 36 is right.
Take them away.
March.
- I said I'd be here, baby.
- Yes, so you did.
And here you are, and you're quite a little man.
Now beat it before you get yourself a lot of grief.
Grief ain't what I came after.
You got class, kid.
Or is it because I haven't seen any women lately?
Don't try that again.
Because if you do, I'll break a couple of your bones, if you've got any.
Let's see if you have.
Now get smart.
Why don't you get smart?
You know what they'll do to you.
Sure I do, but I'll take all they've got for a little of this.
I don't know what you'll look like tomorrow, but right now, baby, you're the most beautiful dame in the world.
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Not a thing.
No?
Supposing I wasrt a convict?
Supposing I was sailing through on my yacht or a guy selling brushes...
Yeah, and suppose I was Snow White.
But even if I did think you werert the worst-looking guy in the world, supposing even I told you you looked like someone I was once dumb enough to go for, what would it get me?
If you get caught here, I get sent back to the mainland.
I can think of worse things than that.
Look, this isn't my idea of heaven, either.
Let's get back to supposing.
Supposing I was the guy you were dumb enough to fall for.
- Then what?
- Here's what.
There, you see?
Maybe you wouldn't be so hard to like if you went at things in a nicer way.
It'd be a nice gamble if a guy could win, wouldn't it?
All right, we'll try things your way.
Where do we begin?
Well, I've got a number coming up, and a date with one of the prison directors.
And he should be downstairs now.
Yeah, but I'll tell him I've got a headache or something.
Take off your beard, sweetheart.
Okay. If you want him to find you here, it's no skin off my teeth.
That's right.
So when they start yelling for me to come down and sing my song, I'll...
You'll stay here and sing it.
Sure, sure, what do we care?
We'll take what we've got right now.
Who cares about later?
Let them come and get you.
You're too tough
- and too smart for them all.
- I'm not exactly a cluck, baby.
No, you figure here we are, this is the beginning and the end.
Only a cluck would think of tomorrow.
Well, I'm a cluck.
You're no good to me in a cell.
I'm going down to stall them off.
You wait here.
It's nice of you to try things my way.
- But, monsieur, I assure you...
- He's here some place.
There must be some mistake.
No prisoner would dare come in here.
He was seen climbing in an upstairs window.
You.
We're looking for...
If you're looking for a loose convict, come and get him.
All right, Verne, we've got you.
Don't try anything.
So, you outsmarted me, huh?
That's what happens, they tell me, when smart people get together.
One of them winds up ahead.
And I lose.
Only what happens when I catch up with you?
And I will catch up with you, baby.
The law here denies convicts the privilege of associating with women.
The same law applies to women. Women are not allowed to associate with convicts, on the penalty of expulsion from the colony.
Don't tell me I'm going to be kicked out of this paradise of yours.
All right, come on, give me my ticket.
I'll be on my way.
Well, we don't give out tickets.
Oh, what do you expect me to do, ride out of here on a cloud?
Make it a cloud for two, baby.
We didn't send for you.
You can get out the way you got in.
But, Grideau, it wasrt my fault.
He spoke to me on the dock, and I warned him to keep away from me.
When he didn't, I told him I'd call the guard, and he said if I did, he'd throw me overboard.
How about that, Verne?
Some women would rather drown than talk to a guy like me.
- How did you come to be in her room?
- I told her I'd be there, didn't I?
Why didn't she turn me in before I made good?
Because I didn't believe he would.
He broke into my room, and as soon as I could, I called the guards.
They'll tell you.
Go on, tell him.
So, she ran into the boys.
She was in a spot.
She turned me in to save her own hide.
You're a liar.
You're not going to take the word
- of a slimy convict against mine, are you?
- I might.
But the facts speak more convincingly than either of you.
He was found in your room.
I've got to act accordingly.
Okay. So that's that, and I'm on my way.
But no matter where I go, or no matter how low it is, I'll know that you're no better than me, Monsieur Grideau, or any of the rats in your zoo.
You said you'd catch up with me someday.
Well, I just hope you do.
- And what's going to happen then, baby? - Here's what.
Take Verne to a dormitory.
I'll deal with him in the morning.
You've got 12 hours to leave the colony.
If you're not gone, you'll be put under arrest.
I got an idea, Grideau.
Give me 12 hours to get out, and put her in the dormitory.
That way everybody's happy.
Let go of me.
You heard what he said.
I'm going out the way I came in.
- Send the Pig in.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, monsieur.
But I wonder whether this time instead of paying me the reward, you would grant me a small favor?
Well, what is it?
Well, Julie's not a bad girl.
This business was none of her fault.
And will I let her remain in the colony?
And what makes you think I deal in women, you miserable...
Take your money and get out of here.
Wouldrt have to rely on vermin like him if you men filled your uniforms.
Have you discovered how Verne managed to remain outside the walls?
There's no way of explaining it, sir.
36 men were counted through the gate, and 36 men were counted back, and double counted, sir.
Well, if you're sure of that, then, it certainly is odd.
Isn't that the Bible you're reading?
With the exception of me, this room is filled with men who have forgotten God.
Blasphemers, infidels, atheists.
And God, too, has forgotten them all.
All except me.
I will be forgiven for my sins.
The rest will burn in hell, but I will be forgiven.
- So, that's why you read the Bible?
- Why else?
- There might be many other reasons.
- And there might be none at all.
Look at this pathetic little worm, lulling the ache of his conscience with spiritual aspirin.
I can't think of anything more practical than removing that particular ache.
I can. Removing the conscience.
And you have none, Hessler.
How do you know my name?
I've never seen you before.
That doesn't mean I've never seen you before.
And to look at him is to look at the devil's spawn, señor.
Then pray for me, Telez.
And pray for my father, the devil, too.
You'll burn in hell where you belong.
You'll burn for the evil that you've done, for the lives you've taken.
He has poisoned women for their money.
He deserved the guillotine.
Though I had wretched wives, I had an excellent lawyer.
You were never meant for the scaffold, Hessler, nor for a jail.
Did you hear that, Telez?
I am to be immortal.
That is, if your friend here knows what he's talking about.
He's not my friend.
Perhaps he's yours.
Perhaps he's the devil.
Poor Telez.
I pity him.
Pity?
I don't understand you.
Never having received any pity or pitied anyone, let me plead ignorance.
- I don't know what it is.
- Have you no feelings at all?
For these men?
How can one feel kinship with the dead?
Look at them. Rotting in their graves.
Waiting for their bodies to die.
Perhaps before that happens, they'll get out of their graves.
Not these.
They've dug them too narrow and too deep.
They can never climb out.
- Too weak, perhaps?
- To be weak is to be dead.
- Then to be strong is to live.
- Hasrt it always been so?
It seems to me the mighty have fallen from time to time.
We must talk again, monsieur.
You have a brain.
That makes two of us.
Hi, Superman.
How's the poison holding out?
Always a little left for friends, Verne.
But he can't take that bunk.
Pardon me, but this bunk belongs to someone else.
That so?
But you don't understand.
This bunk belongs to Moll.
Moll, huh?
And right here in the same dormitory.
That's going to be cozy.
What does that rat mean by taking my bunk?
But he's always had this bunk.
Then he might've known I'd be around for it.
Friend of his?
- Why, yes, we're friends.
Why not? - Yeah, why not?
Because he's a maggot, see.
Tell him that I said so.
Tell him that Verne says he's a flatheaded maggot.
Go on, tell him.
Moll.
Nice hero for the kid, ain't he?
A gorilla.
Looks from here as if you couldn't use any part of him.
No, nor any of his friends or monkey ancestors.
- Maybe you're a pal of his?
- Maybe.
Well, then stand up and cut loose, and I'll pick it up from there.
And what could either of us win?
Oh, you're one of those guys that play it safe, huh?
Safe, or maybe smart.
- You been here long?
Do I know you?
- I've been around.
- Maybe we just never made connections.
- Maybe that's it.
What's that book you got there?
Let's see it.
The Bible?
Forget it, pal, you're wasting your time.
So? Maybe you've read it.
Read it?
I know this book backwards.
Before I came here I laid in solitary for six months at Saint Miguel's.
There was one in my cage.
Well, I didn't have nothing else to do, I had to read it.
- Well?
- It don't make sense.
Here, this one will start you talking to yourself.
Listen.
"So God created man in his own image. "
How do you like that?
Now take a look at me.
Do I look like a god to you?
This forsaken place is full of gods, I suppose.
Only they're not working at it right now.
They're gods on a holiday.
Answer that one.
It sounds simple enough.
I think it means that each man has some of the qualities of God inside him, if he wants them, and if he looks for them.
There's a couple here won'th looking for, too.
You remember that one about the Red Sea?
The waters parted and they crossed on dry land?
Maybe I'll try it someday on that jungle out there.
I'll just wave my hand, and there'll be a path, and I'll cross over to the mainland.
And if the path ain't there, I'll make one.
- You'll make what?
- Hello, Moll.
Get your filthy carcass off my bunk.
Sure, Moll.
Where'll you have it?
Moll.
We don't want trouble now.
- I'll murder the bleeding...
- They'll throw you in solitary, Moll.
Yeah, you're right, kid.
I'll move down to the other end where the air's better.
You can have the bunk, Verne.
You'll need it, kicking off the rest of them years.
That's not like Moll to back down that way.
He's not yellow.
- There's something in the wind.
- Maybe there is, Verne, but maybe it isn't blowing your way.
Verne.
- Hello, Flaubert.
- You've got to help me, Verne.
Sure. What do you want me to do, comb a couple of ghosts out of your hair?
Here's another one of your gods, pal, only this one's haunted.
He thinks the people he's killed are chasing him, and the ones he hasn't killed are going to kill him.
He gets it coming and going.
- Perhaps if he knew he had one friend.
- But I haven't, monsieur.
Not one, not one in the world.
Except you, Verne.
- I'm not your friend.
- But you've got to help me.
Moll is planning to escape.
He's taking six men with him.
- Yeah?
- He took my money.
A thousand francs for my share of the expenses, and I know he's going to leave me behind.
I'll get all the blame.
They'll beat me.
They'll put me in solitary.
Please, you've got to get my money back before it's too late.
Then I can tell Grideau that I'm innocent.
You know that he's against me, he's got a grudge against me.
So has Moll.
Why do they pick on me all the time?
Why do they make me so miserable?
You're against me, too.
You're all against me.
How about it, Moll?
You're making a break, am I in?
You blasted loon.
- Give me my money, I'm afraid to go.
- Shut up, you weak swine.
- Am I in, Moll?
- Sure, you're in nothing.
If you think I've spent three years figuring a way to kick out of this joint for your benefit, think again.
You better start thinking, Moll, or else I'm going to slug you.
And if I do, they'll slap us into solitary together.
And how will you get out then, sweetheart?
- You can't make it, Verne.
- Why not?
You'd have to put up money like the rest of us.
A thousand francs.
- I'll get it.
- Where?
There's a lot of men bunking in this room.
Maybe some of them will lend me the money.
I'll lend it to you, Verne.
A thousand for Verne and a thousand for me.
I'll go along, too, if you don't mind.
- Who are you?
- My name's Cambreau.
I never heard of you.
You heard of 2,000 francs, didn't you?
He's got them.
All right, if you're in, listen.
Tomorrow they march us out to work on the road.
When we get there, I put this money in a certain place, and a certain bloke'll come and get it.
It's to pay for a boat that'll be hid along the beach,
- about three days through the jungle.
- How about maps?
Give the mining camp a wide berth.
They're always on the lookout and they'll do you dirt.
The Indian village is worse.
They'll turn you in for 10 francs kicking or five francs cold.
They don't like to take a chance so they cash in for five.
That's the cat country.
Keep a fire burning at night and lie up close to it.
From here on, look out for crocs and snakes.
And don't drink no water while you're in the fever belt.
- You can't mistake it for the stink of it.
- How many maps you got?
Give me one.
There are only two.
The kid has one and I'm keeping this.
He takes one mob with him and you go along with me.
Look out, the guards.
But I've less than 12 hours.
Just lend me enough to get on the boat.
If I lent money to every girl who was ordered out of the colony, where would I be?
Out of business, cherie, believe me...
- Please, Renard.
I promise you, I...
- There's nothing to worry about Julie.
It so happens that I'm making a little trip myself to the mainland, and it is as easy to arrange passage for two as for one.
You'd like to buy in that way, wouldn't you, Monsieur Pig.
Julie, if you only knew me better, I'm not such a bad fellow.
Look. Look, Julie we'll go to the mainland, and then when we get there, and if you still don't think better of me, then you may do as you please.
I'll do as I please right now.
And that doesn't include you.
Can't you get that straight?
Remember this, Pig.
You're the one man in the world I could never get low enough to touch.
- Now get out of here and leave me alone.
Bravo, Julie.
I won't hurry, Julie, because, it looks like you may have to adjust your standards.
Why will she, Monsieur Pig?
Oh, you have a better proposition, Monsieur Marfeu?
Julie can return to the mining camp with me, and I'll have a couple of Indians take her up the coast in a small boat.
And she'll owe me nothing.
And you believe that, Julie?
No, of course not.
Then if you go with him, you're a fool.
And if I go with you, what am I?
- When do we leave, Marfeu?
- In the morning.
You didn't see that, do you hear?
Unless you want me to give it to you, too.
Only one man can run a thing like this.
This is my show and I'm running it my way.
Anybody know anything about this?
Of course not.
- Take him to the hospital.
- Right.
All right, hut.
Watch yourselves.
Come on.
The road gang just made a break.
Moll and a couple of guys got away.
Okay, Moll.
Only one of these days comes the payoff.
Yes, my dear brethren, the day of salvation is at hand.
All right, back to your places.
All right, settle down there. And no talk.
He'll head for the mainland.
When he gets there, if he does, I'll be waiting for him to bring him back.
We'll go this way, Moll.
Here, when Benet comes back, we'll follow this trail to the beach.
He'll never come back.
They'll kill him.
Moll warned us to keep clear of that Indian village.
What have we got to lose?
If Benet gets back we eat.
They've got him, I tell you, and they'll get us.
- We'll never get out of this alive.
- Maybe you won't, but I will.
Why you and not us?
Because I've prayed and I will be saved.
You might have prayed for me, too.
It's not his god he's counting on, it's the food he has hidden.
And what if I have?
It's all mine, do you hear?
It's mine.
Did you pray for that, Telez, or did you steal it?
It makes no difference.
It's God's will.
Benet.
- They got him.
- Quick.
- Where are you going?
- After food.
Didrt we decide not to take a chance on that mining camp?
You decided that.
Well, who's running this, me or you?
Do you want to get caught?
No, but we'll need food.
Without it, we couldn't all reach the boat alive.
What of it?
The best of us'll get through, won't they?
And that's us.
All of us aren't going to get through anyway.
You know that, don't you?
You picked the men who were to go with you very carefully, Moll.
Sure I did.
Do you know why?
Because we'll be at least 10 days in that boat, and there are rations enough for six men.
Figure it out for yourself.
I've already figured it out, Moll.
And we'd better be careful with those rations.
I'll be back.
He's asking for trouble.
What with them murdering Indians and jungle animals, he ain't got an earthly.
He'll be back.
I'll bet on it.
Because he said he would.
Because he says something, does that make it so?
It has so far.
He said we'd reach that mining camp this afternoon, and we did.
According to the map, we should have reached it.
Three times we were lost, and each time he led us back to the trail.
He stumbled on it.
And when our tongues were hanging out from thirst, he stepped off the trail and found a brook. What was that, Moll?
So he had a lucky day.
- Who is Cambreau?
- How do I know?
Oh, he's just another prison mug like you and me.
Of course he is.
He's got to be.
This jungle heat does crazy things to your mind.
Rain again.
You're not leaving us, are you, Julie?
Now, is that nice?
Havert I been pretty decent about everything?
- Gave you a first class home, didn't I?
- Yeah, you're grand people.
You brought me here as a favor to help me on my way to the mainland.
And it wasrt going to cost me a thing.
- Oh, now, Julie.
- Let me by.
So you think you're checking out, eh?
Well, what have I got to say about it?
- Go on, tell me.
What?
- Put that down, you little...
Julie.
Not that way, Julie.
The voice came from here.
I heard it.
The sack of food's gone.
He paid for it, too, whoever it was.
Five hundred francs would take you to the mainland.
But we can't have any of that, can we?
Look at him sleep.
He's got his belly full of food.
You're young and quick.
Look.
There'd be only one blow.
He'd never know.
- Go on.
- I can't.
I don't know how to kill.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Marfeu, maybe I've been a bad loser.
I've fought as hard as I could and it got me nothing.
I don't know what I expected.
Maybe what I got.
- Maybe I figured you wrong from the start.
- You made a mistake.
We can assume it was not your first.
Look, I've been here now for, well, for a while.
Shouldrt that be enough?
Give me a chance, Marfeu.
Let me go, will you?
There should be violins playing when you talk that way, Julie.
You've got the money that was left for the food.
It's enough to get me to the mainland.
I'll pay it back.
I promise, every sou, as soon as I can get it. I swear.
Yeah?
And what do I win?
Why do you think I pulled you out of a mess back there, and brought you here?
To send you away in a golden carriage?
You're not going anyplace.
You're staying here until I throw you out.
Can you understand that?
Don't move, or I'll brain you.
I want grub and I want it quick.
Get over there.
Hello, baby.
Caught up with you like I said, didn't I?
So we'll pick up where we left off, only first I'll have something to eat.
- Get it out here.
- Lf you want any food, get it yourself.
Open them cans.
Hug that bed, you. One funny move and I'll crack your leg.
Dump it in there.
Sit over there where I can watch you.
Garbage.
But good enough for a man when he's starving.
- So you'll do, too, baby.
- Thanks.
This is no time to be particular.
Funny a man should want something he's got no use for, and I got no use for you.
You know that, don't you?
And how much do you think I think of you?
How much?
So much that if you ever made the mistake of turning your back on me,
- I'd...
- You'd run a knife into it?
You ain't got that kind of stuff, sweetheart.
There they are, but you won't use them.
It takes something to gamble that way, something a cheap dame hasn't got.
And you're cheap.
If you'd have waited back there, and run the scissors into me when I wasrt looking, I'd have loved you for it, but you sneaked out for the law.
That's what a cheap dame would do.
So tomorrow the Indians can have you.
Do I say thanks, baby, or were you just waving at something?
Don't thank me.
I didn't give you a thing.
All I want is to get out of here and you happened to be going my way, so I played you.
But the minute I find somebody going faster than you, I'll...
You won't.
Come on.
- What are you after?
- Something somebody left for me.
Never mind that.
Come on.
"Behold, thou art fair, my love, behold, thou art fair.
"Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil.
"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy mouth is comely.
"Thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate, behind thy veil.
"Thou art all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee. "
How do you like that, baby?
Great stuff, huh?
I guess nobody ever said anything like that to you before, did they?
Does that put me out in front or not?
Listen. "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
"Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes.
"How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride.
"How much better is thy love than wine,
"and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices.
"Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb.
"Honey and milk are under thy tongue
"and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. "
That's saltwater, Moll.
You can't drink it.
You'll go mad.
Saltwater?
It's this heat.
Where's the boat?
There's water in the boat and food.
- Where is it?
- Around that point of land.
I'll find it.
You stay here.
We made it.
The swine.
Thought they could lock me up forever.
Moll.
- Hello, kid.
How are you?
- Cambreau gave us food and water.
- We'll be all right.
- Sure you will be.
Where are the others?
Dunning was shot as we were leaving the island.
At the Indian village, Benet went after food.
They got him.
What about Telez? Huh?
What about Telez?
He didn't have the strength.
There was nothing we could do.
He just died.
It's true, Moll, we tried to save him.
I swear it.
Who cares?
So he died.
One less to go in the boat.
Five of us.
And more than enough room for seven.
It's too bad Verne was hurt.
Maybe it's healthier where he is.
Maybe he wouldn't fit in my plans.
Plans often have to be changed, Moll.
You're such a pessimist, Cambreau.
Has nothing ever turned out well for you?
Quite the contrary, Hessler.
Many things have happened just as I planned them.
Telez!
I'll kill them.
They stole my crucifix.
A healthy-looking ghost, Monsieur Dufond.
He had food, he wouldn't give us any.
It was our lives or his.
What would you have done, Moll?
We were starving.
I'd have done the thing up right and finished him.
They took my bread and my cross.
They left me to die.
Easy, you're hurt.
Let's have a look at that leg.
Dufond, tear away the trouser.
He's been bitten by a snake.
- Let us help you, Telez.
- No, not you.
Don't you touch me.
Don't let him touch me.
He's the devil.
He's the devil, I tell you.
Do you suppose that's the answer, Moll?
Interesting idea there, anyway.
Cambreau, the devil.
This swelling will have to be lanced, Cambreau.
- You seem to know what you're doing.
- I was a medical student, a lifetime ago.
Let's have your knife, Flaubert.
- I haven't got a knife.
- Moll, get his knife.
Moll, I...
Easy.
- It won't drain unless someone... - Well?
I can't do it.
My lips are chapped.
I'll get the poison in my system.
Then again, you might not.
The point is, it has to be done.
I hope that'll help you, Telez.
That was a pretty gesture.
But lancing that wound and drawing out the venom won't help.
- He'll be dead at dawn.
- Could we let him die believing that none of us cared whether he lived or not?
Why not?
It's the truth, isn't it? Why should he die believing a lie?
Maybe he won't.
Maybe Telez will know the truth when it's time.
Where are all the others?
They're getting the sloop.
They won't sail without me.
How little you know men.
How evil they are.
Only God is good.
But the good in man is God, Telez.
Only God is good.
Only God can forgive.
They stole my crucifix, Cambreau.
Without it, I'm lost.
I'm afraid.
A crucifix is a piece of wood, Telez, only a piece of wood.
The miracle is not in the wood, but in the heart.
- But I've prayed, I've prayed.
- And your prayers were only words.
Like your crucifix, they found no way to your heart.
Telez, the bread stood between them and your heart.
But it wasrt enough.
I had to look out for myself.
And will you look out for yourself, then, through all eternity?
- I know, God has forsaken me.
- You have forsaken him.
I'll die in darkness and be cursed.
I'll never find peace or forgiveness.
Cambreau, help me, help me to find God.
Then look for him, Telez.
Search your heart.
You drew the poison from my body into your own.
I had bread and I would not share it.
"Or what man is there of you,
"whom, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?"
It's not too late?
It's never too late.
A moment ago, there was so much darkness.
I was afraid.
It's lighter now.
My fear is gone.
You brought me peace, Cambreau, and rest.
And if, some time, things are said against me, you'll speak for me?
I'll speak for you, Telez.
What makes you think he'll like it better under a lot of dirt than in the belly of a shark?
Well, maybe he rates a grave at that.
He paid for it.
- Here, here's your end.
- I'm afraid I can't use it, Verne.
Oh, so I'm a swine for robbing the dead?
Maybe if I'd crack through with enough for a boat to take us to the mainland you wouldn't come along.
Here, here's your book of rules.
Maybe you can talk him into a set of wings.
I can try.
"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God,
"and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?
"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy
"for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. "
That's nice music, only what does it mean?
You heard what he said, didn't you, about the temple of God?
You know who he's talking about, don't you?
About me.
All right, you don't have to believe it if you don't want to, but I'm telling you.
Whenever you want, what's the word, Cambreau, sanctuary.
Whenever you want sanctuary, babe, here's where you'll find it.
Right here in the old temple.
Don't tap your heart, you'll break your finger.
And if you're sanctuary, I'll take whatever else is lying around.
Yeah?
Well, you better get ready to take it, babe, because here it comes.
So, Verne made it, did he?
Give me that knife of yours, Flaubert.
And he brought a woman along with him, too.
Now ain't that thoughtful?
Hello, Verne.
You made it through, huh?
I'd have been here sooner if a shoe hadrt slipped out of somebody's hand and landed on my head.
You ought to fire your valet for being so careless.
I see you brought a friend along with you, too.
Always room for one more in the boat.
And if there isn't, you can always stay behind.
We'll cut up our rations with you, and our water.
What do you say?
- Big-hearted, ain't you, Moll?
- Why not? We're all together, aren't we?
Everything is share and share alike with us.
With all of us, ain't it, with everything?
Sure it is, with everything that's yours and not mine.
Do you get that, Moll?
And do you get it, you mugs?
Take a good look, because that's all any of you are going to get.
Anybody got any other ideas?
- I have some.
- Wait a minute.
Let's have your knife, Flaubert.
Where is it?
I gave it to Moll.
Nothing like a little edge, huh, sweetheart?
I don't need any with you, Verne.
I forgot I had it.
Throw him in the boat and let's get out of here.
From now on, I'm in charge.
- Looking for something, Moll?
- Yeah, something I lost.
- Where'd you lose it?
- On the beach.
Somebody got lucky with a punch.
Well, maybe someday you'll get lucky, too.
When you stop leading with your chin.
How do you like being the only woman in the world, Julie?
Well, I don't take these shipboard romances seriously.
- Still it has its advantages.
- And perhaps its disadvantages, too.
We might decide we don't want any women in this particular world.
And you're just the baby to take care of that, aren't you, Hessler?
But then I figure I'm safe.
You always married your women before you poisoned them, isn't that so?
And I don't think the captain would marry us.
Or why don't you start reading out of that book, and I'll jump off the boat.
Don't give me any of that "sister, come to salvation" look.
I'm not buying any.
I know the routine.
It starts out with a prayer, and ends up with a Bible in one hand and me in the other.
Hey, baby.
Stop messing around with the crew and get back here.
You belong at the captairs table, don't ever forget that.
- What was that for, baby?
- For fun, that's what.
So we're playing games, are we?
Okay. What'll we play, sweethearts?
Why not?
It's a game we're good at anyway.
Then get one up here fast.
Again.
Again?
Very pretty.
So sweet, so touching and sickening.
What good can ever come from a man like that?
Or a woman like that?
I've heard of it happening before.
Why can't it happen again?
We ought to make the mainland in a couple of days, kid, if the wind holds out.
- And what then?
- That's what I was wondering.
I thought maybe you and me might string along together.
You wouldn't want me around, Moll.
I'd just get in your way. I'm not a good thief.
Not that I have the conscience, it just is I haven't got what it takes to make a man steal.
Oh, but you wouldn't have to.
You see, I've always dodged around alone, because I figured a guy shaves a percentage against himself if he plays it alone.
But I've gotten to like you quite a bit, kid, you know?
Like a guy does his kid brother.
How does that strike you?
Well, why shouldn't I like you, Moll?
You have everything I haven't got.
Courage, for one thing.
And you've been decent to me.
I'd never have made it alone if it hadrt been for you.
And I'll see you through from here on in.
We'll travel far and we'll travel fast.
Does that make it a deal?
- Who's your pal, kid?
- You are, Moll.
Right.
Let's have some more of that song you were singing, huh?
Perhaps we should all sing.
But what have we got to sing about?
Well, we're alive and the past is behind us.
And there's always a chance of something better up ahead, if the wind holds out.
One two, three, four, five.
Five days.
We'll die here.
All of us.
Moll.
I've got to have water.
Now hold onto yourself, kid.
If you drink yours now, you'll be thirsty by night.
The surll dry it out of you just as fast as you pour it in.
But it's so hot, it's so hot.
Why doesn't the wind come?
Cambreau, why doesn't the wind come?
The wind should come soon.
But before it comes, some of us may die.
Did you hear what he said, Verne?
Before the wind comes...
That's what he says, and I say he's wrong.
I know as much about it as he does.
But he knew when the wind was dying.
He told us to be careful of the water because there'd be days of calm.
- He does know, Verne.
- All right, he knows.
Any minute now, he'll pull a fast one out of that little book of his and it'll rain milk.
Come on, Cambreau, go into your miracle.
Don't be a fool, Verne.
I'm no more religious than you are, but does this look like a good time for blasphemy?
That's not what you'd call good politics, my friend.
How do you figure some of us will die, Cambreau?
Possibly because there's no sign of any wind yet, and if the wind doesn't come, it becomes a matter of endurance, doesn't it?
And some of us may not have the strength to pull through.
It's simple enough when you reason it out, isn't it?
I'm sorry to disappoint all you big, strong gorillas, but I feel fine.
You're the second best man in the boat, baby.
I can't stand it any longer.
Moll, I've got to have water.
- All right, kid.
- No, you can't have it.
- Get away from that keg.
- You can't give him any.
- What about the rest of us?
- He can have my share, can't he?
Get away from that keg, Flaubert.
Get back where you were, Moll.
Get away from that keg or I'll pitch you out of the boat.
Now.
- Let's see you get it now.
- You fool.
- Well, that's the end of the water.
- And the end of hope.
You're thinking it's my fault.
Why don't you say so?
Shut up.
It's done and that's that.
Well, why doesn't somebody do something about getting it back?
Sharks.
- Arert you going to do anything to me?
- Why should we?
But I threw away your water and you'll die.
You'll die with us if we do.
I thought they were trying to take something away from me, but they werert, were they?
No.
All these years, I've been afraid of things that didn't exist.
I looked for enemies where I might have found friends.
I tried to escape a life that I might have been forgiven for.
Flaubert!
No, let him go, kid.
Moll thinks I'm afraid, but I'm not.
You know I'm not afraid, don't you, Cambreau?
You're not afraid, Dufond.
Verne.
Come back here.
- Come back here.
- Let me go.
I didn't mean to hurt you, kid, but it would have been suicide.
- You wanted to save him, didn't you, Moll?
- Sure, that's all.
- He'll be all right in a jiffy.
- I'm afraid not, Moll.
- Why?
What do you mean?
- He's dead.
But he can't be. Why?
Why should he be?
Kid.
That's two dead.
Don't let me be afraid, Verne.
Do you hear? Don't let me be afraid.
Why should you be?
Men die every day.
Hessler, come to life and haul in that keg.
The surs going down, Verne.
What about the water?
All right, Cambreau, dish out what we got coming to us.
The barrel might have leaked. There may be saltwater in it.
Well, give it here, then. I'll take a swig of it.
We'd better draw lots for that, Verne.
If you took one swallow of saltwater, your thirst would increase thousands of times over.
And that would mean...
Tell him, Hessler.
The tongue swells until it protrudes from the mouth.
Not a very pleasant way to die.
Well, why swallow the water? Why not taste it?
Our palates are in no condition to taste anything, Verne.
You couldn't tell freshwater from salt until it was down.
That makes it one mars game.
How do we draw lots?
Here, here are four strips.
The one who draws the longest drinks the water.
Why four strips when I count five of us in the boat?
There are only four men, Julie.
But all five of us drink, don't we?
I don't want any free rides.
Here, add that to your collection.
Take your choice.
Well, it leaves you and me, huh, baby?
And one of them is the long one, ain't it?
You're out of luck, Verne, I always get the short end of the deal.
Here, in case I lose, this will get you to Marseille.
Give my regards to the girls.
So, a mars tongue swells until it chokes him to death.
- How does that sound to you, Moll?
- What are you waiting for?
- You aren't afraid, are you?
- Maybe I am. A man don't like to die.
You don't want to die either, do you baby?
Take one.
- All right, Moll, take the tiller.
- Wait a minute sweetheart, sit still.
You don't think we'd ask you to get your own, do you?
Sit right where you are, I'll fetch it for you.
A little cup of water.
Maybe it's good and maybe it's bad.
Up until now you've been pretty lucky, what with one thing and another.
- How lucky do you feel now, Verne?
- Give it here.
What's your hurry?
Can't wait to feel it running down, huh?
Maybe it'll be nice and cool, and maybe, if it's salty, it'll sting and burn, and then you'll sit there staring, waiting for the old man with the long whiskers.
You know about the old man with the long whiskers, don't you, Verne?
He's been right here on this boat with us all the time.
He got Flaubert and he took the kid.
Maybe he could have waited a little while about the kid, though, but I guess it's all right.
He didn't mean much to anybody, except to me.
He didn't have what a man needs in this world, what you've got, Verne.
He wasrt strong like you.
He didn't have your insides.
He didn't have much of anything.
He was just a nice kid, that's all.
And maybe he would have missed me if I went first, like the girl there will miss you when you go.
So why should we let her in for that?
You won't be needing that anymore.
Cambreau, I don't want something for nothing, but suppose I've been wrong all me life.
Would it do any good, do you think, to admit it now?
If a man came to you and admitted he was wrong and you felt he was sorry, what would you do?
That's good enough for me.
I've been the world's biggest sucker, ain't I, up to now?
How are you coming, Julie?
Nothing like an ocean trip to put the old kink in your hair.
I'll bet it looks awful.
Cambreau, tell me.
What makes you guess right all the time?
It's like you got an old crystal ball or something that you look into, and you know about things like the wind and the water and the men.
And you got to every one of them, too, before they went.
I didn't get to them, Julie, they got to themselves.
And now maybe I'm going to die and you're waiting for me to buy in, too, is that it?
I don't think you're going to die for a long time.
Then why buzz around me if I'm not going to die?
Well, you asked me to come over.
And you jumped at the chance.
You thought maybe my black heart had turned white overnight, and I wanted forgiveness.
Maybe I'd start telling you about the years I spent kicking myself around till I got good and lost, and then say, "Cambreau, come find me
"and start me off with a clean sheet of paper. "
But I'm no sucker.
Can you see me with a job, maybe, and a hall room somewhere, a room of my own?
Can you picture a man tipping his hat to me because I look like he should?
I've lived my way, let me die my way.
Maybe if you'd told me all this, Julie, you'd have told me where Verne fits in.
That crystal doesn't miss a thing, does it?
So maybe I ought to lie to you and say, "Who cares what happens to Verne?"
But you'd know the truth.
You'd know I could want a lot of things if Verne were around.
But he'd have to want them, too.
I can't speak for him.
Nobody can do anything for that guy except pray, and I don't know how to pray.
Strange you should say that, Julie.
You've been doing nothing else all this time.
Cambreau, why are you doing that?
Verne.
Verne, he's dropping the sails.
Cambreau, put them sails up.
What are you trying to do?
We're off the mainland.
They're probably waiting for us.
We'd better heave to and slip in tonight.
What?
We're off the mainland?
Hey, hey, baby.
Baby, we made it.
We beat them.
The dogs, we beat them.
All right, turn her adrift.
What about Moll?
We can't leave him here.
Why not?
They'll pick up the boat and find him there.
Which is exactly what Verne wants them to do.
- Right, Verne?
- Right.
- Who is it?
A friend.
Open the door.
I want some of that.
Here.
Now, easy, kid.
Don't drink it all at once.
There.
There, that's enough for right now.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Why?
I, I thought a...
- Yeah, well, think again.
Get some food on the table.
Did you hear that, babe?
All the food your little basket can hold.
We got through and we're here alive.
We're here all right, and then it's Marseille, Paris, anywhere you say, babe.
Because I got it all figured out for us.
You cook up a pretty fancy stew.
What else can you do?
Can you navigate a boat?
Yes, monsieur, but then I have no boat of my own.
No?
Hessler.
Where did you put that razor?
Right over there.
But my boat is a small one, only 60 feet.
This wouldn't be Christmas, would it?
Food, clothes, a boat and a skipper.
What more could you want?
We'll pay for the use of your boat and your services.
Nothing like keeping it clean, huh, Cambreau?
What sort of men are you, monsieur?
If you are in trouble, I...
Like the lilies of the field, my friend. We toil not, neither do we spin.
And this, gentlemen, seems to be as good a time as any for me to be on my way.
Even in this benighted town there must be a lady who awaits me, a lonely lady with money.
Right back to your old tricks, huh, pal?
"Love the little trade which thou has learned, and be content therewith. "
That's Marcus Aurelius, Verne, and a wise man, too.
Well, Cambreau, I hope you have better luck with Verne than you had with me.
You know, of course, that your chances to herd me into your little flock were limited, because I'm not exactly sheep-like.
And you deal mostly in sheep, don't you, Cambreau?
Well, perhaps you and I will meet again.
No, Hessler.
I'm afraid we two will never meet again.
Be grateful, Cambreau.
Without an occasional defeat, your victories would be empty things.
Gentlemen.
No.
Better get that boat ready, gimpy.
We'll be sailing pretty soon.
As you say, monsieur, but you should know there is a storm coming up.
What storm?
I call it a wind and a good one.
- And we're sailing with it.
Now beat it.
- Yes, monsieur.
- What's the name of your crate?
- The Dolphin.
She rides at anchor in the lower cove.
How do we know he won't turn us in?
- Suppose I follow him.
- And who'll follow you?
I'll be back, Verne.
- Come out here baby, I want to talk to you.
- I'm busy. I said, come out here.
Looks like here's where we make up our mind about things, huh, baby?
Hey, makes a difference, don't it?
- It's divine.
- Come here.
- Who's a rat, baby?
- You are.
But I'll do just the same, huh?
Right here.
A woman would be a chump to go on with a guy like me, wouldn't she?
What could she win?
It's what you call making it the hard way.
You can't travel that way, can you, baby?
Maybe that's it.
But you'd do me a favor and drag me along with you anyway, wouldn't you?
- From sewer to sewer.
- But on plush cushions.
If there's anything I want all I have to do is ask for it, and you'd steal it for me.
Well, there's nothing I want you could steal.
So that's it?
Suppose I said, "Listen, honey, as soon as we get to Cuba,
"we're getting married and from there on we're playing it according to the book?"
Maybe you could use a little of that, huh?
Not if it came from you, Verne, because you couldn't say it.
But suppose I did?
Suppose I promoted that little home by the side of the road,
- with the kiddies playing in the sunshine?
- You're laughing.
And how I'm laughing.
Where'd you pick up that junk, from Cambreau?
Maybe I thought it out all by myself.
Well, from now on it's going to be different.
Yeah.
And do you know why?
Because I've seen men die. They were thieves like you and as rotten as me, but when their time came, they suddenly got hold of something, something they'd never had, something won'th having.
Well, whatever it is, I don't want to wait that long for mine.
I want it now.
Great stuff, so long as it fits in with what I got in mind.
When we travel, we travel my way.
What makes you think I'm going your way.
Because you're stuck, kid, that's why.
You're a liar.
I hate the sight of you.
I hate everything you stand for.
Even if I didn't, even if I loved you so much it was killing me, and I knew you'd haunt me for the rest of my life, I still wouldn't have any part of you.
I only hope they take you back to that prison you belong in.
You'll be better off back there than free to do the things you will do.
The whole world will be better off without you.
And that's how it is, babe, and what can we do about it?
- Well, it's hard for me to believe.
- It's plain enough.
This cask was full of saltwater, so they must have died of thirst.
And this man, Moll, was the last to go.
I'd have staked anything that Verne would outlive them all.
Unless, monsieur, he went first with a knife in his back?
Well, it's possible, and it's too bad.
He was the only one of the pack won'th saving.
Well, may as well get back to the colony.
- That boat out there, do you belong on it?
- No. There's nobody coming ashore from her tonight.
Sails for America at dawn.
Would they take a passenger, do you think?
- Well, how do I get out to her?
- In a rising gale?
Maybe you can hire someone to take you out, but that ain't me.
Good evening, Julie.
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same thing of you.
Where else should I be?
I'm on my way to America.
I sail in the morning.
- America is so far away.
- Far away from what?
Who knows?
Perhaps, Julie, if you were to go back to the colony you might be very happy if it could be arranged, and I think it can.
Since we talked, things have happened that might...
That might increase my influence with certain people.
But no matter how you color it up, you go with the proposition, don't you, Pig?
You could do worse, say with a man like Verne.
What about Verne?
He escaped with some others and Grideau and I came to pick him up when he landed here.
- And have you got him?
It seems he died at sea, or that's what Grideau thinks.
But you don't.
Smart man, Verne.
He has something. Something I'd like to have.
Lovely, aren't they, Julie?
Yeah, lovely.
You'd look ducky in that black one.
Any way out of this place except this door?
The alley around the corner.
It's a small world, isn't it, Pig?
Just what is it you're after?
We both know what, Julie.
And it's time we talked about facts.
There are worse things, Julie, than stringing with a pig like me.
There is such a thing as watching a man that means something to you hunted down and dragged back on the end of a chain.
All right, so you've hunted him down.
Let's see you drag him back.
Go on. I am no fool.
There is a better way.
Grideau won't let him get away this time.
But if I go back with you, you won't tell Grideau?
It's me for Verne, is that it?
Well, if it is, then take him.
Go tell Grideau.
And as for my going anyplace with you, I still pick my own gutters.
Wait a minute.
Pig, wait a minute.
Just give me five minutes, that's all.
Five minutes to make sure he gets away and after he's gone, I'll go with you.
It would be simpler if we just went away together now.
No, I want to see him go, I want to be sure.
Don't you trust me, Julie?
After you see him go, come in and get me.
I'll wait for you.
So, you're back, baby.
Nice to see you again.
I've come back to tell you you got to get out.
- Grideau's in town.
- Grideau, eh?
Nice fellow.
What'd he have to say for himself?
Well, I didn't talk to him.
I didn't even see him.
No?
Then how do you know he's here?
Or maybe you talked to somebody else.
Don't ask so many questions.
Just get going.
There's a storm coming up and you never can tell.
You're right, kid, you never can tell.
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm not going with you, Verne.
I told you that once before and I meant what I said.
I thought maybe you'd changed your mind.
There's a freighter pulling out for America in the morning and I'm going to be on it.
Okay, baby if that's what you want.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I want.
Only, don't hang around here any longer.
Every minute counts.
Get going.
Yes.
Yes, you're right, kid.
I'd better hustle.
Grideau is a smart fellow.
He won't want to miss out on me again.
I wouldn't be surprised if he'd offered a reward.
A nice fat one.
Juicy enough to buy passage to America on a freighter.
Good thing you can be trusted.
So long, babe.
- Verne.
- Yeah?
Plant one here.
It'll hold until we meet up again.
Julie.
I'll buy you a new coat, a nice one in the morning.
Made out of pigskin.
So, Grideau's got himself two pigs now.
I didn't tell him.
I swear I didn't, Verne.
You're a liar.
You brought him here.
You turned me over just like you did back there on the island to keep your own hide out of trouble.
If that's what you want to think, okay.
Only get out of here.
Get out of here before it's too late.
I'm thinking of you, Verne.
Yeah, yeah, very cute.
You always could pour it on, couldn't you?
You had me winging, I'll say that for you, right smack up to the minute where I saw you through the window, both of you.
I wasrt going to turn you in, Verne.
It's a great spot for a dame to bring a guy up to a point where he can't see anything else in the world except her.
You had me where there was nothing I wouldn't have done for you.
I'd have gone on being a thief or I'd have tried it the other way, if that was what you wanted.
How does that sound?
It's everything I've wanted to hear.
Only why did you have to wait till now to tell me, now that you've got to get out of here?
She's right.
And if you go now they'll never catch you.
Come on, Pig, where's Grideau?
Is he on his way here or is he waiting to pick me up at the cove?
Verne, I haven't told a soul.
Why should I?
Verne, he's telling the truth.
He hasn't told anyone you're here.
And if I let him go what do you think he'll do?
So, you made a mistake, Pig.
This is one time in your life you should've squealed.
If you ran away now, Julie, you could get on that boat to America.
- That's just what I'm going to do.
- But if you stayed you could save him.
- Save the Pig for what?
- Not the Pig, Julie, Verne.
Verne, you fool.
Let him go.
Did you hear me, Verne?
I said let him go.
Oh, so that's the way it is, huh?
When a woman picks up a mars fight, she's really on his side, ain't she?
Give me that.
All of a sudden, things look different, don't they, baby?
Stand over there with him and let's see what you look like.
Get over there.
All right, there he is, Julie.
Take him. He's yours.
That's what you're asking for, isn't it?
Well, is it or isn't it?
Yeah, that's it.
All right, you've got it.
Now get out of here both of you.
Come on, get moving.
- Goodbye, Cambreau.
- I'll see you again, Julie.
Of course, the facts are, she's always hated the Pig.
She went to the jungle with Marfeu rather than go with him.
And she'd rather go back with the Pig than go on with me.
What's that look like from where you stand?
It looks like something a woman in love might think of.
I get it.
You've got it all figured out according to the book.
Julie put on an act with Cochon for my benefit, so I wouldn't throw a slug into him.
Now she's going back to the island to marry him so he won't turn me in to the law, huh?
Very nice.
Get some music, I'll sing it for you.
It's just that it makes sense to me that way.
And what if you're right?
What am I supposed to do?
Turn noble and go back to a dozen bear pits to get her out of hock?
I've come a long ways to get here.
I'm out and I'm on my way and if you're coming, come on.
- All right, get in the dinghy.
- But, monsieur, it will be a heavy storm.
Perhaps we should wait until tomorrow morning.
Get in that boat.
Come on, Cambreau.
Get below and start that engine.
Not bad.
Good enough to take a man anywhere he wants to go.
Any place in the world.
- Sounds like you're a free man, Verne.
- As free as any man alive.
In three or four days, maybe a week, I'll be in Cuba.
I won't have to sneak in the back way neither.
So far as anybody knows, I'm dead.
The Pig knows you're alive, so does Hessler.
Hessler won't talk.
Neither will the Pig.
Julie won't let him.
How do you know?
It won't be the first time she turned you in.
I know she won't. She's all right about some things, things like that.
- Anyway, I'm not going to worry about it.
- But you are. All your life you're going to worry about it.
Until the day you die, you're going to be sorry you turned her over to the Pig.
Another one of your tinorn prophecies, huh?
Well, keep them to yourself.
I'm a free man, I tell you, and no dame can cut into that.
I'm on my way to Cuba and nothing can stop me.
You're a strong man, Verne, stronger than Moll was, stronger than the prison you broke from, stronger than the odds that were against you.
What are you getting around to?
You've got everything you'll ever want, Verne.
You'll do what you want to do, go where you want.
You're sufficient unto yourself.
You don't need a thing.
Certainly you don't need me.
I'm no good here.
And there may be something I can do for someone else, if I stay behind.
You wouldn't do something for yourself, would you, pal?
Something like talking to Grideau?
There's nothing I want from Grideau. And there may be others to talk to, as there was Telez, Flaubert and Dufond.
You sent them on their way with a smile and a prayer.
Do you still think that prayers pay off, Cambreau?
They may help a little.
Well then, you better start saying them quick.
Lift up your hands, close your eyes and give them all you got.
I don't have to make it any clearer, do I?
There's only one other man in the world that knows I'm alive and who'll say so outside of you.
I'm depending on a dame to keep his mouth shut,
- but who's going to shut yours?
- It looks like you will, Verne.
But what about you, when I'm gone?
You'll have thrown away everything won'th having, the chance to live like other men, a woman who loves you and your last friend.
- What'll you have left?
- What I've always had.
Whatever it is that keeps a man on his own feet without any help from anybody.
- What's it called, Verne?
- You name it, I've got it.
It's taking me on my way now.
You can come along, or you can have it the other way.
It'll have to be the other way.
I can't go with you, Verne.
Well, what are you waiting for?
It shouldn't be hard.
Throw me into the sea and it's all over.
- It's simple enough, if you can do it.
- Lf I can do it?
- What would I be afraid of?
- Of yourself, perhaps, or what happens to a man after he's killed another man.
- You're asking for it, Cambreau.
- Then why don't you give it to me?
Or does it take something to kill me you haven't got?
Now what do you think I got, Cambreau?
Remember, you asked for it!
You asked for it and you got it.
You can't let him drown.
You have to save him.
Why not?
Get forward and ship that anchor.
- Then get on the wheel and head north.
Verne!
I can't hang on much longer!
I don't hear you begging me to help you.
Smart stuff, you're saving your breath.
You don't want anything from me.
What have I got to give?
Verne, the scum of the world.
Up there, that's where you're going to get your help from.
You got nothing to worry about.
Sing out some prayers, relax, and wait for the water to dry up.
Grab hold of a miracle, Cambreau.
No one can save him but you, monsieur.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said, Cambreau?
In heaven and on Earth, in all the world there's nobody can save you but me.
So when you say your prayers, say them to me, Cambreau.
I'm the only god you can call on now. I'm the old temple remember?
You were right when you said God was in me.
God's in everybody.
Gimpy's God.
I'm God.
You're...
You're...
Cambreau!
Cambreau!
Cambreau.
Cambreau.
It's no use, he's gone.
He figured it like that.
Everything he said, everything he did, he had it all worked out to the end.
You're an awful sucker to do things like that for rats like me.
Monsieur.
Verne, are you crazy?
Grideau's on that boat.
He'll see you.
And if he sees me, he'll take me, won't he, baby?
I thought you'd be halfway to Cuba by now.
Maybe I didn't like the idea of you going with the Pig.
What do you care?
We're going to be married, and I expect we'll be very happy.
Yeah, and maybe you won't.
Maybe you'll be taking a lot of punishment for a guy like me.
- Cambreau told you.
- No, Cambreau doesn't work that way.
But I took a look at the figures and they add up to one thing.
- Baby, it's me, ain't it?
- It's always been you.
That's what I figured.
Verne, are you sure?
Are you sure this is what you want?
- Don't you think it's the best way?
- I know it is.
Well, the best will always be good enough for us.
Hello, Verne.
- When do we sail, Grideau?
- Any minute, now that you're here.
So you found something stronger than you, after all.
Yeah, looks like it, don't it?
Where'd you get that dress?
Why, I bought it with the money you gave me on the boat.
- And what's it to you?
- Okay, okay.
Now that's what you need to keep a guy like me on the island.
Not something easy like a jungle, or an ocean,
- but something like her, tough.
- But won'th waiting for, maybe?
- As long as it takes.
- He wasrt talking to you.
Besides, I'm the one that'll be doing the waiting, not you.
- Okay to move around?
- Okay, Verne.
Or am I still a sucker?
What do you think?
- He won't be sorry?
- No, fisherman, he won't.
And everything will be all right for them someday?
Everything is all right now.
Goodbye, my friend.
Goodbye, monsieur.
There you are, lady.
- Is this seat occupied?
- Yes, please.
Well, that's too bad.
Would you mind removing your purse?
I'm sorry, but this place is taken.
I don't see anybody sitting here.
- You will in a minute.
- The nerve of some people.
- Is this chair taken, Miss?
- Yes, it is.
Sorry.
Oh, it's you.
- Then, it's not taken?
- Stop clowning, Michael. - Sit down.
- Thank you, Miss.
- You're late. What held you up?
- Something very important.
Drink your orange juice.
We haven't much time.
Oh, so you don't think it was important.
Alright, wait till you see the kitchen.
What kitchen?
What are you talking about?
Electric stove, refrigerator, washing machine, everything.
Even a special hole to dump garbage in.
Guess what else?
Whole wheat toast and orange marmalade, right?
Right, it's a table.
A real table on four legs with two chairs so that two people can sit, really see each other without wrenching their necks trying to catch a glimpse in the mirror behind the lunch counter.
That's what you were doing this morning?
Whole works is 60 a month.
What happened? Did you win the sweepstakes?
Better than that.
I got a $12 raise.
Michael,buthowcome?
If the girl I marry were interested in my career she'd have bought the New York Star and found out.
Let me see.
- "By Michael Ward."
- A byline.
See what it says?
"Star Reporter." That's me.
Think you can get a day off tomorrow? - Why?
- To get married.
I think I can manage.
Michael Ward, the key witness.
Two and a half columns.
Not bad, eh?
I didn't know he was so young.
He looks like a kid.
'Some of them start young.'
Do you really think he killed Nick?
Certainly.
I don't know, but...
I have a funny feeling.
'What? '
Somehow, I wish you'd never been near Nick's place that night.
What you talking about?
That's the break I've been waiting for.
If I hadn't, there'd be no story and we wouldn't be getting married.
- I know but..
- 'But what? '
Nothing, I...
I guess I'm just being silly.
It's becoming.
(male #1) 'Mmm, pass.'
(male #2) '260.'
(male #3) '290.'
Ah, why can't I get a decent hand?
- Buy?
- Spades trump.
You think he'll get the chair? - Who?
- Oh, these public defenders.
He should have pleaded him guilty.
At least, he'd have saved his life.
- Suppose he isn't guilty?
- What's the difference?
- He hasn't got a chance anyway. - That's it, fellas.
Well, I'll be.. - Well.
Well, look who's here? - Hello, boys.
As I live and breathe
Michael Ward, the shining light of journalism the boy who made good.
You wanna look neat. Makes a good impression on the jury.
Cut out the humor. - Hiya, Tom.
- Tell me, Mr. Ward.
How does it feel to hold center stage in this eternal drama? - Shut up.
- You don't like it?
- 'Bet he likes the raise.'
- You good for a fiver?
Never mind.
Have they started yet?
They'll wait for you.
You're the star of this show.
Kill that stuff, will you?
Don't mind them.
We're all excited you got a break.
Thanks, Martin.
Aren't you guys going in? What for?
We know how it's coming out.
- What makes you sure?
- What would they do?
Take a mug's word against a gentleman of the press?
What the devil are you talking about?
It isn't a question of my word against his.
It's what I saw with my own eyes. I was going home.
I looked into Nick's lunchroom to see if anyone I knew was there. - Well, did you see anyone?
- Yes, sir.
- Who was it?
- You mean, the defendant?
- 'Yes, sir.'
(lawyer) 'What was he doing? '
(Michael) 'Standing behind the counter near Nick' 'who was slumped over the register.'
(lawyer) 'What did you do? '
I ran into the place. As I went inside, I...saw Briggs look around and dashed towards the kitchen in the back.
- Did you follow him at once?
- No, I looked at Nick first. - Go on.
- It wasn't very nice.
His throat was cut.
Blood was still dripping into the open drawer of the cash register.
Well, what did you do then?
I ran into the kitchen, the back door was open
I looked into the alley, but Briggs was gone.
I went back and called the police.
You said you recognized the defendant.
- Where had you met him before? - At Nick's.
- When?
- Few days before he was killed.
Was at Nick's place when Briggs came and ordered some food.
(Mike) 'When Nick brought it..'
(lawyer) 'Go on.'
(Michael) 'Well, when Nick brought it' 'Briggs said he didn't have any money.'
'Nick told him to get out' 'he wasn't in business to feed deadbeats in New York.'
(lawyer) 'What did the defendant do? '
He grabbed Nick and shouted something like
"You wouldn't call me that if I had a gun in your ribs."
(lawyer) 'Then what happened? '
(Michael) 'Nick threatened to call the police.'
'I told Nick to leave him alone, I'd pay for his food.'
- You're a reporter, Mr. Ward? - Yes, sir.
As a newspaper reporter, you're a trained observer of men--
'I object.'
Eh, what?
I object to this line of questioning, Your Honor.
Oh...sustained.
(lawyer) 'Very well, one thing more.'
You have stated that you're absolutely certain this is the man you saw in Nick's on both occasions.
Now, be careful because on your answer may depend a man's life.
Are you absolutely positive he is the same man? - I am.
- That's all.
Your witness.
You said you saw the defendant standing beside the body of the lunchroom proprietor? Yes, sir.
But did you see him actually commit the murder?
- No, I didn't.
- That's all.
I wouldn't let him defend me if it was for stealing an apple.
Thanks for that cup of coffee.
(judge) 'Your next witness.' (clerk) 'Dr...
Dr. Charles Evans.'
Jane, what are you doing here? I felt a little upset.
The boss let me go home. - I came here instead.
- You shouldn't have.
(clerk) 'Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth..'
Do you think they will convict him? - I don't know.
They might.
- Shh! Quiet, please.
- 'You are a police surgeon?
' - 'Yes, sir.'
- You examined Nick Narbajan? - Yes, sir.
How long would you say he had been dead when you arrived there?
About a half an hour.
And what in your opinion was the cause of death?
A sharp instrument, either a knife or a razor wielded I'd say with a great deal of violence.
The head was almost severed from the body.
So you want this jury to believe that you went back to Nick's just to repay a debt of thirty cents? Yes sir, that's the truth.
Mr. Ward was nice to me, and I wanted to pay him back.
That's all I went there for.
How did you know you'd find him there?
Well, I took a chance.
That's where I'd met him.
He wasn't there when you went in, was he?
No.
What did Nick say to you as you entered? Well, he didn't say nothin'.
He was dead.
What did you do then?
Open the cash register? - No, I didn't.
It was open. - How much money did you take?
I didn't take no money.
I didn't need any.
I worked that day, and I made almost five dollars.
Well, why then..
- Your Honor. - Eh?
Yes, yes.
(judge) 'Jury number two.'
The jury will pay strict attention to the evidence. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I was up all night with a terrible toothache.
Well, that's too bad.
'But it's your duty to stay awake.' And try and follow the evidence with as much intelligence as you've got.
All they want is to get it over with, go home.
You said you didn't go there to rob. Why didn't you call the police instead of running away? I was scared.
I didn't want to get mixed up in it.
So scared that you ran back to your room to pack your bag.
You were packing your bag when you were arrested, right? - Yes, sir.
- Why?
Well, I-I don't know.
- I-I was panicky. - I'll tell you why.
This is not the first time you committed a crime, is it?
Why did you lie about that previous conviction?
That was a mistake.
(lawyer) 'You forgot that fingerprints will always give you away.'
'You served three years in the Ohio State Reformatory' 'for the holdup of a gasoline station at Lima, didn't you? '
Yes, sir...but I was a kid.
I only took five dollars.
There must have been at least 50 there.
If that man at the filling station had fought you'd have killed him as you killed Nick.
No, sir, and I didn't kill Nick.
I swear I didn't.
I didn't kill him.
What's the matter, Jane?
I just couldn't stand listening to him.
I know, it's always pretty awful.
But suppose, for just one minute that he's telling the truth. You're just upset.
Everybody is at their first trial.
No, it isn't that.
It's you.
If they convict him, it'll be on your testimony. What should I do, lie?
I had to tell them what I saw.
Oh, Michael, why did you have to be there that night?
Pull yourself together, darling.
I've got to call the office then we'll look at the apartment. - No, not today.
- But they might rent it.
- We'll find another place.
Wait right here, and we'll go out and get a cup of coffee.
- Hello, Martin.
Will you tell Michael that I've gone home?
- Alright, sure. - Thanks.
I'll wait for the verdict. Sure, I'll call right away.
- Where are you going?
- To the drug store with Jane.
- She said, she had to go home.
A little family row? No. She got upset by the trial.
Well, that happens.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
[typewriter keys clacking]
Funny part is, she acts as if I were responsible for the whole thing. Well, maybe you are.
If you hadn't seen him, he'd never be caught.
What was I to do?
Take it easy, you did the right thing.
He didn't do it and he gets the chair?
Suppose they do? What difference will it make?
Too many people in the world anyway.
What's the use of talking to you?
- You think everything's a joke.
- My son, it is.
If it weren't, life wouldn't be worth living. Mine host, two more of the same.
(bartender) 'Two more.
Yes, sir.'
No, thanks.
Not for me.
Got to get back to the courtroom.
That's a good boy.
Go in there and earn your raise.
(male #4) 'All rise, the Justice of the court.'
Be seated.
The defendant will rise and face the jury.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Have you reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
We find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. No!
- Come on, son. - NO!
I didn't do it. I-I didn't do it.
Let me go.
Let me go!
Mr. Ward.
You know I didn't do it.
- 'Come on.' - 'Nick was dead, Ward.' [dramatic music]
What's the matter, Mike?
Didn't you like the verdict?
That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Well, so long.
Yes, Michael.
I-I got awfully tired.
What was the verdict?
I knew it.
Well, it's over, anyway.
What say we go to Tony's?
No, Michael, I don't feel like going out tonight.
I-I want to be alone.
I'm tired.
Oh, I can't.
I can't forget it. What do you know about law and trials and all those things.
Odds are million to one that boy's guilty.
It doesn't make any difference, Michael.
He'll be with us the rest of our lives.
(Jane) 'I'll always hear his voice.'
Jane. Jane.
[hangs up phone]
Oh, excuse me, I thought you all had gone already. Oh, that's alright.
I'm going now.
(Briggs) I didn't do it. I didn't.
[thinking] What's the matter with me? I'm getting soft.
Hedidit .
Of course,hedid.
(Jane) 'Suppose for just one minute that he's telling the truth?
' [thinking] What if she's right?
Afterall,Ididn'tsee Briggs actually kill Nick.
Alltherestoftheevidence was circumstantial too. Sowhat?
Thatdoesn't make it less reliable.
Ifthecourtshad tohave an eyewitness for everything nobodywouldeverbeconvicted.
Butsometimestheydo get the wrong man.
Whydidhe havetohave a criminal record? Now,they'llhave to give him the chair.
He'lldie,andI'll never know for sure.
Businessasusual.
Allyouhavetodo is repaint the sign. PutJackinsteadofNick andthey'lldrinktheircoffee as though nothing had happened.
Paper, Mr. Ward?
[thinking] Why did I have to live across the street?
LotofpeopleliveinBrooklyn. Why couldn't I?
ThenI wouldn'tbe mixed up in it.
Whycan'ttheyput in a bigger lamp?
Listentohimsnore. [snoring continues]
[door closes] [thinking] It'll be a big day in my life when I move out of here.
She'llforgetallaboutit in a couple of days.
HowI hatedoingthis every night?
Twoyears,Idon 'tknow how I stood it.
Withthatsnoringanimal next door.
Hewascertainlyeasy to spot.
I'llneverforget the way we met.
- Mr. Ward.
What's the idea of breaking in?
Mr. Meng can't sleep, with you pounding on that machine. I have some work.
It's only ten.
People who don't loaf all day don't have to work nights. This isn't an office building.
That's right.
It's a rooming house. Exactly!
I've paid my rent, and I'll do as I please.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Mr. Meng's been living here nearly 14 years and always paid his rent promptly. - Every week.
- So do I.
Yes, but you won't live here 14 years.
Heaven forbid.
But as long as you do live here, stop using that thing.
Come, Mr. Meng.
If you have to write, write with a pencil.
[thinking] I am tired.
Who'sthat?
Itisn'tMeng.
Looking for somebody?
What do you want?
Who are you? Hey, wait a minute.
[thinking] Where the devil did he go?
WhydoIcare?
Whatwashe doinginhere ? Washetrying to rob the place?
Can'tbeverybright.
Thereisn'tanythingworth stealing in the whole block.
Whatanevilface.
HeandMeng would make a swell team.
Meng,heisn'tsnoring.
He must be awake.
Maybeheheard that man in the hall.
Butwhyis he so quiet?
Is there something wrong?
Thatman..
...maybehedidsomething to him, maybe he killed him.
What'sthematterwithme?
I'm acting like an old woman.
(lawyer) 'You forgot that fingerprints will always give you away.'

AndwhydidIbelieve Briggs was guilty? Butthatwasdifferent.
Hesaidhimselfhe'dkill Nick if he only had a gun.
I'veneversaidanything like that.
Oh,yes,Ihave.
Thattimein Nick's..
Everything very special, just as you like it, Mr. Ward. Thanks, Nick. How's tricks?
Oh, everything is fine, thanks.
Thanks. How is the newspaper business?
- Fine, fine, thanks.
- That's good.
- Another cup of java, Nick.
- Great character.
- An artist.
You know, it isn't every dope can make a cup of coffee like this.
It's a big secret.
But I like you girls so much, I tell you how.
You see, I put a raisin in each cup of coffee to make it sweet like you. [girls giggle]
- Good evening, Mr. Meng. - Good evening.
Good evening.
One of my best customers.
I'll have a bottle of milk, my friend.
- Milk?
- A bottle of milk, please.
- Shall I wrap it up?
- No, thank you.
Oh!
- Oh, look, a runner. - Oh.
- Who is that citizen?
He looks as though his mind would stand a little laundering.
Hello, neighbor.
Uh-ha, shouldn't drink coffee before going to bed. Milk's the thing.
Makes you sleep like an innocent babe.
Goodnight.
Did you ever want to kill a man?
My son, there's murder in every intelligent man's heart. He's no man.
He's a worm.
Kind you ought to jump on with heavy boots. You'll have to do an awful lot of jumping.
The Earth is covered with them.
It would be a real pleasure to cut his throat.
Say, you're not kidding. Put down that knife.
[thinking] But it was just talk, just something you say.
Youcan'tconvict a man on that.
Ineverycrime, there has to be a motive.
Ihadn'tany.
Waita minute.
Howaboutlastmonth, the night it rained?
Are you sure it's alright for me to come up here?
Certainly, I was never told not to have friends in my room.
I like your room.
It's very nice.
I-I liked it, didn't you?
Mm-hmm.
You're face is wet.
Thank you.
I'm glad I came up.
I have the rain to thank for that.
- I've always liked the rain. - I do too.
The park was wet and damp tonight.
It's snug and warm here. - I'm tired of the park.
- Me too.
I'm tired of the movies.
They're so dark I can never see your face.
I'm tired of the bus tops even in spring.
- I hate Riverside Drive.
- So do I.
I hate every place.. ...where I can't take you in my arms.
I've always wanted to see your room.
To know where you sit when you're tired and where you sleep.
- Do you talk in your sleep? - I don't know.
I've always lived alone.
Telling your secrets to the walls. 'Maybe.'
Darling...your shoes are soaking wet.
You'll catch cold.
Your stockings too.
You better take them off.
I'll get you something to dry them with.
- I don't know.
Go and see.
- 'Me, Mrs. Kane.'
What do you want?
Mr. Meng says you've got a woman.
What if I have?
It's against the rules of the house.
'You oughta know better.'
There she is. Look at her legs.
I'm surprised at you, Mr. Ward.
I made it quite clear that ladies aren't allowed.
- You said nothing. - I did.
'I tell all my tenants.
Get her out of here.'
Yes, this is a respectable house.
Get out of here.
Both of you, before I throw you out.
Don't you dare.
I'll call the police.
Please, Michael, don't argue with them.
Don't worry, I'll go at once.
Oh, no, you won't.
You won't leave because of this obscene, old fool.
- Take your hands off me.
- Mrs. Kane.
- Michael.
- Mr. Ward! - Let him go please.
Get him out of here before I kill him.
Alright.
You heard him, you heard him.
You saw him assault me. - You're my witness.
- Alright, alright.
I'm sorry, darling. Terribly sorry.
I don't care.
I really don't.
They can't hurt me.
I should've known this would happen.
He's always spying on me.
He had his ear glued to the wall the minute we came up.
Forget it darling, please.
She never told me I wasn't to have you up. Of course, she didn't.
Look, it stopped raining.
I love the smell of the park after the rain.
Don't you?
I love the park anyway and the movies and Riverside Drive.
- Jane, why do you love me?
- What makes you think I do?
- Just a hunch.
Let's go, Michael, before they come back again.
You're right, let's.
- Nothing.
- Why bother? - What do you mean?
Hmm, nothing I just thought that in a few weeks, we both might move.
Darling? What's the matter?
Don't you like the idea?
Why didn't I think of that?
- Why didn't you think of what?
- Of getting married.
Michael, you really never did?
Not because I'm bashful.
I just could never figure out what we'd live on.
That doesn't matter. I can wait.
- You will?
- Forever..
- ...if necessary. - It won't be that long.
One of these days, I'll get a break.
I got mine tonight. [orchestral music]
[thinking] Poor, Jane, they'll drag her into it.
ButMengisn'tdead.
What'sthematterwithme?
I'mjusttired.
Ican'tthink straight anymore.
IfI couldonlydriveit outta my mind.. ...andgetsome...sleep.
(male #5) Wake up.
(male #6) Why did you do it? Speak up.
Why did you kill him? Come on.
Come clean.
Confess, and we'll go easy on you.
- I didn't. - Stop lying.
- You know you killed him.
- I didn't.
The stranger did it.
The man in the hall. - Where'd ya hide the gun?
- I never had a gun.
Where did you put the knife?
- What knife? - This one.
'You thought we wouldn't find it, eh?
I didn't. I didn't.
(paperboy) Extra, extra.
Read all about it.
Has he got a byline now? ' (reporter #2) 'How'd you know he did it?
'
Who cares.
What a story!
What a story!
Oh, Michael, why did you do it?
I didn't do it, Jane.
I didn't.
It was that man I saw.
Nobody believes me.
But you do, don't you?
Do you?
- Michael, you're hurting me.
I'm to defend you at your trial, but I must know the truth.
[laughs]
That's what they all say.
Now, here is my advice.
Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court. - I won't do it.
- Don't be a fool.
You want to get the chair like Briggs?
I won't admit something I didn't do.
Somebody on that jury will believe me.
Oh, yeah?
[laughs]
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The state will prove that the defendant, Michael Ward deliberately, willfully, intentionally and with malice of forethought murdered Albert Meng on the night of May 17. - But I didn't.
- The defendant will refrain.
He has a vicious temper.
Always picking fights.
Once, he almost struck me.
But it isn't true.
- I object.
- The defendant will refrain.
Sit down.
I heard with my own ears what he told Mr. Meng when he asked him to get his lady friend out of his room.
And what did he tell Mr. Meng?
He told him, "You'll be sorry for this.
I'm going to kill you."
(Michael) 'But I didn't. She is lying.'
The defendant will refrain.
Keep your mouth shut.
[dramatic music]
(clerk) 'Do you realize you're under oath to tell the truth' 'the whole truth and nothing but the truth? ' I do.
Did he say it before, "I'll kill him?"
I-I don't remember.
Would you swear he didn't say it?
Would you? Would you?
! No.
[sobbing]
I'm sorry, Michael.
I had to tell the truth.
You hated Meng, didn't you? Yes, but I didn't kill him.
Did you ever think of killing him?
I don't know.
I might have.
[laughs]
No, it isn't.
I'm telling you I didn't do it.
Ladies and gentlemen, you're the jury. Please believe me, I'm innocent.
There was a man in the hall.
A stranger, he..
Why aren't you listening to me?
They are not listening.
Make them hear me, they've got to.
The defendant will refrain.
I didn't kill him, I didn't.
- I didn't, I didn't.
- Order in the court.
(Michael) 'You can't convict me.
I didn't kill him, I didn't.'
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict?
I'm not guilty.
The stranger killed him.
There he is.
Why don't you do something?
He'll get away. Arrest him.
Michael Ward...face the court.
It is the judgment of this court that you be taken to the state prison 'and be there...
put to death' 'in the manner prescribed by law.'
And may God...have mercy on your soul.
I'm not afraid to die.
Even though I don't know why I have to.
But before I do I've got to know there's someone on this earth who does believe I'm innocent.
You're the last man I'll ever talk to.
Please say you don't believe I killed him. [laughs]
Now, you're looking for somebody to believe you. To say you ain't done it. Why should they?
Did you believe me?
Would you tell me you didn't think I done it?
No.
Ha ha!
Okay, kid, go and die.
(priest) '...thy name, thy kingdom come.'
'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.'
'Give us this day our daily bread' 'and forgive us our trespasses' 'as we forgive those who trespass against us.'
'And lead us not into temptation' 'but deliver us from evil.'
My, my, quite an occasion, isn't it?
Look, look, he's alive.
I told you not to drink coffee before going to bed.
That proves I didn't kill him!
Let me go! Let me go!
Can't you see he's alive?
Let me go! He's alive! He's alive!
He's alive!
He's alive.
But why don't I hear him?
- Jane, listen.
Get dressed and meet me in the park.
I can't now.
I'll tell you when I see you.
It's terribly important.
Bring all the money you have with you.
Yes, hurry.
Please, Jane.
I've got to leave town at once.
The minute they find the body, I'll be arrested.
But, Michael, pull yourself together.
Nobody's going to arrest you.
- Why should they?
- I've told you why.
Doesn't make sense. Besides, where will you go?
They'll find you no matter where you hide.
It's only chance I've got.
Did you bring any money?
Michael don't you realize it'll only make things worse for you?
Why don't you try to figure it out first?
Are you even sure that Meng's dead?
Of course, I'm sure.
Nobody can live with his throat slashed open like..
- His throat. - What is it, Michael?
- It was cut just like Nick's.
- What are you talking about?
Nick on the corner, don't you remember?
He was killed the same way.
The same way.
The same man killed them both, I tell ya.
- The same man?
- It must be.
Couldn't have been anybody else. Then you think that boy is innocent?
Of course, he is.
Ah, but what's the use?
I can't prove it.
They'll convict me just like they did him.
Can't you see, Jane, I've gotta get away.
And let Briggs die when you know he's innocent?
What can I do?
I can't help him.
Yes, you can.
You can help the police find the man you saw.
A lot you know about cops!
They won't even listen to me.
They will, they've got to.
Alright.
If that's what you want me to do.
- Where are you going?
- I live here.
You can't go in now. There's been a guy killed.
I know I called the police.
Well, that's different.
Come on, the lieutenant wants to see you. - What do you say, doc?
- Death was instantaneous.
- The jugular vein was cut.
- How long ago?
Oh, I'd say about six hours.
This guy here says he sent in the call.
- Hello, lieutenant.
- Hello, Ward.
- You found the body?
- Yeah. Do you live in there?
Yeah, that's my room.
Any leads so far?
Nothing much. They're checking for fingerprints now.
- What do you know about it?
But I've got a slant that might help you.
A man was hanging around last night when I came home.
Maybe he was visiting somebody.
Maybe.
But when I spoke to him, he ran.
He did, huh?
Well, thanks, Ward.
It's a lead anyway.
Here's another one.
- Remember Nick?
- Sure. His throat was cut the same way.
- That's right.
I don't think it was a coincidence.
- You don't, huh?
- What do you think?
Well, I think--
Don't you think we'd better let the DA know?
A fellow was convicted for the other murder yesterday.
I guess so...if we can get him outta bed.
Amazing..
...almost incredibly so.
Have you men out to pick up this fellow he saw?
Yes, sir, I have.
- No sign of him yet, I suppose?
Not so far. I see.
Well, sit down while I shave.
In the meantime, something's got to be done about Briggs.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Now, uh, let me get this straight.
You said that, uh, you had a...premonition.. ...that Meng was dead right after you ran into that queer-looking customer in the hall.
Yes, sir.
Hmm, extraordinary.
We could use a few men with a gift like that on the police force, eh, lieutenant?
Why didn't you do something about it?
It was only a vague feeling I had.
What made it less vague later on?
I had a nightmare, I told you.
Mm-hmm, you must be psychic.
Do you, uh, often have such nightmares?
No, I don't.
I didn't get you outta bed to talk about my dreams.
What's gonna be done about Briggs?
Why are you so worried about him?
Because I helped you convict him.
Yes, that's true.
You were the only witness.
So now you believe both murders were committed by the same man, eh?
Yes, I do.
Um...maybe you're right.
As you pointed out, there are certain similarities between the two crimes.
But you missed one.
Perhaps, the most important.
Both murders were discovered by the same man.
You.
What are you driving at?
Tell me...has there ever been any insanity in your family?
Listen, I'm as sane as you are and if you think I had anything to do with it, you're crazy.
'I tell you, it was that man I saw.'
Might be...but for your sake, Ward.
What do you mean?
Better take him down to headquarters with you. - Material witness.
- Come along.
Congratulations.
You'll be governor yet.
And thanks for your order of..
'Uh, where was I? '
"And thanks for your order of.."
Ah, you better make that thank you instead of thanks.
Say, what's the matter with you this morning?
'You look like you wasn't here.'
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. McClain.
Hello, Michael.
Arrested.
But why?
Can't they find that man?
Well, why aren't they looking?
Oh, I see.
Yes, I do.
More than ever.
I-I'll come up as soon as they'll let me see you.
Please, Mr. McClain. Can I have the rest of the day off? Ha ha.
What, again?
I'm sorry, Mr. McClain, but something terrible has happened.
- Won't you let me go, please.
- Well, what can I do?
- 'Thanks, Mr. McClain.'
- Alright.
Thank you very much.
What can I do for you?
I got some very nice, fresh bananas today.
No, thanks. Uh, tell me.
You must know nearly everybody around this neighborhood. Oh, sure.
And they all know me.
Honest waiter Giuseppe, that's what they call me.
Well, maybe you can help me find this man I'm looking for.
- A man.
What's his name?
- I-I don't know.
You don't know?
What does he look like?
I don't know that either.
I-I never saw him.
All I know is he-he has big protruding eyes and he wears a funny-looking long white scarf.
And you never saw him?
- I never did either.
- Thanks.
- Thick lips. - 'Yes.' - Bulgy eyes.
Never saw a guy like that.
How about you, Tony?
- Me neither.
Thank you.
- Please.
Do you know a-a strange-looking man.
He has big bulgy eyes and...thick lips and-and he wears a long white scarf.
- What's his name?
- Oh, I don't know.
Sorry, lady, but people are just names to me.
Sometimes, I think what this or that name looks like but I never thought of anybody that looked like that.
Thanks.
- I'm sorry, dear.
- Thank you.
Sorry, lady.
- A cup of coffee please.
- Yes, Miss.
Have you seen a man who..
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I asked you that before.
Here you are, Miss.
- Catch up with that fellow yet? - No.
[door creaks]
That's too bad.
Yes, sir.
What's it gonna be?
I want a couple of hamburgers, and I'd like them raw.
Two hamburgers raw.
Out of style.
Ha ha ha.
(waiter) 'Kinda like the taste of blood, eh? ' No, thank you.
I don't care for the buns. Just put them in some paper please, I..
I want to take them with me.
Okay, 20 cents.
Now, here you are, you poor little devil.
Now, don't eat too fast. You'll get a tummy ache, you.
He followed me for two blocks.
'I had to give him something to eat.'
Why are you looking at me like that?
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I'm afraid I made a mistake.
For a minute, I-I thought you were someone I knew.
Oh, that's alright. He's awfully cute.
I-I wish I could but...
I have no home to give him.
Well..
Goodnight, you.
What do you want?
Why are you following me?
Oh, I-I was going in-in the same direction and I-I thought maybe I could walk with you.
- Well, uh.. It's so late an-and so dark I..
Yes, it is dark.
Come along.
I'll see that nothing happens to you.
[music continues] It's this neighborhood that frightens me.
So many terrible things have happened here.
What things?
Haven't you.. Haven't you heard what happened up there in number 39?
- They send you to take me back?
Don't you know?
The people who lock you up.
Of course, not.
- How do I know I can trust you?
They-they wouldn't send a woman, would they?
No.
No, they-they wouldn't send a woman.
The only person who ever was kind to me was a woman.
- She's dead now.
Why? Why do they wanna lock you up?
Oh, so they can hurt me.
They.. They put you in a shirt with, uh..
...long sleeves and.. ...they pour ice water on you.
Oh, that's terrible.
Did-did Nick wanna send you back to them?
Yes, he did.
How do you know?
- Did Meng try to do it too?
- Meng? Who is Meng?
You know, the man up there in the house.
Oh, that man. Oh, he said he was going to report me.
I-I had to kill him.
What's the matter?
I-I live in here.
Goodnight.
It was very nice.
Don't go.
I-I haven't got my key.
I have to ring the bell.
Please, wait till I get in.
Ha, they must be all asleep.
I guess so.
[buzzing] - What do you want?
- Please let me in.
- I've got to call the police.
- You're drunk. Waking up people this hour of the night.
Get out of here, or I'll call the police.
- Why did you lie?
I..
I just made a mistake. The houses are all alike around here.
Mine must be next door.
No.
You don't live next door.
You don't live here at all.
- You live there with them.
- No. No, I don't.
[breathing heavily] I'm your friend.
- Why are you afraid of me?
- I'm not. I'm not afraid.
They sent you becau-because they know I would trust a woman.
Help!
Please let me in!
Let me go!
I'll not go back there.
'Help!
It's not my fault, Miss.
I couldn't help it.
I honked.
You can't stop one of these things in five feet.
You'll be a witness for me, won't you?
- Say.. - What happened?
- It wasn't my fault.
- Call an ambulance. - Sure.
- He went right in front of it.
- She saw him.
- Is that right?
Yes.
He-he was chasing me.
He was going to kill me.
He looks like the guy we were looking for this morning.
Yes, he is, and-and he admitted everything.
He killed 'em both.
- Did you?
- Yes.
But I'm not going back.
- Is this place taken, Miss?
- Yes, it is.
- I beg your pardon.
- Sit down.
- Thank you, Miss.
- Where were you? - You're late again.
- Oh, I-- Whole wheat toast and orange marmalade, right?
Wrong.
Wrong? It's what I serve you every morning.
- That isn't what I want.
- That's what you always have.
Never again.
From now on, I'm switching to eggs. Cooked by my own wife. In her own kitchen.
Phil, you've lost two customers.
- Is that so?
Congratulations.
- Right. - Right.
Come on.
Where are we going?
The judge and the DA are waiting for us.
Michael, is something wrong again?
Not if this marriage license is okay.
- City hall.
We aren't going to start our life together like that.
From now on, we stay.
That's alright, lady.
This one's on the house.
- Hello, how are you? - Fine.
[orchestral music]
- How's it going, Joe?
- Okay.
Fill her up.
- What are you hauling?
- Apples.
- How's your brother, Paul?
- Asleep.
Every time you come here, he's asleep and you're driving.
- What is he, a growing boy? - He drives as much as I do.
You run your station, we'll take care of our rig.
I was just wondering.
This is the nearest I've had to a bath in two weeks.
Yeah, I noticed.
Seventy gallons of gas, three quarts of oil in your crankcase...
- I'll have to get you on the way back.
- Five quarts in your spare...
What did you say?
I can't pay till I drop off this load.
- Why didn't you say that?
- You wouldn't have given me the gas.
I'll say. I got a notion to siphon it out of there.
You know I ain't selling gas on time.
Relax. I wouldn't gyp you. I'm honest.
I know you are. All you truckers are honest, but you're always broke.
The finance company comes, you're out of business, and I never see dough.
Don't worry. He's gotta catch me first.
That won't be tough, you ain't driving any speedway special.
Sign it. - Twelve dollars and 90 cents.
- Don't overflow your tank.
On the cuff.
How do you like that?
- You'll get it on the trip back.
- You didn't pay for this pop.
Put it on the bill.
- Where are we?
- Not far from Lansdale.
- You should have woke me up.
We'll grab a cup of coffee at Barney's.
Then you can wheel it into Los Angeles.
How's about laying over at my house for a couple of days?
I'd like to stay in bed for a week, not even get up to eat.
So would I.
But that ain't the way we get ahead.
I gotta think of Pearl. I ain't been home for two weeks.
She might as well be married to an explorer.
You dirty son of a road hog!
- You should've smacked into him.
- What is that gonna get us?
What do we do now?
You watch the load, I'm gonna hop up to Barney's and phone Williams. And see if he'll send some of the dough he owes us.
Hello, Joe.
Where's your rig?
- Down the road.
Busted wheel.
- Oh, tough going. Can I help?
I'm gonna phone Williams to send the dough he owes me.
I hope you get it. I quit hauling for that crook.
Ran me ragged and I hardly ever got paid.
He'll pay me now, or he won't get his apples in L.A. On time.
You got him over a barrel, that's different.
Maybe you'll get it. - Come on.
We go.
- Yeah, he's right.
Can't make no dough drinking coffee.
Good luck, guy.
- Same to you.
Oh, Harry! Write your wife.
I hear she's worried.
- Give me a Frisco phone book, will you? - Yeah.
Be sure you bring back all the pages too.
So I'm telling you, see here I am with these two beautiful dames. What equipment.
They're hanging around my neck, begging me not to go.
I tell them, "Look, sisters, I got a job to do".
So I push them away and leave.
After all, a guy like me with hundreds of dames...
I'm getting out of here.
Come on, Shorty. It's too deep for me.
I'm losing my touch.
Give me some nickels, Barney.
Joe!
Where you been, guy? Been getting any good hauls?
Some. How they been for you, Irish?
I still get my check every Saturday.
But you get ordered around every other day. Ain't for me.
Hey, Red, this steak's tough.
You can't send it back now. You bent it.
- I'll be back this way tonight, Red.
- Thanks for the warning.
Give me the phone, will you?
- What, you keep it in a vault?
- Don't call New York.
Another cup of java.
- You must like our coffee.
- It stinks.
You're drinking your seventh cup.
I like your sugar.
Why don't you and your brother quit wildcat trucking?
With a legitimate company, this is a swell job.
Why don't you get smart like me and work for Ed Carlsen?
- Give me long distance.
Relax, I'm reversing the charges.
There's only one guy I'd sooner work for than Carlsen.
- Who?
- Me.
You ain't working for you, you're working for the finance company.
Soon as your truck's paid for, you'll need another one.
Hello? I wanna talk to Mike Williams.
Standard 7-2961, San Francisco.
Reverse the charges.
Joe Fabrini calling.
Don't worry about me.
Someday you road-skinners will say, "Joe Fabrini's a good guy to work for". - And I will be.
- No doubt about that, kid, but me I'll take the salary and let someone else worry.
That's the easy way.
Give me a cup of coffee.
- Anything else?
- What else you got that ain't poisonous?
I don't know. I never eat here.
- How about taking my order, Red?
- How about taking your time?
Nice new fixture, Barney.
Yeah.
She'll do.
Not a bad thing to know.
Nice chassis, huh, Joe?
Classy chassis.
Yes, and it's all mine too. I don't owe any payments on it.
I'd be glad to finance it, baby.
Who are you kidding? You couldn't even pay for the headlights.
What?
He won't accept the call? Wait a minute.
Lend me a buck, I wanna pay for the call.
Get a load of the big trucking operator.
I still vote for a salary.
Okay. I'll pay for it at this end.
This is 2212.
Anything else?
Yeah, but it ain't on the menu.
And it ain't gonna be. You better settle for a hamburger.
Okay. With onions.
Hello, Mike Williams?
What's the idea of ducking my phone call?
I never take collect calls.
Where are you?
Barney's café, north of Lansdale, 99.
You got a busted wheel?
Look, Fabrini, those apples have gotta be delivered to the market tonight.
- That ain't wood you're hauling.
- Okay, I'll get the apples in but send me some of that 300 bucks you owe me so I can get a new wheel.
Yeah, wire it to me, right here.
Well, I ain't got much cash right now, Joe.
All right, all right, don't get excited.
I'll see what I can do.
Who do those Fabrini guys think they are, anyhow?
I've thrown more business their way than any freight agent in town...
- ...and I ain't sending money.
- The apples won't get to L.A.
They will if somebody else hauls them.
Who's up there near Lansdale?
Hank Dawson.
He's due there and we don't owe him much money.
You get him on the phone and tell him to pick up Fabrini's load.
Those Fabrinis are tough babies.
They only think they're tough.
Say, is Farnsworth still outside?
- He was a minute ago.
- Tell that loan shark I wanna see him.
But you fellas don't understand.
Everything I do is within the law.
All I can say is, we need a lot of new laws.
Hey, the boss wants to talk to you.
Bye-bye, buzzard.
What's the matter with the man?
Tell me, Farnsworth, do the Fabrinis owe you any dough on that truck?
I've been trying to catch them.
They're behind three payments, plus my interest.
I know all about your interest. Would you like to repossess the truck?
- Yeah, certainly.
- Here's your chance.
They're stuck with a busted wheel near Barney's café on 99.
- Get a tow car and haul in the rig. - Thanks.
I'll do you a favor sometime.
Just don't lend me any money. That's all I ask of you.
- What are you doing here?
- I got blisters waiting so I hitched to Lansdale and got a secondhand wheel.
Told the guy I'd get the dough.
- What about the load?
- Got a kid watching it.
- How'd you make out with Williams?
- I'm still waiting for the dough.
Why do we stay in this racket?
We aren't gonna make enough to buy ourselves decent coffins.
Stop crabbing. I got enough worries.
Get that into you. We gotta start rolling.
All right, that's enough of the x-ray treatment.
Don't get me wrong, sister.
All you make me think about is how much I'd like to be with my wife.
First time I've ever heard that one.
- I ain't got a wife.
- That's not hard to understand. If any of you guys owe on your trucks, you better fade.
Farnsworth's coming.
- Where's Fabrini?
- With Byrd, at the South Pole.
Fishing with the president.
I heard he was playing left end for Notre Dame.
It ain't nothing personal. He bought a truck and he's gotta pay. Why?
Everything on that pile makes noise except the horn.
I'm standing on my legal rights!
I gotta make a living too.
- Why?
- Because it says in the law...
I ain't gonna argue with you fellas. Miss, did you see Joe Fabrini around?
I know he's been here.
- He pulled out more than an hour ago.
- Yeah? Whose wheel is that outside?
It's mine. - Wanna make anything out of it?
Listen, runt, we don't like you around here.
Thanks, honey.
I'll do you a favor sometime.
That's all right, I don't like them either.
They got a coat of mine once.
- How much do we owe for the chow?
- Thirty-six.
- Here you are.
Keep the change.
- Thanks.
It's all right. He's on his way.
- Thanks, fellas.
I'll be seeing you.
- Where's the wheel?
- Right over there.
If we're lucky, maybe we can get a ride.
Who's this?
Hi, Dawson. - Hello.
How are you, Joe? - Hello. Will you give us a lift?
- We had some trouble.
- Williams told me. - Williams?
He sent me here to pick up your load.
That dirty muzzler.
We carry the load all this way and we don't get a dime.
- Suppose we don't give it to you.
- You can suit yourself but if you miss market, you'll take a rap for the whole load.
- Yeah, just let him try to collect.
- Shut up.
Of course he'll collect, out of the dough he owes us.
You're a nice guy, Dawson. - Why do you pull stuff like this?
- It ain't my fault, Joe.
I got a wife and a kid and another one on the way.
I gotta do what Williams says, or I don't get no hauls.
- Don't get sore at me.
- I'd like to kick that chiseler's teeth out.
That ain't gonna get you nothing, and besides, Hank ain't interested.
Let's hop in.
- Give us a hand, will you?
Our rig's about two miles down the road.
And where do we go from there?
We better go back to Frisco and see Williams.
By the time I get home to my wife I'll be too tired to turn out the light.
Come on, Williams ought to be in his office by now.
What if he don't see it?
What do you think?
No loads yet. Hang around.
What do you think we been doing?
Tell Williams we want to see him.
You guys again? You heard me say there ain't any loads.
Who said we wanted any? We don't get paid for them anyway.
Oh, hello, boys.
How'd you get back?
What's the difference?
We should wrap a crank around you.
We got a hunch it was you put Farnsworth on our tail.
What did I want to see you boys lose your truck for?
I got some beer hauls in mind for you, something coming up soon.
Beer's out, you bring back the empties.
Three hauls a week, how'd you like that?
- We'd like it fine if we got paid.
- You been horsing around enough. We ought to break your neck for leaving us stuck then lifting our load.
What, you want me to dig into my pocket every time you fold a wheel or blow a tire?
- I'm just as broke as you are. - What is this, tin?
Here, here, here. Where's your manners, anyhow?
Going into a man's papers.
You owe us 300 bucks and you're gonna pay us now!
- If you don't...! - All right! Don't get hot.
- What'll we do, use it for a tire patch?
We'll take it out of here.
Cash.
Let go of him, Paul, and write out a receipt.
You know, there's a law against taking people's money.
That was so, you'd have been in the clink years ago.
I knew you'd see it our way.
You mark my words, you guys are gonna regret this.
We're tired of taking chances and leaving you the dough.
That's the worst of you road slobs! Always getting too big for your britches! But I don't mind telling you one thing:
This is the last load you'll ever get here.
In that case, we haven't got anything to lose, have we?
There's your receipt.
There's a bad curve sitting out front. It's got mud on it. Be careful.
Go to sleep, will you? I'm driving now.
I was just reminding you.
If we go over a cliff, wake me up.
Pour on the brakes.
If we stop and pick up everybody we see on the road we ain't gonna get in till next week.
It's a dame.
It won't hurt to get her out of the rain.
It's too bad one of them hotshot passenger cars couldn't give her a lift.
Come on, hop in.
I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever get a ride.
Well, you got one now, so relax.
You're the dame that was slinging hash at Barney's.
- That's me. - Well, what happened?
Barney had about 12 hands, and I didn't like any of them.
You didn't have to pass him 100 times a day. - It was like tangling with an octopus.
- How far you going?
- How far are you going?
- We're going to L.A.
That's okay by me. I'd just as soon be out of a job one place as another.
Wait a minute.
I better wrap you up.
- What's your name, Red?
- Cassie Hartley.
You know anyone in L. A?
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Get a room, look for work.
Jobs ain't growing on bushes these days.
- How much dough you got?
- Enough to get by.
You're gonna lose your teeth chattering if we don't get something hot into you.
Pull into Mandel's, Paul. We've been rolling pretty good.
Pearl's waiting up for me. I was going to spend an hour with her.
So you'll spend a half-hour with her.
Oh, look. It's clearing up.
We'll be all right.
Don't stop on my account.
We gotta stop, it might as well be Mandel's.
That ain't home.
Pearl can't cook a steak like Billy Mandel.
I ain't interested in steaks.
How come you're here? Ain't you behind schedule?
I've been having tough luck.
I won 48 free games.
I tried to shoot them, but I kept winning. Only three games and then I roll.
And I'll have to push my foot through the floorboard to make up my schedule.
What will it be, boys?
A T-bone, rare, and make it good this time.
The last one I had could've been used for a manhole cover.
This one will be so tender, it'll throw its arms around you.
- Same for you? - Yeah.
I'll just have some coffee.
- Bring her a steak.
- Fattening her up, huh?
- Something else for you, honey?
- Yes. Cool off your imagination.
Hey, McNamara.
Where are you going?
- What's it to you? - Come on.
We go. What's the matter? Don't you know me?
- Come on. Sit down, Harry.
- What are you guys doing here? - What do you suppose we're doing?
- Have a cup of coffee?
- I had five.
Don't do any good. I'm still sleepy.
- Come on. We go. - Yeah, he's right.
I haven't seen my wife for so long.
As soon as I deliver this load, I'm hot-tailing it home empty.
Bet when I walk in the kids will say, "Who's that man?"
You should have wrote, Harry. I know how worried Pearl gets.
No use writing now.
I'll be home tomorrow night and surprise her.
I hear you've been doing pretty good.
Yeah. I got the truck all paid for.
Don't owe a cent.
Come on. Let's go.
When you guys are hitting the road tomorrow think of me in that nice white bed.
Well, you gotta have your brains knocked out to be a truck driver.
You don't have to, but it helps.
Here she goes, boys, the last game. Then I can hit the road.
I don't know why I mess with them machines. They almost cost me my job three times.
Irish, you remember Cassie. Sure.
Hi, Cassie. Quit working for Barney? Yeah.
He was always trying to tie my apron strings.
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- There is if you're not wearing an apron.
Fifty-eight free games!
I'll never get away from here.
- What's that for?
- Gonna pass.
If it's clear ahead, he'll wink back at me.
That's funny. It looks clear to me. Hey, Paul.
Ain't that McNamara's truck ahead of us?
What do I care whose truck it is?
Yeah, it looks like it.
It is.
What's the matter with him? He's all over the road.
- He must be asleep.
- Blow your horn.
Not unless I have to. He might come to and run his rig off the road.
- We gotta try to head him off.
- Watch out he don't cut into us.
Get over close. I'll try to hit his hood with this and wake him up.
Pull over closer and I'll try to hop aboard!
Grab the extinguisher!
- How many in there?
- There were two.
Oh, Paul, you're late.
How's about coming in for some coffee, Joe?
Oh, this is Cassie Hartley. This is Pearl, Paul's wife. - Hello.
- Pleased to know you.
Come on, it's cold out here. Can't stop.
I'll about make the market now.
- What's wrong with Paul? - He'll be all right.
He just needs a good night's sleep.
Tell him I'll wire him from L.A. What time I'll pick him up.
I can't figure you out. If you took care of your truck like yourselves, it'd fall apart in two weeks.
We're tougher than any truck off any assembly line.
I bet your friend Harry McNamara thought that too.
Forget about Harry, will you? He probably was so tired, he thought the whole thing was a dream.
How much money you got?
- A dollar and 12 cents.
- Just what I thought. Not even enough to rent a room.
- I'll get by. - How?
I get rid of this load, I'll get you a room.
You needn't do that.
I'm grateful for the ride.
You've been nice.
If I let you go, I'll be worrying, wondering what happened to you.
And I got enough worries the way it is.
I guess I'd be pretty dumb not to say yes. Maybe I'm dumb anyway.
You can figure that out later.
I ain't used to taking in roomers at 4:30 in the morning.
It's never too late to start. The best people check in at 4:30.
I don't know about that.
I never see any of them.
Well, anyway, you got a bed for a week. Yeah.
That'll give me time to find something to do.
- I'll pay you back.
- I'm real worried about that.
I got it all doped out with the cops if you don't.
What are you crying for?
I don't know.
Just crying.
If you got a load of your face, you'd stop.
You look like you walked through a sprinkling system.
Oh, you dames are sure screwy. Paul's wife pulls the same stuff too.
One minute she's all right, the next minute, she's bawling. She never knows why.
The trouble with her is, she wants a kid. Paul says no-go.
They can't afford it.
Don't get me wrong. That's not why I'm crying.
I get a kick out of you.
I've picked up lots of girls on the road, but none of them ever was like you.
Come here.
Come on, I ain't gonna bite you.
I wasn't afraid of that.
I always have liked redheads.
You shouldn't. Red means stop.
I'm colorblind.
I think I'd better unpack.
Joe, don't you think you'd better get on your horse?
What's the rush? We got a lot of things to talk about.
We can talk some other time.
Now is a nice time.
When I'm relaxed my thoughts are clear.
Yes, I can even read them from here.
You know something, Red? I like you.
I like the way you fill out your clothes.
I like everything about you.
Are you glad you ran onto me?
Yes. You're a nice guy.
But you've got to remember that nice guys leave when ladies ask them to.
That nice, I ain't.
Mister, you worry me.
You're plenty beautiful.
Joe, you need sleep and so do I.
Will you do me a favor and get going?
I'm sorry I woke you up, I was trying to shut out the kid noise.
That's all right.
I gotta get going.
You sure slept.
That's the first time I've been in a bed in weeks.
- Where did you sleep?
- Chair.
Oh, I'm sorry, kid. I didn't mean to gyp you out of your bed.
You didn't mean anything. You went out like you were slugged.
You ought to get yourself a regular job.
What do you see in the trucking business?
I'm on my own, anyway.
If a guy can get two or three big rigs, there's a fortune in this business.
You really believe that, don't you?
Sure, I believe it. If I didn't, I'd be on Paul's side.
I'd quit right now, let Farnsworth take the truck and go grab a job digging ditches.
After what I saw last night, digging ditches looks good to me.
No future in it.
A shave wouldn't go bad, but I ain't got time now. I gotta get to market and hustle up a load.
- When will you be back? - That depends.
Maybe a couple of days. - Good.
I'll have a job by then.
- That's the talking.
In the meantime, you gotta eat.
This won't take you into the Cocoanut Grove but you'll get enough till I get back.
You must be out of your mind. You may never see me again.
Don't worry about that.
- Don't go to sleep on the road. - I won't.
Not after a pepper-up like that.
And don't practice that on anyone else.
Save it for me.
Oh, I been eating.
Where you going?
Gonna pick up some watermelons.
- Who gave you the load?
A guy would get blisters waiting for a load so I'm going down to Imperial and buy some of them babies myself.
When market opens, I'll clean up.
You know, they ain't hardly got a watermelon in town.
That's one way to do it.
Well, good luck, guy. Thanks.
Same to you.
What do you think you're doing with that broken-down tub?
Parking it. Why?
Get it out of there, or I'll park one on your chin. I was here first.
Don't look that way to me.
Smack him on the chin, boy. Shoot for his button.
What's going on?
Well, it ain't the guy selling bananas, it's a fight!
Look! Get in there, now!
Go ahead, go ahead!
Ed, stop yelling out the window. You're not a truck driver anymore.
Can I help it if I get a little excited?
When we got married, you promised to be a gentleman.
It's disgusting to see the head of a big company being noisier than his drivers.
One of those guys looks like Joe Fabrini.
It is Joe!
You remember Joe, don't you?
And Joe shouldn't be fighting in the street like that too.
You'll need the other eye for the road. And this ain't making either one of us any money.
Come on up here and see what you can do with a good man.
I used to could hit like that. And get hit too.
- Is he coming up?
Yeah, and a great guy he is too.
Say, Lana, what are you doing with all the dough?
This is 200 bucks this week.
Would you like me to give you an itemized account?
Penny by penny? Oh, no, sug.
You use all of it you want.
If you're gonna look like a million, you got to spend a million, huh?
I just got my makeup on.
You need to get romantic around noontime?
Where you're concerned, I don't watch the clock.
I wish you would.
You're having a visitor, you may as well put your coat on.
If you can't sound like an executive, you might try looking like one.
You're gonna make a gentleman out of me yet.
I doubt it.
What is it? What is it? Yes?
What...? Oh, I wish they'd stop inventing things.
Joe Fabrini to see you. What?
Oh, well, shoot him right in.
What do you know? Who do you think you are, Jack Dempsey?
What is that, a gag?
It's Lana. She thinks it makes me look dignified.
- What was the beef out there? - Oh, nothing much.
- Hello, Mrs. Carlsen.
Where have you been hiding? It's a wonder you wouldn't come see a guy.
- I've been pretty busy.
- The mice must have got into this.
That was no mice, that was a rat.
Very funny. Very funny, babe!
That's just like Lana. Right on the trigger every time.
Well, you and I will strike a blow for liberty.
- You know I never touch it. - That's all right.
I'll strike the blow for both of us.
Your liver must look like a bomb hit it.
Well, you know what I say, live and let liver.
Or, or, liver, stay away from my door.
It's a cinch to think of fast ones when you've been married to a smart girl for seven years.
Say, Joe why don't you cut out trying to beat this wildcat game and work for me?
- You beat it, didn't you? - Well, yes.
You're leading with your chin.
Working for me or any other real trucking outfit, you can only drive 8 hours at a clip and you're sure of both your sleep and your pay.
- You know what I'm gonna do, Ed? - No. Paul and me are starting to buy our own loads.
After this, we're gonna make the profits instead of 16 other guys.
I'm just getting five brand-new diesels.
I'd sure like to see you and Paul on one of them.
Thanks, Ed, but I'd still like to be my own boss.
You should listen to Ed. He's talking sense for once.
Oh, don't get me wrong, Mrs. Carlsen I probably sound like I don't appreciate Ed's offer.
I do.
But I'd still like to try it my way.
Just a few breaks, and maybe I'll be higher than Ed.
Yeah, and Ed'll be hauling for you. What do you think of that?
- Know where you can buy any loads?
- No, I ain't looked into it yet.
I know just the guy. He knows all the angles.
And since I'm gonna be working for you someday, I might as well start getting on your good side.
And you better be nice to him too.
- I'm always nice to your friends.
She kills me! I'll be right back.
- Where were you last Thursday?
- On the road, I guess. You're lying.
You were here in town.
One of the boys saw you.
So I was in town.
I waited so long in front of that restaurant, they thought I was a picket.
Don't you ever keep a date?
I didn't make a date. You did.
I told you then I wouldn't be there. And I'm telling you now... - ...
I'll never be there. - What's the matter with me?
Nothing except you got a husband, Mrs. Carlsen.
And it happens that he's a good friend of mine. Understand?
Oh, you've been listening to some narrow-minded people.
There. What would they say about that?
You know what's gonna happen to you?
One of these days, Ed is gonna catch you. And when he does, he's gonna slap your ears off.
I wonder what I see in you, anyway.
You're crude. You're uneducated.
You've never had a pair of pants with a crease in them.
And yet, I couldn't say no to you.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not asking you.
That's the United Warehouse in Pomona. Ask for Oscar Drake.
He's got a load of lemons he's dying to get rid of.
There's a flu epidemic up north and they're hot for lemons.
The guy's had the fruit laying around for some time, so you got him over a barrel.
- Got any money?
- Enough for a load.
- Thanks, Ed.
I won't forget this.
- I know.
Goodbye.
It was nice seeing you again, Joe.
Don't forget, keep your eye on that white line.
You betcha. And I'll watch all the curves too.
Now, there's a great fellow.
There's anybody in the world could beat that wildcat racket, it's him.
- Funny how the dames fell for him.
- Can't understand it.
Neither can I. Course, I mean waitresses and such.
None of them were high-class broads...
I mean, gals, like yourself.
Oh, please, Ed. Suppose someone should come in?
Then we'd have to get married all over again, wouldn't we?
- Who was it?
- It was a wire from Joe.
He'll be by for you in about a half an hour.
I think you'd better let Joe go on again.
You didn't sleep.
Well, how could I?
Every time I closed my eyes, I could see those two guys burning.
Well, I'm thankful it wasn't you.
Every minute, I expect someone to knock on the door and tell me I'm a widow.
- Please stay tonight and get some sleep.
- I can't.
I was enough of a heel last night, walking out on Joe the way I did.
I guess I'd try anything to keep you home one more day.
I'm alone so much, it's got me talking to myself. Paul.
Why can't I have a baby? Maybe then I wouldn't be so... so lonely.
There you go, singing the same old song.
- You know we can't afford a kid.
- It's the same old song from you.
How long do you think I'm gonna stay young enough?
The girls I went to school with have two or three kids now.
The girls you went to school with were smart to marry guys with real jobs.
Paul, I'm not blaming you. I'm complaining for both of us. We've got a right to a better life than this.
You could get a job and though there wasn't much money, you'd get it every week, be home nights.
- Yeah, try and tell that to Joe.
- Who are you married to, Joe or me?
I can't leave him out on a limb as long as he thinks we got a chance in this.
And there he is now.
He must have burned the rubber off that rig.
Well, I'll see you in a couple of days. - Paul, be careful.
- Don't worry, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Listen, we'll have so many kids, we'll run out of names.
- Your truck around? Yeah.
I got it parked under the kitchen sink.
There's no use getting smart.
I'm acting within my legal rights.
You're three installments behind.
Either you pay or I take the truck!
- You and who else?
- Me.
And don't try to get tough about it, buddy.
Where's the truck?
- I don't know. - It'll be along.
- He and his brother ride together.
- I ain't riding with him anymore.
He may not be by here for a couple of weeks.
That's all right. We'll wait.
If you get thirsty, come on in and I'll give you a mickey.
I'm going out the back and head Joe off at the highway.
If you didn't do anything, we'd be out of the business. You'd get that job with regular pay, and be home nights.
- It's what we both want.
- Yeah, that's what I want, all right.
But I don't want to get it by double-crossing Joe.
If I can save the rig, I gotta save it.
Keep rolling!
Farnsworth's at the house with the law.
Well, he ain't got us this time.
What's the difference? He'll get us the next.
- What are we hauling? - Lemons.
- Who for?
- Ourselves.
What do you mean?
I bought the load with the money we got from Williams.
- All of it? - All of it.
Except 2 bucks for rolling dough.
- I bought the stuff for 80 cents a box.
- Are you nuts? Relax, will you?
When we sell the load, we'll have twice what we started with.
You mean, if we sell the load.
Hey, don't I rate in this outfit? What am I, just a stooge?
Half of that dough was mine. Mine and Pearl's.
Don't I even get asked about anything?
A guy's gotta be around before you ask him.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I shouldn't have walked out on you, Joe.
That's all right.
I almost threw in the towel myself.
Well, did you see any of your old girlfriends in L. A? Nope.
Didn't have time.
Joe Fabrini didn't have time to see even one dame?
You heard me.
It's just like I've been saying. This business is really tearing us down.
- Hiya, boys. What do you got? - A load of lemons.
Wanna see them?
I really don't want no lemons, but I guess it won't hurt if I take a look.
You can have a look.
- How's the market?
- Oh, only fair.
Drop it right down there.
- Hear you got married.
- Oh, forget that.
- This ain't no lemon, this is a lemonette.
Don't try to kid us. - We know good stuff when we see it.
- I hate lemons, even if they're good.
Quit stalling, George. How do you like them?
It all depends upon what you're asking, boys.
- Well, we'll leave that up to you.
- Since you come to see me first... - ... I'll give you $3.50 a box.
- Oh, no. No deal.
Come on, give me a hand, Paul.
Wait a minute, boys.
I'll treat you right, you know that.
Name your own price.
Well, we hauled this stuff a long way and we paid a good price for them.
- We figure they're worth 5 bucks a box.
- You got me mixed up with Santa Claus.
No hard feelings.
Come on, Paul.
We'll take them down to Riley's.
We might even get 6 from him.
I'll give you $4 a box, but I want you to throw in some fill-ins.
We bought 145 boxes, and that's what we're selling.
Okay, robber.
145 boxes at $4 a box is 580 simoleons. That's all you'll get.
I don't know, George, I...
All right, it's a deal.
Dump that load.
- I'll get you your money.
Here, you always liked apples.
I hope I never have another 5 minutes like that again.
We made 500 profit on the deal. We should have a lot of 5 minutes like that.
- Well, we're finally rolling.
- It looks that way.
What next? We'll buy another load.
Then we'll buy some more loads. Then we'll buy another truck. Then buy some more trucks.
Whoa, wait a minute. Maybe we better pay for this one first. Don't worry.
We'll send Farnsworth dough tomorrow.
If you guys got any more good loads, don't forget I treated you right.
We'll come straight to you.
Come on, I wanna use the phone.
- Give me a flock of change, Leo. - Say, who you calling?
- Cassie.
That gal we picked up on the road.
I just wanna find out how she's doing.
I thought nothing happened with that dame.
Nothing did. But I ain't saying nothing won't.
Give me long distance.
Hello, Joe?
Did something happen to you? You weren't in a...?
No, nothing happened. Nothing bad, anyway.
I was scared when she told me San Francisco was calling.
- I knew it was you or about you.
- How did you know? Oh, I just knew.
Is everything all right?
Everything's great.
We got more dough than we ever seen before.
Say this is a funny time to call up a girl, ain't it? Oh, I don't mind.
I'm glad you called.
I was worried about you.
Oh, Cassie do you believe in love at first sight?
Well, it saves a lot of time.
- When are you coming back?
- I think I wanna get back and see you as fast as we can buy another load.
- Be careful and don't drive too fast.
I want to see you quick, but all in one piece.
Your three minutes are up. Deposit 50 cents for an additional minute.
Don't spend any more.
When you get back we can talk all you want, and it won't cost a...
Give me a cup of coffee, Leo.
That was great talk. Pearl and me used to have them same conversations before we got married.
Who said anything about getting married?
Nobody, but you can't horse me. I know that rash when I see it.
It all depends on how smart the dame is.
Oh, your brakes are dragging. I...
Our rig's moving!
- Hey, where do you think you're going? - Out of the truck!
Now, fellas, I'm strictly within my legal rights.
You'd look pretty silly with a monkey wrench out of your head.
- I'll call a policeman!
- If I touch you, you'll call an ambulance.
- How much do we owe you? - $300 plus $50 interest.
- Sure you ain't gypping yourself?
- Where's that loan paper? - Right here.
- Mark on it "paid in full" in big letters because that's what you're getting, cash.
You understand, there's nothing personal.
Yeah, we understand. We love you too.
Now get out of here.
- You don't have to be nasty about it.
- We don't have to be, but it's more fun.
What do you say we throw this monkey over the truck?
Well, baby, you're all ours.
- I never thought I'd live to see this day.
- And you're gonna live to see better. Come on. We just got enough dough left to buy another load.
Got that dough you owe me? - Yeah.
I'm gonna pay you in full.
- I congratulate myself.
- What are you hauling? - Pears.
Oh, fill it up with gas.
Well, I see Paul's asleep again, as usual.
What is it about my brother sleeping that annoys you so much?
You've always got your nose in everybody else's business.
If it was me I'd get a little sleep once in a while myself and let him do some driving.
Yeah, what, what's the matter?
Nothing, but you'd better take the wheel for a while.
I'm knocked out.
Where are we, Haig's?
What do you say you and I stop over and grab a couple hours of shuteye?
For the first time in our lives, we get ahead of this racket and he wants to stop and sleep.
- Sure, I wanna sleep. Everyone sleeps once in a while, remember?
You'd think I wanted to do something peculiar.
- You all right? - Yeah.
I'm all right.
But my brother's in the truck!
Shoot your lights down there.
- I'll go and get help.
Joe, how is he?
Busted up, but he's gonna be okay.
At first they thought his skull was fractured, but it ain't.
- Where is he? - Down here.
It was all my fault. He wanted to stop and sleep and I made him drive.
- Don't blame yourself, Joe.
It was bound to happen.
I'm grateful he's alive.
- The truck's gone, I suppose. - Complete wreck.
Load smashed, not a cent of insurance.
And we were just starting to do good.
It's always that way, isn't it? You and Paul will get another truck and be back on the road.
Before you go in.
Looks like Paul's gonna be out of work for some time.
And I don't want you to worry, see.
While he's getting well, I'll take care of everything.
What are you trying to do, Joe, soften the blow? - How bad is he?
- Oh, he's all right. A couple of cuts here and there.
All except his right arm.
They thought...
Well, they had to do it.
I'm gonna surprise you. I'm gonna surprise you a lot. I'm almost glad it happened!
- You heard me, I'm almost glad.
Now he can't drive a truck anymore. Now he'll be home nights.
Now I won't always be alone, worrying.
Maybe it's worth a right arm, Joe. Maybe it's worth it.
- Don't you ever knock? Oh, it's all right.
We're married. Don't you remember?
Yeah, how can I forget?
Well, what are you gonna do, open up a shop?
Where's the pole that goes with this?
Oh, to show you how things break in this business you know what happened?
Last night, the Fabrini brothers smacked up, truck and all.
- Was Joe hurt? - No.
He got scratched up a little. His brother lost a wing.
- What are they gonna do?
- Joe's gonna wheel a truck for me.
He's a good man and I hate to get him that way.
If he's a good man, why are you wasting him on the road?
Where else am I gonna put him?
Anyone with a big back can drive a truck.
Why don't you put him in the garage? In the garage?
What would he do there? I don't know.
There must be a lot of things.
You're always complaining how tired you are. Maybe if you had someone to help you you wouldn't always fall asleep after dinner.
You know, sug, that ain't a bad idea of yours.
- Always thinking of the old man, huh? - Sure I am, Ed.
But you never give me any credit for it.
- Okay, Sweeney, let her roll.
- I don't know, Mrs. Carlsen.
- I'll go and see.
- Never mind. He'll be down.
Got a match?
No lighter in this car?
It doesn't work.
Did Ed tell you about our anniversary party tomorrow night?
- I'm sorry, I can't make it.
- But Ed's counting on having you!
- Weren't you, Ed? - Sure.
- What is it, and how much does it cost?
- Joe says he can't make our party.
It's our new house. I want you to see it.
I gave it to Lana as a surprise, after she picked it out.
I had something planned with Paul tomorrow.
Look here, I'm boss. This is a royal command.
You show up at my new dump tomorrow night.
Paul don't pay your salary, I do.
Okay, I'll show up, but I've gotta leave early.
I knew Ed could bring you around. He must have more appeal than I have.
She's terrific. If you open your mouth, she puts her foot in it.
Here comes work. Good night, Mrs. Carlsen.
Right on the nose, Irish.
They must've taken out the pinball machines.
They're getting tougher. They got a new one, if you hit a winner it mixes you a drink, tucks you into bed, but nobody ever wins.
- Hi, Irish!
She almost never used to call for Ed nights until you started here. - Or am I talking out of turn?
- Come on, get washed up.
- We're going to Paul's for dinner. - Again?
It's sure nice since he moved into town. - Yeah.
Pearl's cooking a steak. - Swell!
Ain't had a steak since breakfast.
Oh, boy, I'm hungry!
- I wonder what they'll have for dessert.
- For you, probably stewed pinballs.
- That's nice. - How'd you get here so early?
I got a lift from one of the girls.
- How are you, Irish?
- Hungry. - Hiya, fellas.
Hello, Paul. Any luck today? Yeah, but all bad.
All the old men get the watchman's jobs and that's about the only thing a one-armed guy can do.
There are a lot of jobs you can handle.
Hey, Pearl, medium-rare on my steak and not much butter on my potatoes.
Any special design you want on the plate?
- Come on, everybody, sit down.
- You don't have to call me twice.
When I was riding that truck, I used to think I'd never get enough staying home. - I got enough, all right.
- Relax, you'll find something to do. Sure.
I can always learn to knit, and Ripley'll print my picture.
Have some steak, Cassie, and pass it on.
- How's things going at the store?
- Fine, except I get tired of being on my feet all day.
- I got the same trouble. The only difference is, I drive all day.
- Beer, Irish?
I'm the best two-fisted beer drinker in America.
He didn't mean no harm. He's right.
Three hands are better than two, ain't they?
- Just like two hands are better than one.
- Take it easy, fella.
Easy? Yeah, that's a nice word.
Maybe you think it's easy being helpless waiting for Pearl to dress me and feed me sitting around all day, wondering what a guy with no right arm is good for.
Why'd you ever cut me out of that wreck?
This way, she don't even get no life insurance.
- It don't help to get excited.
- It's all well for you, you're in one piece.
You don't have to take nobody's charity like I gotta take yours.
I guess he's been moping around the house too much.
After we eat, we'll go out and have some nightlife.
Maybe that'll cheer him up a little, huh?
- I ain't danced in a long time. - Me neither, and I used to love it.
It's the most fun you can have without laughing.
Take a lot to get me laughing.
Say, what do you say we get married?
I'd like that fine, but you've got enough responsibilities right now with the hospital bills and Paul out of work.
Yeah, I wish I could find him something.
Why don't you change your mind and ask Ed?
I'd like to, but I can't.
Paul ain't able to do a hard day's work at the garage yet. Ed's been too swell as it is.
- Guess we gotta just keep on hoping.
- Joe, do me a favor, will you? Take me dancing again tomorrow night when we both feel better.
Oh, I can't. I gotta go to the boss's house to a party.
Don't say "oh" like you think I'm walking out on you. - I don't wanna go.
- I didn't say you did.
Let's sit down.
If we stay here, we'll be fighting.
I'm sorry, kid. I guess I got the jitters tonight.
- Where's Irish?
- He's wandering around all over. Yeah, he's doing a little hunting.
Looks like he bagged something special.
Hello, folks. This is...
- Say, what's your name?
- Sue Carter.
- Any friend of his is a friend of mine.
- What's your name? - What's the difference?
Sit down and have a drink.
Drinking makes you beautiful.
- I haven't been drinking. - I know, but I have.
Leave it to Irish to find romance.
Don't she look like a million bucks?
And just as hard to get.
- Wanna come up for a while?
- I don't think so, not tonight.
- I'll make you some coffee. - I don't want any.
It keeps me awake.
Still worried about Paul? Yeah.
Are you too worried to kiss me?
Not that bad.
- What's the matter, you stop loving me?
- No, darling, but I still have to breathe.
Cassie, you're the only girl in this world I've ever been crazy about.
You're the only fella in the world who could make me believe a lie like that. Come on.
Come up and have some coffee.
No, no coffee.
That's what I always tell my drivers.
No phone pole ever hit a truck unless it was in self-defense.
I think the guy that wired this must have baled hay.
There.
Now, get a load... Wait a minute, now.
We have servants to open the wine.
What's the fun of having champagne if you can't pop the cork yourself?
Here now, Irish, that ain't beer, so don't start guzzling it.
And you and your truck driver friends stop drinking so much.
This is the only eighth anniversary we're ever gonna have.
Come on, we gotta celebrate.
- Evening, Mrs. Carlsen.
- You're late.
- Oh, I got stuck at the office.
- I'm sorry I forgot to tell you we were dressing.
- Well, I'm not up in that bracket yet. - Hello, Joe!
- A glass of champagne? - No, thanks.
- You know Joe never takes a drink. - I know.
He's like me.
I don't either, unless I got a glass in each hand.
Don't have any bad habits, do you, Joe?
None that I can't handle, Mrs. Carlsen.
Joe, how do you like the dump? - I think it's swell.
- You wanna know something?
Lana decorated it all by her itty-bitty self.
Early American bargain-basement.
You ain't saw it.
You ain't seen it too, Irish.
- Come on, I'Il...
Don't you think Joe ought to meet guests? What's the use?
He'll only forget their names.
- Culpepper, I sure thirsty.
- Yes, sir.
Charles, bring Mr. Carlsen some water, will you? Yes, ma'am.
I said thirsty, didn't I? Not dirty.
If you fall on your face, don't expect me to drag you to bed. Don't worry about me.
If I fall, I'll fall upstairs.
See, Joe, we had all the screens removed because they were fixed so the flies can't get out at all.
- Hey, this leaves me speechless. - Good.
Stay that way.
Well, there you are.
Swimming puddle and everything.
Hot, cold running water.
Guess I'll have to learn how to swim. - Well, right this way.
- You sure got a nice layout here, Ed.
Someday you'll have one just like it, and a swell wife like Lana to go with it.
- Yeah, that would be nice. - Yes, sir...
A couple of guys chase a feather with fly swatters and the one that don't drop dead wins the game!
And, Joe, there's something else I sure want you to get a gander at. Around a place like this, there's always a lot of confusion about bushes and trees.
Avocados, male and female.
- How can you tell? - Oh, that's easy.
The bashful one's the girl.
And now for the topper.
You know how you drive up, and you've got to get out and open the doors?
That ain't for me.
Get a load of this.
- Say, I'm speechless.
- That's where we came in.
Now you see, all you've got to do is drive or walk between the posts break the ray, and the doors start swinging.
Want to see me close them?
Say, what will they think of inventing next?
I understand some guy's working on a sundial.
Oh, Irish, don't talk silly. Who'd want to dial the sun?
- Good night, Ed. I had a swell time.
- You're going so soon?
I've got to be at the office at 6:30. Good night, everybody. - Good night.
- Joe, you're not going.
- Yes, I told you I had to leave early.
Well, I'll walk out with you.
I need some air.
Don't you think you'd better go in?
No, it feels good.
- I had a nice time, Mrs. Carlsen. - Do you have to call me Mrs. Carlsen?
You know, I have a first name.
When I call you Mrs. Carlsen, that keeps me in my place.
Wouldn't be trying to get over it also keeps me in my place? - That ain't what I said.
- I can read between the lines.
- Joe, what is it? What's wrong? - Nothing wrong that I know of.
Then why do you keep acting like this?
Why do you keep pretending you don't even notice me?
Now look, who do you think you're fooling?
I'm not fooling anybody, and that includes you and me both.
If I told you once, I told you 50 times, I'm doing good at the office and I'm not playing around with the boss's wife.
Ed's been always all right with me, and I'm never gonna be wrong with him.
How touching. The faithful employee.
The devoted friend.
That's me.
Good night, Mrs. Carlsen.
I'm gonna drink you all a little toast.
Early to rise and early to bed makes a man healthy, but socially dead.
Now I'm gonna take you all to the Tango Club. Tango Club!
Oh, sugar, listen, will you rush out and leap into that ermine gunnysack? - We're gonna sneak up on a rumba.
- What's the matter, not enough liquor?
Maybe you'd like to put a still in the basement.
Never at a loss for a comeback.
We're married eight years, and she still tickles me pink.
You don't want to dance? She don't care to dance.
I always get a partner.
- No, that's one thing I'm not gonna do.
The liquor is no good.
You can't get drunk on it.
Then someone must have hit you over the head with a mallet.
Someone help me get him out of here. I'll drive him home.
- You're lucky I stayed sober. - It certainly does.
- I don't want to dance now. - Very well. - Come on, Ed.
Oh, it's a shame, a fine fellow like the boss disgracing himself in public. Yeah.
Sit up, you drunken pig.
Let's go in the office and take a little snooze.
Come on, get up and walk, or do I have to carry you?
No, I'm just gonna catch a little snooze.
Needless to say, Mrs. Carlsen, I regret having to go through this formality.
He was so drunk.
I always told him something awful would happen if he kept drinking that way.
Naturally, I couldn't lift such a heavy man out of the car.
He'd stayed in the garage before but he always came in the house when he sobered up.
- Don't distress yourself, Mrs. Carlsen. Just take your time.
This time, he must have awakened still drunk and started the car.
Oh, it's awful.
He wanted so much to live.
- He had everything to live for.
- Thank you, Mrs. Carlsen. I regret that I've been forced to question you.
I won't bother you further. - You're very kind.
- Please accept my sincerest sympathy.
The cause of death was accidental, carbon monoxide poisoning.
Close the case.
- Stop creeping around the house. - I wasn't creeping.
Honest, I wasn't.
- I don't want you snooping around. - I wasn't doing no snooping.
I come in to see if you wanted coffee.
I've had four cups. I don't want any more, you hear?
- Well, do you hear?
! - Yes.
Now get out of my sight, and stop sneaking around!
I don't want you spying on me!
You were supposed to be here at 10:00.
One of our drivers crashed into a load of pipe...
- I don't care about that.
- The driver don't, either.
He's dead.
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.
Being alone in this big house gives me the willies.
- Would you like a drink? - No, thanks.
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
Sit down, Joe.
What was this business you wanted to talk to me about?
Look, Joe, I don't know anything about the company.
I've tried to understand, and the lawyers have explained things to me. The more they talk, the less I know.
I can't run a trucking business by myself. I've got to have someone to help me.
- Does that mean me? - Yes.
Ed had such confidence in you.
He said you had great ideas. I know he'd want you to be my partner. - Partner?
- Yes, partner. 50-50.
I've got the papers all drawn up, and all you have to do is...
Don't you want to own half of the big trucking business?
With anyone else, I'd think it was a swell deal, but you...
It's good for me because if I don't get help, I'll lose the business.
It's good for you because you'll never get this chance again.
- No interference? - None.
I promise you, Joe.
I don't know anything about trucks. How could I interfere?
- I wasn't talking about trucks.
- Oh, you've got to help me, Joe.
Well, what's it gonna be?
If it's gonna be like you say, you can count me in. Oh, I'm so glad, Joe.
Neither of us will regret it.
Now, how about that drink to celebrate, just this once?
- It's gonna work out fine, Joe. I know it will.
And it's what Ed would have wanted.
Maybe you're right.
Well here's to our partnership. May it be a long and happy one.
It could work out pretty good.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll figure out new lines, buy new trucks.
We'll get business we never even thought about. We'll go a long way.
Yes, we will.
- Hey, Joe, who sneaked those rigs in? - New refrigerator jobs.
Opens up a lot of dairy business for us.
I don't know where I'm gonna get 20 drivers to wheel them.
- Is Bill McGowan a good driver?
- I don't want to say anything bad but when the road turns the same time he does, it's just a coincidence.
Yeah, that's what I thought. - What's the trouble?
- Got to clean and adjust the points.
- How long will it take? - About 15 minutes.
- These the new trucks? - Yeah.
I see you got a new buggy. - Blowing all the profits?
- We're making a lot of profits to blow.
Why not?
Say, that's a snappy outfit.
You like it?
I didn't think you'd notice.
It isn't too soon for me to stop wearing black, is it? - No, I don't think so.
- That's the way I felt.
Take a good look.
You're not gonna see me in the same outfit twice for months.
Come on, I want you to meet Mrs. Carlsen.
- If you're talking business, I'll wait. - Oh, no.
- Cassie and I were going to get dinner.
- Would you care to come along?
What's the matter?
Get some water.
- We'll take her to a doctor. - Take me home.
- Don't you think it...?
- I said, take me home!
- I'll run it in the garage for you. - No, stop.
Stop it, do you hear?
- What's the matter with you?
- Please, let me out. Please, let me out!
- Would you like me to come in?
- Leave me alone.
Here are those federal gas papers. They look all right. Fine, George.
I'll go over them.
Mrs. Carlsen's been here while you were out to dinner.
I don't know, she may be here yet.
We may knock over that federal gas contract. That's swell.
- How do you feel tonight?
- Oh, much better. Oh, that's good.
Sorry about yesterday, Joe.
I guess my nerves just gave out.
You ought to go away for a while, get a change.
You've been hanging around that house too much.
Your friend Miss Hartley, she's very nice.
- Known her long? - Quite a while.
Did you have a nice time after you left me? It was all right.
You must apologize to Miss Hartley for me.
Oh, she didn't think anything of it.
- How about some dinner, Joe? - I've had mine.
You could sit with me and have a drink.
Maybe we could dance.
I'd like to, but I've got to get some estimates. Figures on the new trucks.
I know, but you can do all that tomorrow morning.
I've got a lot of other things to do in the morning, and this is important.
It's the only time I have to do it.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I guess I'm a fine partner, trying to pull you away from your work.
The Frank Conners are throwing a party Friday night.
They asked me to bring you along.
Sorry, I can't make it. "Can't make it.
That's all I ever hear from you.
It used to be because my husband was your friend.
Well, he's dead.
He's been dead for six months.
What's wrong with me now?
Why can't you make it?
I'm getting married Friday. Is that a good enough reason?
To that redhead?
To that redhead.
What made you think you had to marry her?
I just thought it was a good idea.
Any objections? Yeah, I got objections.
What makes you think you can make a sucker out of me?
- You better relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, you road slob. If it weren't for me, you'd still be kicking trucks up the coast.
I get Ed to take you off the road.
I put that clean collar around your dirty neck.
I put those creases in your pants. I put that money in your pocket.
What makes you think you can walk out on me?
I came in here on a business deal, and I've done all right for you.
Don't talk like a fool.
I walked you right into a company that was set and established.
I gave you Ed's insurance money to buy new trucks.
I could have picked anyone off the street and they'd have done as well.
Anytime you don't like the setup, I can check out. You're not getting out.
You belong with me, and you're gonna stay.
If you don't like it, you'll learn to.
Only you're not going off marrying that cheap redhead.
I'm marrying cassie, and I'm not asking anybody what they think.
That includes you.
She hasn't any right to you. You're mine, and I'm hanging on to you.
I committed murder to get you.
Understand?
Murder.
- Sure. I killed Ed.
I killed him to get you because you always threw him in my face.
"Yes, Mrs. Carlsen. No, Mrs. Carlsen. No, Mrs. Carlsen.
Good night, Mrs. Carlsen". You made me do it. You, understand?
I didn't want to kill anyone, but you made me murder Ed, your friend.
Joe, where are you going?
I'm getting out of here, and stay away from me.
Oh, Joe, don't go.
Forget what I said.
I didn't mean what I said.
I didn't know what I was talking about. - I didn't kill Ed.
It was just an accident.
- Save that record for someone else.
- You may need it. - Oh, listen, Joe.
I'll be a good sport.
Marry her, and I hope you're happy with her, only please don't leave me.
Please come back.
I didn't want to kill anyone. I didn't.
I didn't want to kill anyone.
He made me do it.
Yes. He made me kill him.
He made me kill him. He said he'd kill me if I didn't.
I didn't want to do it, but I was afraid of him. I had to.
Joe wanted the insurance money.
He wanted everything for himself. He made me do it.
Just a moment.
Have Joe Fabrini of Carlsen Trucking picked up, and you come in here.
In other words, when you were in this office the morning after your husband's death, your statement was a lie.
Yes, but I didn't want to lie. I was afraid to tell the truth then.
- Now I'm not afraid anymore. - I see.
The truth is that you were coerced into murdering your husband by Fabrini.
Yes, yes, that's it.
- He made me kill him.
I'm going to dictate for your signature the confession you've just made to me.
Correct me if I'm wrong. "I, Lana Carlsen..."
She never thought I'd see her.
I'll bet she was surprised when they told her I would. I'll see her, all right.
I've got things to tell her.
- All right, tell her, not me.
- What's the matter with you?
- That door it opened.
- Of course it did.
We broke the ray. It's an electric eye door. Come on.
No, I won't go through it. I won't go through it, I tell you. - I won't, I tell you.
I thought you'd show up. Now that you're here, what do you want?
I want you to tell the truth.
What do you think the truth is?
Joe had nothing to do with killing your husband, and nothing to do with you.
Is that so? What do you think he was doing those nights he was working in the garage?
Do you think he was in the garage at all?
Why do you think I took him into the business?
Why did I give him my husband's insurance money to play with?
Because he had an honest face?
You could talk from now on, but you'd never make me believe that Joe ever laid a hand on anyone like you.
- What makes you so sure of that?
- I love him. I know.
You love him.
You don't know what it is to love a man, but I do.
And I'll take him with me wherever I'm going.
You're worse than I thought anyone could be.
Why don't you tell them what really happened? Joe wouldn't have anything to do with you.
You killed your husband because you thought he was in the way.
You threw yourself at Joe, but he wouldn't look at you because he had you pegged from the beginning.
Tell them you found out he was going to marry me and you decided to stop it, even if it meant double-crossing yourself.
You've got it all worked out, haven't you?
But you've got it worked out wrong, all wrong. Because I'm the one who...
Stop that door.
Stop it, I tell you. Stop that door! - Stop it!
No, I won't go through that door! I won't! You can't make me!
- Come on, come on.
- What's the dame hitting high c for? - Maybe she don't like the service here.
I don't know why these things always got to bust at lunchtime.
This one's all right. Close her up.
So, Your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury the prosecution will prove that Joe Fabrini by means of duress and threats, employed the wife of the murdered man as ruthlessly as ever a man employed a dagger or gun, to commit for profit a cold-blooded, brutal, preconceived murder.
With your permission, I will call the first witness, Miss Sue Carter.
Is it true you attended a party at the Carlsen home the night of Mr. Carlsen's death?
Yes, Your Honor.
The judge is the only person in this courtroom to be addressed as "Your Honor".
- Now, at this party during the evening did you see Mr. Fabrini and Mrs. Carlsen in private conversation?
- Miss Carter, I am asking the questions.
Now, where did this conversation take place?
Well, I just happened to be in the powder room powdering my nose, of course, and I looked out the window and I saw Mr. Fabrini and Mrs. Carlsen standing by the side of his car arguing.
- Did you hear what they were saying? - Well, I didn't exactly hear.
You understand, I didn't try, but it seemed to me that one of them wanted the other one to do something but I couldn't tell who wanted who to do what to which.
When your brother became head of the Carlsen Trucking service did you get a job as traffic manager with the company? - Yeah, but...
The question is leading.
- Objection sustained.
- That's all.
Miss Hartley, you say that you and Mr. Fabrini have been in love, plan to be married.
- That's right.
- Can you tell me why you didn't get married some time ago?
- We couldn't afford it.
- Did Fabrini work evenings quite a bit? - Yes.
- Could you swear that Mr. Fabrini was actually in his office working on those evenings? - No, but I...
- Isn't it possible that Mr. Fabrini didn't marry because he found marriage inconvenient in his relations with Mrs. Carlsen? - Objection.
The witness will not have to answer that.
Isn't it true that Mr. Fabrini kept you two ladies apart until one evening, when he got his dates crossed he found you both face to face? - Well, Joe never did...
- I object!
- Overruled.
- Isn't it true that Mrs. Carlsen was so unnerved that she fainted?
- Certainly, she was ill.
Ill of shock.
Shocked at finding the man for whom she murdered her own husband with another woman. That's not right.
Joe didn't help in any murder.
He didn't have anything to do with it. If he thought...
That's all.
Did you say anything to Mr. Fabrini about Mrs. Carlsen?
I don't remember.
Did you ever notice that after Fabrini came to work at Carlsen's that Mrs. Carlsen frequented the garage more than she had previously?
- Don't you remember anything?
- Why don't you remember?
- Maybe it's because I got a bad memory.
Now, Your Honor and ladies and gentlemen of the jury I call to the stand Mrs. Lana Carlsen.
State your name.
- You will speak up, please.
You were, at the time of his death, the wife of Edward Carlsen? Yes.
How long before the death of Carlsen were you acquainted with Joe Fabrini? Two years.
Where did you first meet him?
Mrs. Carlsen, I asked you where you first met Fabrini.
You will answer the question, please.
He was laughing. Yes, he...
He was laughing.
He kissed me when he was drunk.
Yes, he kissed me when he was drunk.
So I got a new car.
And I bought some new clothes.
Yes, they were pretty.
And he used to tell terrible jokes.
And he'd laugh at them.
He was always laughing.
And then I saw him lying there drunk. I heard the motor running.
And I saw the doors. I heard the motor.
The doors made me do it.
Yes.
The doors made me do it.
The doors made me do it! - Matron, remove the witness.
- They made me do it!
Your Honor, I move that this case be dismissed on the ground that the sole witness to the alleged crime is obviously insane.
Court is adjourned while the state's alienist examine Mrs. Carlsen.
- City desk and hurry. - Give me the desk. Hello, Ed.
The doctors all say she's daffy.
Yeah, nuts.
They had to take her away in a straitjacket. Yeah, that's right.
Case thrown out of court. Fabrini goes free.
Sounds funny, I suppose, but I can't help feeling sorry for that dame.
Me too, in a way.
- What about the business, Joe? - What about it?
It's like I told you. I'm giving my share to the boys.
After what's happened, I need a change of scenery.
What about us?
We're getting married just like we figured. I'll dig up a new truck and hit the road again.
Why, I'll be on top in no time. I can't miss with...
Say, you're not gonna tell me I'm not right, are you? No, Joe.
Of course, I hate to see you go back to the road but if that's the way you want it I'm with you around every curve.
Well, my mind's made up.
Gee, I promised to phone the store. Do you mind stopping while I call?
This is Cassie.
- Hello, cassie.
Joe's on his way to tell you he's giving up the business.
Have the guys shout him down, I'll do the rest. Okay, kid.
My mind's made up too.
So it's like I tell you, fellas.
I don't feel I got the right to stay on here so I'm giving you my share, and I'm bowing out.
- You're on a dead-end street, Joe. That's right, Joe.
These boys want no part of an executive business.
Paul here can handle things as good as anybody. Oh, no, not me.
I got too many other problems.
- We're gonna have a baby.
- Congratulations.
Say, does Pearl know?
- Say, that's good news, Paul. - You can give us some good news.
Say you're staying on as the head guy.
Fellas, I'm sure glad you feel this way, but I...
- What do you think, Cassie? - Your mind's made up, Joe.
But there's a lot of angles here.
Somebody's got to take care of those accounts. - I may get that gas contract.
- I wouldn't try to influence you any more than I would the boys, Joe, but the way you're talking maybe you'd better stay.
Okay, fellas, I'm sticking with you.

ENGLISH
THE THIEF OF BAGDAD
I never knew why the men came back of the sea
The sea is cruel, but the sea is pure
That the immense sea is pure
Must come of the fact that the men in sea
Are few and very distant
She/it never caused to me that of the sufferings
And yet I wonder why the men come back of the sea
The sea is cruel, but the sea is pure
Oh, poor brunette earth
So much kindness you could have dispensed
Of good news of the princess?
No, master.
Dead?
Still sleepy.
Did you obey me?
Yes, master.
The blind?
One found it.
The charity, for Allah's love.
The charity, for Allah's love.
Does your illegitimate child dare to bark?
Beautiful gratitude, in truth!
Your piece is false.
Then you cheat, malandrin.
A blind cannot make the difference.
Alas, I see drop there.
It is my dog.
How a dog can he/it know?
Verify.
By Allah's prodigies!
She/it is false and I ignored it.
Approach, amateur of trunks of trees and unearth the false piece.
It is not a dog but the Large reincarnate Treasurer!
Oh you to that Allah fills the eyes of all these beauties, dedicate a thought to the one for that these marvels sank in the eternal night.
The charity, for Allah's love.
The charity, for Allah's love.
Bring it to me.
Pray for me, I am called Halima.
I don't know you.
Does one know all his/her/its friends?
I don't have some.
You will trust to the one that offers you food and rest in his/her/its house?
What is mine is yours.
In return for what?
Of your prayers.
It is little strong.
Take my hand.
My dog sees for me.
He/it gives to me more that he/it doesn't receive in return.
This sleep pass my understanding.
But when the blind will come, she/it will come out of the sleep.
Étrange that he/it can succeed where we fail.
He/it will heal it and I will hunt it.
But she/it likes the blind.
The lisp of two children is he/it the love?
She/it ignores all of the love.
I am going to teach it to him.
Poor blind.
And even poorer than it.
Impossible.
One is not veiled.
My eyes are... veiled.
What is your name?
Ahmad.
You don't have need anymore to beg.
- Nor to wander.
- Remains with us!
Sovereigns, I know you beautiful but would not know to stop before having recovered my beloved.
The seers often pass their life without finding it.
Remain.
Our physicians will heal you maybe.
Sink perspective...
You speak by enigmas.
I go to put you on the way.
He/it was a king, son of king, and of hundred kings.
His/her/its topics were numerous, his/her/its huge fortune and his/her/its power, absolute.
This dog was not a dog, but a kid of Baghdad who became dear to the king.
Then, he/it was again that a small thief.
That you to sniff have my fish, manant?
Go-t'en!
Do I call the care?
To the thief!
Stop it!
King Ahmad, son of Akbar, grandson of Haroun-Al-Raschid, the Large, the lllustre,
Lord of the Earth,
Defender of the Faith,
Servant of the Almighty and Mr. of all men.
Ahmad, the king!
Ahmad, the king...
Alas, I was this man.
I possessed 365 women but my heart ignored the love.
I had 50 palaces, without being at home.
Although rich, I was poorer than the poor people.
All desire satisfies removed me all other desire.
I didn't find anything to make in my vast kingdom.
I was without projects, without goals, because my big vizir Jaffar interfered between me and my people.
Again an execution...
For what misdemeanor?
He/it thought, my Lord and master.
Is this a crime?
It is unforgivable for a topic.
Is it necessary to govern by the fear?
The man is bad, hateful, lying and traitorous in the soul.
You will learn, big king, that the man only respect three things:
the whip that stings, the yoke that suppresses and the sword that kills.
By the terror that they trigger, you will be able to conquer the earth.
Do I want only of it?
What would you like to make?
I would like to make they happy.
Happy?
It is not that of the silly and the roguish.
Your grandfather had learned it.
Make as him, one evening, when the night falls, leave the palace, mingle yourselves to the crowd, enter at people, listen, observe, and remember of it.
Tonight, Jaffar.
Tonight, my king.
Your people, my king.
I am near to him.
Observe and remember.
He/it is said, by Allah's grace, that he/it was a king among the kings, master of the weapons, of the armies and vessels, a main oppressor of the time and the people.
The earth was a punishment for his/her/its topics.
What does he/it say?
I don't know.
Does he/it speak of the king?
Don't ask any questions.
The spies swarm.
It is necessary to be prudent in Baghdad.
I am a stranger, you can tell myself of what he/it speaks.
He/it speaks of hope, of a prophecy about a liberator.
Only the silly believe there.
A liberator...
Not so much as Ahmad will be a king.
They complained in secret and were punished on the place of the market.
But a sage among the sages announced them this prophecy:
"With time, a liberator will come.
"ll will be the humblest
"of the humble and will appear on the clouds."
"We will observe them! " tells people,
"But if the Almighty is not able to anything,
"what will he/it be able to there, him"?
The visionary answered:
"Have confidence in Allah,
"because in the sky you will see a boy
"of the humblest, overlapping a cloud.
"Cloud as strong that a rock under snow
"from where he/it will shoot the arrow
"justicière who will hit the tyrant."
The tyrant's name?
Ahmad!
I dream of a miracle.
That he/it dies today.
Stop it.
Throw it in jail.
If he/it tells himself/itself king, call it madman.
Kill anyone comes to his/her/its help.
I understood then that he/it was bad.
He/it had deceived me to trap me better.
One threw me in jail... and there, my life began indeed because I knew there the one that became my only friend,
Abu, the small thief of Baghdad.
One doesn't throw that the small in jail.
No, not the jail!
Advance, thief!
First cut him the hands, then the legs and finally the head.
I don't want to die!
Tomorrow morning.
As for the mad, our sultan is generous, only the head.
To the sunrise.
You became madman.
Me?
Would I be mad?
It is you the mad.
Are you indeed?
It is that, I am mad.
I must be he.
The maddest of the mad of the palace.
You are mad, really mad.
What imports?
Tomorrow, unless the sun don't rise, one will die.
The thief and the mad...
I don't want to die.
You are not mad and we will survive maybe at dawn.
We will have died at dawn!
To the dawn, we will take a boat and we will go toward the sea.
I never saw the sea but I heard of the sailors to speak of it.
There are fish big as the temple and of others, small as my finger, with wings.
There are some boats as big as Baghdad, to the veils big as clouds and that spin as quickly as of the antelopes until the islands of the Indies and of China.
The Indies and China...
Whereas we are in jail.
The ax will fall at dawn.
And you pretend not to be mad!
Watch!
It is the key of the jail.
Give it to me!
One is not able to to leave now.
- Why?
- Wait.
They are going to eat and after them will fall asleep.
Then one will leave.
Quickly, take this paddle!
Pass me the rope!
Do you want us to make kill?
You believe what they would have mercy?
If the king knew, would not he/it have mercy?
The king was a silly.
I hope that he/it suffers to death.
Do you hate it so much?
Everybody hated it.
So only I could hold it there, I would tell to him my way of thinking.
Tell it to me, I am king Ahmad.
Speak!
King Ahmad died yesterday.
Jaffar is the new king.
Watch!
Jaffar would never have sent the whole care for me all alone.
Mercy, master.
I am your slave.
Punish me slightly and I will pay for double tax.
How are you called?
Abu the thief, son of Abu the thief, grandson of Abu the thief.
Last of ten children with the hunger pegged to the body.
Raise you, my friend.
Let's go back to Baghdad.
Are you completely silly?
Forgiveness...
My king would make himself/itself kill.
Dead, we won't be able to anything anymore.
You seem me to be the prince of the thieves.
The breeze will push us toward the liberty.
I possessed everything, except the liberty.
And me, it is the opposite.
What are we going to make?
What you want.
In 3 days one will be in Bassora.
Take this stick and shoot!
I want to be a sailor who sails on the sea
Life on dry land let me a bitter taste
The aunts and the cousins are not very shrewd
They give desire to be marine or bandit of big path
I want to be a brigand, have it understood you
To sail on the sea it is my life
It is my life...
Abu!
Bassora!
Bassora...
That it is beautiful!
Çhave felt so good!
Of the pancakes!
Give!
You are indeed silly.
Çhas eaten himself with the honey.
How to steal it?
One already has that, Allah will provide there also.
Do you want the honey?
- One intends to buy some.
- A jar.
A jar?
!
If he/it is good.
It is the best.
Easy to say, I must first taste.
I saw better.
What do you say of it?
No, not good enough.
Çhas lack of flavor.
Take care of your bees!
Say, old man, what is this palace?
The one of the sultan, let's see!
You know well, the palace of the one thousand toys.
Toys?
Of where take yourselves, beggars of nothing at all?
The sultan has the most beautiful collection of the world.
Of the toys?
The sultan is aged and he/it falls again in childhood.
He/it stays up more jealously on his/her/its toys that on his/her/its own girl.
I told to some enough.
Out of my path, bags to fleas.
Allah is with you.
I question some.
[Skipped item nr. 320]
Release me!
The princess arrives!
- Does reason flee one?
- One risks the death.
Why?
She/it must not be seen before his/her/its marriage.
Is she/it so ugly?
She/it is beautiful as a star!
Release me!
- Spin!
- Where?
Up there!
Your appetite will cost us life.
Without eating one dies.
Abu, there they are!
I must see it again.
I spoke to Sinbad the sailor, he/it takes us on his/her/its boat.
I ever imagined some of as beautiful.
He/it leaves to the next tide.
I cannot leave.
I must see it again.
All my life I dreamed to leave on a big boat.
I cannot leave.
I must see it again.
If you see it again, after you will follow me?
I will follow you.
Oh my poor heart who palpitates so strong
Today curb your transportation
Because it is necessary for us to wait of the men this famous tender word
And when, oh my heart,
This one makes itself hear
Beat the chamade and venerate
This word that would be able to to be sincere
[Skipped item nr. 354]
He/it is sufficient.
It is as heavy that the air of noon.
Let's wait for the nightingale of in the evening.
To the swimming pool!
A genius!
Don't go there!
II has a genius there!
A genius!
Are you afraid?
Yes, frightfully.
Why don't you flee?
I want to see.
You are my first genius.
Then, observe me well.
It is not necessary to lie to a genius.
You are not ugly.
Are you a good genius?
Not indeed.
The good geniuses are overwhelming.
Do you live thereunder?
No.
- Why are you there?
- To see you.
I was going to bathe.
I wait.
Whereas you are there?
Give me your hand, in water.
You left!
I didn't want.
Will I ever see you again?
Ever?
Don't be afraid, I am not a genius.
Who are you?
Your slave.
From where do you come?
On the other side of the time, to find you.
Did you look for me since when?
The beginning of the times.
And now, will you a long time remain?
Until the end of the times.
For me, you are what of more beautiful has.
He/it is not of bigger pleasure for me that the one to satisfy you.
