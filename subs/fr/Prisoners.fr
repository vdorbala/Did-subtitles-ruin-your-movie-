Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come... thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation... but deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours... now and forever.
Amen.
Looking at mostly cloudy skies and with lows in the upper 20s... there will be some refreeze on some of the roads... so slick spots are possible tonight in isolated--
You know the most important thing your granddad ever taught me?
Be ready.
Hurricane, flood, whatever it ends up being.
No more food gets delivered to the grocery store, gas stations dry up.
People just turn on each other, and, uh.... All of a sudden, all that stands between you and being dead is you.
I'm proud of you, son.
It was a nice shot.
Hey, come on, hon.
Wait. I forgot something.
Hold on a second, Anna!
- Ralph, you have the venison? - Yup.
I forgot the pie.
Are we taking the truck?
We're going up the street, you dope.
Come on.
Hey, wait for your mother, please.
Give me a ride.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
Danny's dad said he'd sell me their old car.
I got half of what I need saved from the summer.
- I thought maybe--
- Forget it.
I can barely get enough carpentry work to keep up with the mortgage.
Why don't you rent out Grandpa's old apartment house?
Like I keep telling your mother, it's an old building.
It'll cost a fortune to fix it up.
They're here!
- Hello.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Anna, wait until we're invited.
For God's sake, Keller. Get the hell in here.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Turkey Day.
- Keller, got the deer you shot?
- This one's Ralph's.
- You killed it, you take it into the kitchen.
- Thank you.
- I loved that last meal you gave us.
- There he is.
- Thank you.
Happy T-Day.
- How are you?
- All right.
- Good to see you.
Joy, three times.
Joy, get those dolls off the table.
- Anna!
Anna! - Hi.
How are you?
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi, Eliza. - Anna, come here.
We wait until we're invited, you understand?
You're in charge of this.
Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.
No problem.
Can I go outside with Joy?
Convince your brother to go with you and you can.
And wear a hat, please.
You're just getting over a cold.
Joy, you wear a hat too.
Did you feel bad for that deer when you shot it?
Do you feel bad for cows when you go to McDonald's?
That's what my dad says.
Deer, if they have too many babies... the babies starve anyway.
You gotta keep the population down.
Right.
- Your dad say that too?
- Pull harder.
Hey! Get away from that thing!
Let me see that.
- Come on, let's go.
- No.
I said, let's go!
Stop. Stop. You can't just hit somebody's stuff like that.
- No! Let's go!
Come on, come on. - Let me--!
Wait. You hear that?
Somebody's in there.
I don't feel like getting yelled at. Let's go.
Don't climb up, okay?
The school board's telling me there's no money for new band uniforms.
Kids are wearing the same uniforms they had when we went there.
They were old then.
I mean, marching right out of 1979.
Why isn't he speaking to me?
He doesn't speak.
Cutie pie.
Oh, my gosh!
He's fast too.
He's so quick.
Is that a slide?
Thank y'all. Thank y'all. Got a surprise.
And I am taking requests.
You gotta listen out for it because this is not easy.
Mommy, can I take Joy to our house?
- Why?
- My red whistle.
She's gonna help me look for it.
Sweetheart, I think that red whistle is long gone.
What whistle?
The emergency whistle Daddy gave me. I lost it... a hundred and 33 days ago.
Well, if you want to find a whistle, you have to whistle for it.
So we'll do "Jingle Bells" to find it.
Jingle Bells, Batman smells Robin laid an egg
The Batmobile lost its wheel And Joker got away
Okay.
Okay! Okay. You can go.
Just make sure Eliza and Ralph go with you, please.
- No looking in the basement.
- I won't.
Your eardrums are starting to grow.
Don't want to damage them yet.
- But I am taking requests from you, Keller.
- From me?
- Your day, your request.
- The piano.
- No. So all set?
- No, no, no.
Wait, listen. He used to love-- He used to dress like Springsteen.
- I still love Springsteen.
- "Jersey Girl."
Well, I ain't white, and I like him too much, and I'm too drunk to cover The Boss.
- Thank you.
- Honey?
- What else?
- Nothing comes to mind. Nothing.
- Oh, I know.
- What?
He actually loves "The Star-Spangled Banner." I know.
Sings it in the shower.
- I do not. - Yes, you do!
I got you.
Where are your sisters?
I can't find them.
You.... go to the house with them?
No. What are you talking about?
- Earlier?
- No.
What? They were supposed to come down earlier and get you.
They didn't come?
No. We haven't seen them since we ate.
It's all right.
They're probably at our house.
Anna?
Joy?
Girls?
Girls?
- Who put these in here?
- Get out of here.
- They weren't outside.
It's starting to rain.
- Did you check by Maria's swing?
They're getting whupped when they get here.
Sorry, Grace. I whup kids.
What? So they weren't there either?
- They must be at home.
- Are they here?
- They weren't there?
- No, they're not at the house.
They're not there.
I checked the entire house.
They're not here.
The RV.
Dad, there was this RV and they were playing on it.
There was-- We thought there was someone inside.
- Wait, nobody--
- Where?
Where was it?
Show me.
- You wait here.
- Let me go!
- I'm gonna search the house again. - Relax.
Relax.
Go that way.
I'll meet you on the other side.
Anna?
Joy!
- Roger, you seen my daughter walk by here?
- No. Is there a problem?
Here! Dad, it was parked right here.
- Hello, hello! - Did you see them?
- I couldn't find them!
- Were you messing around in this house?
- No.
- Told you not to come here.
They were on the RV and we got them off of it.
Tell me everything you remember about that RV.
- A ladder on the back.
- Police, police.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Thanks.
Hey, you have any of those fortune cookie things?
My boss told me cops don't like fortune cookies.
What year were you born?
Are you a dragon or a snake or a horse, or--?
I'm a monkey.
Oh, you're a monkey.
You're very intelligent. You have an ability to influence people.
Think you could influence your boss to lower the check a little bit?
No. I cannot.
My boss is a rooster.
So he's selfish and eccentric, that's....
All units, all units.
An RV was reported matching the description.
The vehicle is parked at a rest stop off of Route 46, northbound, past exit 17.
Any available units?
This is 12-12 responding.
10-80 responding.
This is 13-40.
I'm five minutes out.
I'll meet the responding units.
- 12-12 standing by.
- 10-80 standing by.
13-40.
I am on-scene.
Be advised, we are moving in.
Don't move, wait!
- Watch out!
- Hey! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
All right, Sloan, take the right!
Clear!
Clear!
Hey! Wait, wait, wait. I got this.
Give me that.
Hey, I see you in there.
Show me both your hands right now.
Hey! I see you in there.
Show me your hands!
Both hands right now!
Nice and slow. Slow. Slow!
Both fucking hands!
Walk! Walk!
Walk! Get up! Get up!
Get up!
Show me those girls!
Show me where you put those girls.
Where are those girls? Where are those girls?
- Give me the flashlight.
- Sir.
Show me where those girls-- They in the woods?
You put them in the woods?
Where did you put those girls?
You hear me?
What the fuck is this guy on?
No, he's high on something.
Put this fucking guy in the car. Get him in the car.
- Put him in the fucking car! Walk!
- Let's go.
Hey, call P.S.P., tell them to send their scent dogs.
And seal off the whole area.
The entrance, all of it.
- Right. - You, come with me.
No, they weren't playing on your RV?
No.
Okay, take a look at them again.
- Don't recognize these girls?
- I didn't see them. May I sit down?
What do you do in the RV?
- Answer my questions.
- Sleep there.
You sleep in there?
You were sleeping out there?
In the day?
Why was the RV parked outside the house?
I went for a drive?
You went for a drive?
You weren't driving.
I know girls were playing outside your RV.
You weren't driving.
It was parked. Was it a special day?
- Were you planning on taking two little girls? - No.
- Have you done that before?
- No.
- Did you ask them to come inside?
- No.
You ask them to come in...
- and then you take them away?
- No.
- You put those girls somewhere?
- May I sit?
- Come on.
- Please don't touch me.
I know you put those girls somewhere.
- You hide them?
- No.
How did you hide them.
Did you tie them up?
Did you tie them up?
Look, I know you're a good guy. I know you're a decent guy.
I'm not telling you you're doing anything bad.
I'm just trying to get the right answers.
The real ones.
That's all I want.
Where do you usually park your RV, Alex?
My aunt's house.
Your aunt's house?
She lets me park it in the back yard.
Grass don't grow back there anyway.
It was my husband's.
For sale, if you want it.
No, thanks.
Would you tell me what you're doing on my property then?
I'm just glad to know where he is.
He's always home before dark, and...
I just don't understand.
That boy has never been in trouble, not a day in his life.
In the summertime, he sleeps out in the camper some, but... this time of year he sleeps in here on the sofa bed.
That's my husband.
We had a fight, jeez, five years ago.
Walked out, didn't come back.
Alex loved him like a father.
Where are Alex's real parents?
My husband's brother and his girlfriend... they died in a car accident when Alex was about 6.
Sorry to hear that.
He doesn't have much.
What have you got?
Well, this thing's clean. I mean, it's filthy as shit, but we didn't find anything.
You didn't find any wool fibers, anything like that?
The girls could be wearing some wool gloves or wool hat, no cotton fibers?
If he was using this to transport them, I might buy that.
But if there had been a struggle, I would have found something.
I'd start looking in the woods by the rest stop.
Yeah, half the uniformed cops in the state are doing that right now.
When you're done with this thing, can you send a crew over to the aunt's house?
Anna?
Thanks for coming.
Franklin Birch.
My wife's in here.
Honey?
Her name's Nancy.
Detective Loki is-
- Honey?
These photos are better than the ones my husband gave you.
You can see her eyes more clearly.
So did we pass?
I'm sorry, what did you say?
The poly thing, the lie detector we took this morning.
Did we pass?
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Yes. We appreciate your cooperation.
It's embarrassing, all the-- All this fuss.
Everyone's gonna think we're crazy... when those two come out of hiding, wherever they are.
Do you have some reason to believe they ran away?
No.
They're happy.
They must have run away.
I think they must have run away. Right?
Your police captain told me that you've solved every case... that you've ever been assigned.
Is that right?
Sorry.
I am so sorry.
Do you have children, detective?
I'm gonna find your daughter.
We believe they came back here after they left you at the Birches' yesterday.
They were looking for Anna's red whistle.
Right.
I read your statement.
I'm Detective Loki.
I'm heading up the investigation into your daughter's disappearance.
Please sit down.
My son already told you that the guy was inside the RV just watching them, right?
We haven't found any physical evidence inside the RV.
Or his aunt's house where he lives.
- Nothing?
- Alex Jones... unfortunately has the I.Q. of a 10-year-old.
There's no way someone with the I.Q. of a 10-year-old... could abduct two girls in broad daylight, and then... somehow make them disappear.
Well, how can he drive an RV?
If he can't answer a question....
Well, he has a legal Pennsylvania license.
And he ran, right?
They said he tried to run away.
Why--? Why? Why would he run?
I've just spent ten hours questioning this boy.
Okay? I hear what you're saying.
Did you give him a lie detector? You gave us a lie- - Did you give him one?
I understand what you're asking me.
Yes, we did.
We gave him a lie detector, and there's no way of....
A lie detector doesn't work if you don't understand the questions.
Well, maybe he wasn't on his own.
How could he drive an RV...
- if he has an I.Q. of a 10-year-old?
- We're considering all possibilities.
- I don't think you are considering--
- I hear what you're saying.
Listen to me.
Shut the fuck up for a fucking second!
This is what I'm gonna need you to do for me.
I need you to calm down.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please listen to me for a second.
Mr. Dover, I understand this is an incredibly hard time.
But I have every uniformed police officer in this state looking for Anna.
I don't understand what any of this means.
They said he tried to get away.
I don't understand why he would try to run away.
We're considering all possibilities, Mr. Dover.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm not crossing anybody off my list.
Just... let me do my job.
Detective!
- Shit.
He stays in custody until my daughter's found, right?
Right?
We have a 48 hour hold on him unless we bring charges.
Well, charge him with something. Charge him.
- Mr. Dover, I understand what you're--
- Two girls have got to be worth... whatever rule you break to keep that asshole in custody.
I know you can't promise me anything. I understand. But I'm asking you to be sure.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
So you're positive he's innocent, but you want to hold him?
Anna's father was a mess this morning.
- I understand.
But it's not gonna happen.
- I was asking for one more day.
Fuck you. Oh, no.
Find his daughter, he'll forgive you.
You don't, he's gonna hate you anyway.
So, what's next?
- I'm knocking on doors all night.
- You're coming up on 24 hours missing...
- and you have exactly shit.
- I've got nine level-three sex offenders... living within a 10-mile radius of Fairmont Circle. So if you don't mind.
- Then go. - Yeah.
Go.
It's right here.
Look, I'm staying straight, okay?
No, it's- - Hey, look. Look, I know you're--
- Like yourself some German porn, huh?
Look, I was--
Father! Open up! It's the police!
Father.
Father.
Mind if I take a look around?
Fucking drunk.
What the fuck?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Please, God, God!
What's the name of your buddy down there? What's the name?
- I don't know his name.
- You don't know his name?
- I don't know his name.
- You know what?
I spent six years in Huntington Boys' Home.
You know the Huntington Boys' Home, right?
Hurting a fuck like you'd be a treat. Why don't you tell me his name?
He didn't tell me his name.
He came to me for a confession.
He said he'd killed 16 children.
He bragged about it.
I convinced him to come back here.
He said he'd kill more.
Sixteen children, huh?
All right, let's go, you fucking chicken-hawk.
- Hey. - They're letting him go.
- What?
- The man.
The police said they're letting him go today.
Oh, okay. I'll take care of it.
- Dad?
- Keep searching.
Where are you going?
They want you to write your whole name.
That's good.
Good job. Now you give it to the man.
All right. Come on. I don't want you minding these people out here.
Don't talk to them.
You've got nothing to say to them.
- Hey! - Alex!
Back, back.
Let them walk.
- Alex!
- Come on, Alex.
You took those kids, didn't you?
I just want to talk.
He's a free man, I'm a free man!
- No! - Hey!
Tell me what you did with them! Tell me!
They didn't cry until I left them.
What did you say? What did you say?
No. no! No!
Fucking get off him!
God. Get up!
Get him down! Get him down!
- Move back! Move back! - Come on.
Please, just let us go. Thanks for nothing.
We're fine. Thank you.
Now, I know your dad was a guard at Graterford.
And I've got a daughter of my own, so... we're gonna pretend this never happened.
And as for Alex Jones, he has orders not to leave the commonwealth.
- What?
- Sir, I need you to go home. All right?
- I need you to go home.
- What about what I just told you?
Why aren't you sending someone to arrest this guy?
Tell Detective Loki what you just told me, and he'll definitely look into it.
Go ahead.
That asshole you promised me you'd keep in custody, right? And you didn't.
When I grabbed him in the parking lot, he said right to my face:
"They didn't cry until I left them." Right to my fucking face.
He said that to you in the parking lot?
Right now, yeah. What did I just say?
In the parking lot.
Before you grabbed me off him.
Did anyone else hear it besides you?
I don't know.
It was quiet. He said it to me.
He wanted me to know.
- Are you sure he said that?
- What?
Are you sure that's what he said?
Jesus Christ, you think I'm making this up? Why would I make this up?
- Hey, hey, hey. - No. No.
- Think about it. Why would I make this up?
- I'm not saying that.
I'm just asking you a couple questions.
I will talk to him.
- No, don't talk to him! Arrest him!
- Mr. Dover.
What did I fucking tell you?
What did I tell you?
One more day.
You sure you didn't say anything to Mr. Dover in the parking lot today?
Anything he could have misinterpreted or...?
I was right there.
They didn't say anything to each other.
Man just attacked the boy.
Nothing like "get away from me" or "help" or... anything like that?
No.
Can I speak to Alex alone for a minute?
It's all right, sweetie.
I'll be right in the next room.
You love your aunt, don't you, Alex?
If you know something you're not telling us, she could go to jail for a very long time.
Do you want that for her?
After everything she's done for you?
No.
Mr. Dover, it's Detective Loki.
- Have you arrested him?
- Look, I just came from Alex Jones.
He said he didn't say anything to you in the lot.
I pushed him pretty hard, he didn't budge.
We can't waste any more time on this guy.
You're gonna have to trust me.
I'll let you know if I have anything new--
Fucking A.
The zipper on her coat was broken, and I told her it didn't matter... because we were just gonna go right down the street.
- No.
No. - Why hasn't she come home?
It's been three days.
Why can't you make her come home?
I don't understand.
I don't understand. It's been too long.
Please make her come home.
- Please.
- How many of these...?
How many of these? How many of these? How many?
- I don't know!
- Okay, that's all right.
Just take one.
Here.
No.
I just want to sleep. I just want to go to sleep.
You....
You made me feel so safe.
You told us that you could protect us from everything.
Oh, God.
I'm gonna go out and help the police.
Just keep an eye on your mother.
Your sister needs us to be brave for her.
Be brave for her.
Be a grown-up for me, okay?
Can you do that?
Can you do that?
I know you're scared.
Look at me. Come here.
I know you're scared.
It's gonna be okay.
The former is a reason why we should be very patient... the latter why we should be very penitent when we are afflicted.
He reminds him that trouble and affliction are what we have all reason... to expect in this world.
Man is brought into trouble... not as man, but as sinful man, who was in transgression.
Man born in sin and therefore born to trouble.
Come on. Come on, Tucker.
Jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid an egg
The Batmobile lost its wheels
Joker got away, hey
Jingle bells, Batman smells Robin laid an egg
Jingle bells, Batman smells Robin laid an egg
Alex.
Lost its wheel
That song. Where did you hear those words?
Did you bring a change of clothes like I told you?
You gonna tell me why?
It's better if I just show you.
Show me what?
Didn't you used to live here?
Close the door. Lock it.
Oh, my God. What did you do?
- Keller, what the hell?
- I heard him singing the song... they were singing. Swear to God, Franklin.
The same fucking song.
- And I told you what he said in the parking lot.
- Then we take him to the police.
No. The police won't do shit.
He'll just clam up and act crazy like last time.
Someone has to make him talk. Someone.
Shit, man. This ain't right.
What if you're wrong?
- I'm not wrong.
- But what if you're wrong?
What if you only heard what you wanted to hear?
What if--? Man, I want my daughter back...
- as much as you do, but it ain't right.
- Franklin, Franklin!
We hurt him until he talks, or they're gonna die.
- This ain't-- - No.
No.
We hurt him until he talks or they're gonna die.
That's the choice.
That's the choice you have to make.
I've made my choice.
I know what I heard.
He's not a person anymore.
No, he stopped being a person when he took our daughters.
I need your help.
This is your last chance.
I know you're scared.
I know you wanna go home.
All right?
I know.
I don't want to hurt you. I don't.
I'm gonna take the tape off, and I want you to tell me where they are.
Hey. Come on.
Did you see my glasses?
What?
I can't see.
If you're not gonna talk, Alex, I'm gonna have to hurt you.
Tell me where they are.
Where are they?
Tell me where they are!
I'm out here at a house on Fairmont Circle.
That house the RV was parked in front of.
It's been on the market a couple months.
I'm gonna track the owners, see if they know anything.
Got any new info on that corpse we found in the priest's basement?
No DNA, dental, or fingerprint matches.
Nothing.
Priest is sticking to the story too.
All right.
Same person who took him, took those girls. I'm sure of it.
Wearing out the tape, I guess.
I watch it every day after breakfast.
It's the only video I have of him.
It was before your time.
Twenty-six years ago, August 19th.
I took a nap in the afternoon, and when I woke up, Barry was gone.
No one could ever tell me what happened to him.
He was playing in the front yard... just a few feet from where they say that RV was parked.
What do you think that means?
I'm more interested in what you think that means.
I don't think we'll ever know.
It's just like Barry.
No one took them. Nothing happened.
They're just gone.
- He's gonna say to you. - Yeah, right.
How you doing, Father?
I'm getting better.
So Detective Chemelinski tells me that you have some specifics... about the crime you claim that guy committed.
The abductor.
He was... waging a war against God.
Great. That's great.
I thought you said he had something specific. I'm not--
Tell him how he took the kids.
He said... he took them in daylight.
Sometimes... more than one child at a time.
- He said that?
Did he say he was with anybody?
He did it alone?
He....
He said he had a family.
That's it?
All right.
Informative.
You said they cried when you left them. Look at me.
You said they cried when you left them!
Now tell me!
Where is she?
Tell me where they are!
Just tell me. Just tell me and I'll stop.
I'll stop as soon as you tell me.
Just tell me where they are.
Why won't you tell me?
Why won't you just fucking tell us?
He knows. He knows.
I can see it in his eyes.
He fucking knows.
I know you know!
Why aren't you fucking telling me?
Why?
Fine.
- Get him up. Get him up. - Oh, God.
Get up. Get up. Get up!
You gonna make me use this?
You gonna tell us? If you don't, I'm gonna use this.
Fine.
You're doing this to yourself.
Just tell us.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Where's my daughter?
Four days have passed since Anna Dover and Joy Birch... were last seen by their families.
The two girls, aged 6 and 7, are believed to have been... playing on this street when they disappeared without a trace.
As you can see, despite the cold... a lot of people have turned out to show their support.
Police are asking that anyone with any information....
Where have you been?
I was searching for her in the woods.
I'm okay.
God.
Franklin, what is it?
I just need a minute.
What the fuck?
Get off of me!
And this is who police are saying is a person of interest... in the investigation of the two missing girls.
This unidentified man... who was last seen at last night's candlelight vigil, fled on foot... when the investigating detective attempted to question him.
Police caution the public not to approach this man... but to call police immediately if they do see him.
Thanks, John, for that update.
And now for the weather.
We should expect heavy rain into the early evening and--
Look, Keller, I mean, just think about it.
Why would the police be looking for this man if they didn't think he did it?
They did it together.
They know each other.
I fucking told you.
Jones looked me in the eye and he said:
"They only cried when I left them."
He left them with someone, and he knows where this guy is.
Holly Jones' dog got hit on Southward Street.
Alex took the dog for a walk night before last. Never came home.
His aunt didn't want to tell us when we called her about this morning.
She said it would get him into trouble or some shit.
- You said you'd keep him under surveillance.
- You said the guy was innocent.
I thought the guy from last night you said was our guy.
I don't have money in the budget for watching innocent people.
- You said you'd put him under surveillance.
- What do you want?
Keep your word. Give me a call, I would have been there all night.
I would know where he was now.
- I need to know where everybody is.
- All right, point made. Point made.
If you be clear, then I'll be clear.
I need to know where everybody is.
If you do something different, please tell me.
Tell me about your RV.
What do you do in your RV?
It's where I go... to be alone.
What music do you listen to in your RV... when you're alone?
Radio, tape.
The RV was parked over on Fairmont Circle?
No.
Is my aunt coming?
I- - I- - I....
Have you seen these girls?
- No.
- You take a look at them.
You seen these girls?
No.
Did you participate in any way in the abduction of those girls?
No.
Loki!
You got a call.
All right.
I called as soon as I saw the sketch on TV.
He comes in here every week and buys kids' clothes.
But he's always buying stuff in different sizes.
Caught him messing around with the mannequins once.
- What did he pay with?
- Cash.
All right, give me a call if you hear anything.
Okay.
It's been five days.
Maybe five days since they had a drink of water.
This could be the last night that matters.
Look, I'll call you after Nancy goes to sleep, all right?
Promise.
Where have you been all this time?
What the hell were you thinking?
You tell anyone?
Did you?
I wanna see him.
Please help me.
Could you help me find my little girl?
Got a picture.
See?
This my baby.
You see her?
Her name is Joy.
And....
This is a stuffed animal we got her when she was 2... because she's afraid to sleep by herself.
Please... tell me where my little girl is.
Please tell me where my little girl is.
I know you're gonna tell me. I know you're gonna tell me.
I know.
Help me.
Help me.
Franklin, can you close the door to the--?
Nancy!
What the fuck you doing?
Goddamn it! Damn!
Let it go. Let it go!
You untied him?
That was close.
- What is it? What happened?
- Get Franklin. I need to show you something.
Did he say anything new?
He will soon. You'll see.
No light gets in.
There's barely enough room to sit down inside.
Shower still works, but we control from out here.
And I rigged the water heater so it either comes out scalding or freezing.
And, uh, you talk to him through this.
It's to remind us... in case we start feeling sorry for him.
My God.
I can't hurt him any more without killing him, so this is the only way.
Have you lost your mind, Keller?
Do you have a better idea, Franklin?
Do you?
Go ahead. Let him out, if you want.
I'm not gonna stop you.
If that's what you really want, you go ahead.
You think someone's looking out for our girls the way you're looking out for him?
I hope.
It's been five days now, man.
We're running out of time.
- You don't even know it's him.
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't. I know you.
You don't. - I do.
Look, I want my baby back... as much as you miss Anna.
And despite what you think about me... I would die for my daughter.
But this ain't right.
This has to stop.
Well, then you better get to work.
I'd start with that wall there.
Franklin.
Stop.
Franklin, think of Joy.
I need to get out of this place, Ralph.
Everything in this house just makes me want to throw up.
Your dad's building?
There is no way I'm staying in that crackhouse.
It's disgusting.
We're not gonna help Keller, but we won't stop him either.
Let him do what he needs to.
We don't know about it anymore.
Eliza?
Eliza, open the door!
- Is she in there?
Honey?
- Eliza. - Get out of the way! Hey--
Fuck you both. Next time you plan on leaving me here alone... maybe you could try at least telling me where you're going.
Ralph?
Anna?
Mom?
- Mom? What are you doing?
- Anna was here.
It's freezing in here.
Mom. Hey, Morn! Sit down.
I'm gonna close the window.
And she wasn't here.
And then I heard a sound from my room, and I--
I came in and the window was open. And....
And it wasn't open before.
And then- - And then Ralph, he came in... and he looked and....
And then....
Then I don't know.
Aren't you gonna write this down?
The basement. I didn't check the basement. We need to check the basement.
I'll show you.
The kids know they're not allowed down here.
They're not supposed to come down here, but I don't know.
My husband likes to be prepared for emergencies.
Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?
I was gonna ask you.
He's been out searching with the police for Anna.
Which you should be doing right now.
Does he always stay out this late?
Yes, he stays out this late when he's looking for my daughter... since my daughter has been gone. Yes!
Shit.
Hey, go ar- - Go around.
Fuck.
Come on, Mr. Dover.
Shit.
Why are you following me?
Get in the car.
Why are you following me?
Where were you going just now?
I parked at the liquor store.
I have a bottle of liquor.
You're the shit-hot detective.
Work it out.
I actually meant before that.
You were walking in the opposite direction across the parking lot.
Towards Campello Street.
Yeah, well, I haven't had a drink in nine and a half years.
Figured if I walked around the parking lot a while... by the time they opened I'd stop wanting it that bad.
And then I saw you.
Sort of helped me make up my mind.
There's a bag of lye in your basement that's half empty.
Your wife thinks you've been helping us... but we both know that's not true.
I used the lye to bury our dog last year.
And "helping the cops" sounds better than "I've been driving aimlessly in my truck... because I don't know what the fuck else to do."
Is that what you were doing last Saturday night?
Probably. Am I a suspect?
No, I'm only asking because you assaulted a man who's now missing.
I heard about that. What happened?
Thought you had him under surveillance.
I'm gonna assume you're asking me because you have no idea.
- Didn't think it was something I'd get away with.
- It's not.
It couldn't be he skipped town because the asshole is guilty.
Couldn't be that. Because that would mean it would be your fault, right?
Mr. Dover?
- Mr. Dover?
- What?
You need to take care of yourself and your wife.
That's the best thing you can do right now.
That little girl is gonna need you when she comes home.
Kids gone for more than a week have half as good a chance of being found... and after a month, almost none are.
Not alive.
All right?
So forgive me for doing everything I can--
You know what? It hasn't been a fucking week.
- You're right. It's day fucking six!
Day six! - Hasn't been a week.
And every day she's wondering why I'm not there to fucking rescue her!
- All right.
- Do you understand that?
Me! Not you!
Not you! But me!
- Every day!
- All right.
So forgive me for not going home to have a good night's rest!
Now, why don't you look for my fucking daughter rather than fighting--?
- Don't follow me. - Hey. Hey.
Mr. Dover. Mr. Dover.
Don't think I'd let you get behind the wheel after you've been drinking, do you?
I'm gonna walk. You look for my daughter.
Daddy. Daddy.
Look, Daddy, we found it.
Anna, where was it?
I'm not Alex.
I'm not Alex.
What?
What are you saying? What?
- What?
- I'm....
I'm not Alex.
- What, you're not Alex?
What? - I'm not Alex.
I don't understand.
Just talk to me.
I waited and he never came.
Come on. No more riddles.
Just fucking tell me.
He never came. I just....
I'll let you go home to your aunt if you tell me where they are.
I just wanted to play.
Don't make me do this to you.
- And he never came.
- What were you doing?
He never came.
I just wanted to--
Why are you making me do this?
Help me, God.
I'm relying on your almighty power and your infinite mercies and promises.
I hope to obtain pardon for my sins.
Fuck me.
No noise. You shut up.
You make any noise, I'm gonna turn on that tap.
Hey, rise and shine.
I'm not gonna find two girls here, am I?
Fuck you.
What about Alex Jones?
What about him?
I came here to drink.
I don't want to drink in front of my wife.
Look, my father left me this building, all right?
You mind giving me a tour?
- Why didn't you tell me about this place?
- I didn't think it mattered.
Everything matters.
It's all pretty much like this.
I'm gonna renovate soon.
Yeah. Not as organized as your basement, huh?
What's up with all the survivor gear in there?
Pray for the best, prepare for the worst.
At least we agree there.
Come on, hurry up.
Oh, shit.
Hello?
The guy you were looking for was just here.
He saw me watching him and ran.
You get a plate?
Go home, Mr. Dover.
Morning.
Why'd you run away from me the other night?
I've never seen you before.
You sure you have the right house?
You doing some shopping at the Value Mall lately?
Why, is it a crime to shop there?
I can't afford to buy suits from Brooks Brothers.
Yeah, I know.
You bought children's clothes.
Did I?
Must've been in a hurry.
Do you have children?
No.
I don't have....
Have anything--
Come on!
Christ!
Come here. Come here.
Stay.
If you move, I'll put a bullet through your fucking head.
This is 13-40.
I need additional unit for search. 437 Carrol Street.
Possible kidnapping victims on the premises.
Anna?
Fucking....
Anna?
Joy?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Ah, fuck.
So we've taken photographs of some of the clothing we found in the suspect's house.
Mr. Dover.
Mr. Dover, is your wife here?
She's not coming.
If you can't make a positive ID on these photographs... I'm gonna need her to come in and take a look at them.
Have a seat.
So he confessed?
He said he killed them?
We were hoping he was lying, but....
We haven't even found any bodies, Mr. Dover, but... the Birches positively identified two pieces of clothing.
So I'm gonna need you to tell me if you recognize anything.
No.
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
Okay.
No.
That's her....
That's her sock.
You....
You wasted time.
You wasted time following me.
You let this happen.
Don't talk to them.
Eliza told me they're dead.
- Is it true?
- No.
She said they found their bloody clothes--
Don't you dare tell your mother that.
Don't you dare, you understand me?
Now, I need you to listen to me.
I need you to stay for a couple of days.
Make sure she does not watch the news.
When the paper comes, throw it the fuck away.
Listen to me!
We do not give up on your sister!
We do not!
I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna bring her home.
We do not give up.
You're gonna bring her home?
She's dead. You can't do anything.
You leave me and Mom here while you go out, getting fucking drunk!
- You think I can't smell on you?
- Shut up!
How long has this Bob Taylor been working... on this map?
Three and a half hours.
Think this is gonna lead to the bodies?
I sure as shit don't.
Do me a favor, captain.
Go fuck yourself.
We weren't getting anywhere questioning him.
That looks more like a maze than a map.
He's got a thing for mazes.
I'm going home.
Call me if something happens.
Give me that card, John.
The key card.
All right, it's done now.
Tell me what you're drawing.
You said you're drawing a map.
That looks like a puzzle.
You tell me what you're drawing.
Tell me what you're drawing.
- I can't! - Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, shit!
Yes, you can! Yes, you can!
- Take him! Come on!
- Yes, you can! Yes, he can!
Oh, shit! Gun! Gun!
Bob, don't!
Put the gun down!
Bob. Bob, put the gun down!
Bob. Bob, no!
No! No, no, no!
Fuck.
Go call a fucking R.A.!
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come... thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses... as we--
As we for--
He explain this before he ate the bullet?
I'm sorry.
Fuck your sorry.
Save it for the girls' parents.
I don't know what to do, Alex.
I don't know what to do anymore.
And what's completely fucked up about all this is I know you know where they are.
I think we're done.
They're in the maze.
- That's where you'll find them.
- What?
What did you say?
In the maze.
What--? What maze?
Where is it?
Where is the maze?
Where do I find it?
Alex?
Alex, listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay? Just tell me where the maze is.
Just tell me, man.
Where is the maze?
Come on, tell me.
Just tell me where the maze is, okay?
Come on, don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me now.
Don't fuck with me, goddamn it.
Tell me where they are!
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Something's gonna get to you, man.
Something's gonna get to you! Something's gonna get to you!
Just a minute!
- Can I help you?
- Morning, ma'am.
I'm Keller Dover.
My little girl was abducted with a friend.
What do you want?
I guess I haven't thought this through too good, huh? I....
I been thinking a lot about what happened to your nephew.
And I know I scared him the other day at the police station, and....
What I'm trying to say is I kind of feel responsible for him running away.
You wanna come on in?
My husband and I were very devout at one time.
Spent our summers driving around in that camper with our son... handing out pamphlets.
Spreading the good word.
After our son died of cancer... we started seeing things differently.
Adopting Alex helped... but we never got over it.
I'm sorry.
You look very tired.
Yeah, I don't sleep much.
I....
I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.
I'm sorry.
Alex never talks very much... so when people come over here, I hardly know what to say.
He doesn't talk much?
Well, he talks. Good morning, good night, that sort of thing.
Hard to get too much more than that out of him.
Had an accident when he was little.
After that he started choosing his words a little too carefully.
What--? What kind of accident did he--?
My husband kept snakes.
It wasn't that bad what happened, but Alex had a fear of them and....
That's not my favorite memory.
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
Can I get you a cup of tea, Mr. Dover?
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you would have known about that already.
I say it's better this way.
You know, that awful man... he would have spent years on Death Row just watching TV and getting fat.
Well.
Least I don't have to worry about losing you to P.S.P.
When forensics is finished with the guy's place, we're gonna deploy the cadaver dogs.
Look, kid, we can't always save the day.
All right? We're just cops.
Janitors.
So you lost this one, all right?
Look, you want fulfillment, you need to find a girl.
You know? Start a family, have some kids.
Let it go.
Right.
- Hey, it's Rich. We found something.
Guys, let us have a look.
Two kid-sized department store mannequins, with their heads caved in.
I talked to our lab. They told me the blood we sampled from the plastic containers?
Pig's blood.
Let's get this covered up.
It's supposed to snow soon.
Hurry up, okay?
It's like he's play-acting.
Case in point:
Except for the items ID'd by the Dovers and the Birches... all the kids' clothes that we found still had tags on them.
And that maze book that we found, he made it.
Photocopies, pictures from this book we found in the attic.
- Ex-FBI agent wrote that.
- "Finding the Invisible Man."
It's about a theoretical suspect he believed was responsible for a bunch of child abductions.
It's totally discredited, I guess, but I read some of it.
Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.
He ran away after three weeks.
The captor drugged him on some sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.
He never remembered and they never caught the guy.
Okay, so, he read the book and decided he was taken by the Invisible Man.
Now he's doing his best imitation, right?
Yeah, he was doing his best imitation.
He killed himself last night.
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.
Taylor drew this. It's a map to the bodies.
It's a map to the bodies.
We found the same design on a pendant we pulled off that corpse.
- There's a connection, okay?
- Connection is... that it's the last maze in the book.
It's unsolvable.
There's no way out.
Your corpse is another wannabe, read the book.
What are you saying to me, Rich? What?
What are you saying, that this guy is a fake?
You're saying that the girls are still out there somewhere?
How did Bob Taylor get those clothes?
How did--? How did the parents... positively ID those clothes?
That I can't reconcile.
You can't reconcile that?
Just keep knocking on doors, looking in windows.
Hey, why is that there?
Bag that.
Will do, sir. Right away.
Yes?
Yeah, this is she.
What?
Oh, my God.
Wait. Is she--?
Ralph!
Keller!
Keller! We need to go to the hospital!
They found Joy, but not Anna!
They didn't find Anna!
Maybe she'll know where Anna is!
Please, we have to go!
Keller!
Eliza's not picking up.
- You should text her.
- Nobody gets beyond this point.
- Don't touch me.
- Miss! Wait a minute--
- It's okay.
- Nancy.
- Grace.
They'll find Anna. I know they will.
I know they will.
I know.
- How is she?
- Is she awake?
Joy, were you far from our street?
How far from the street were you, Joy? Joy?
- You can't be doing this.
- How long did it take you--?
- Let me ask a question!
- Keller!
The detective will be back in just a minute.
You need to wait.
- She's been drugged.
- Joy.
Sweetheart, just let us know she's alive, okay?
Can you just nod your head, baby? Just nod your head?
Baby? Can you give us a nod? Can you nod your head for us, please?
Joy?
You were there.
What?
I--? I was where?
It put tape on our mouths.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.
Mommy and Daddy are here now, okay?
You're all right.
- Excuse me.
- You're all right now.
I said nobody's allowed in that room but her family.
- Hey! Where you going?
- Keller?
- Hey! Where's he going?
- I don't know.
Hey!
Call downstairs. Don't let him go.
Stop that car!
Get his truck!
Stop it! Hey!
I've got you, you fucker.
I know where you're going.
I know where you're going.
Hello again.
Hey. I was hoping you'd let me do some penance.
- For what?
- Scaring you the other day at the, uh....
- At the police station.
- You already apologized for that.
I know, I was just-- You know, I thought maybe you, uh....
You could use some help around the--
I noticed your door here needs fixing, so I brought my tools and, uh....
Oh, I see.
I burned myself.
Feel a little icky today.
But I'm glad you want to talk some more.
No need to make excuses.
You come on in and make me a cup of tea.
Come on in.
I don't want to have to hurt you.
I know they were here.
Put your hands on your head and turn around.
Do it.
I'm just gonna go.
Don't touch that bag.
Put your hands on your head.
Come over here to this counter.
Come on.
Top drawer.
Open it.
Put them on.
You don't know me, Mr. Dover.
But believe me when I tell you, I won't let you go.
You don't have to drink all of it.
About a third should do for a man your size.
- Something to make you more manageable.
- Forget it.
Drink it, Mr. Dover, or I'll kill you right here in my kitchen and bring your daughter in here...
- and have her scrub your brains off the floor.
- Where is she?
Drink.
Just let me see her.
- You want to see her?
- Yes.
That's your ticket to your daughter right there.
Little more, Mr. Dover. Little more.
Good, isn't it?
That's my darling husband's recipe.
Now go on out back.
Let me see her.
Take it out of your pocket.
Put it in the sink.
Put it in the disposal.
Put your car keys on the table.
Put your car keys on the table.
That's right.
Go over to the Trans-Am over there.
The car over there.
Come on, move it.
Get over there.
The look on your face.
My husband used to have the very same look until we took Alex.
He was the first kid we ever took.
His name was Jimmy. Or Barry.
Can't remember. Doubt he can, either.
So many names.
Forgot all about Bobby Taylor until I read about him in the paper.
Get in the driver's seat.
Open the door and get in the car.
Making children disappear is the war we wage with God.
Makes people lose their faith.
Turns them into demons like you.
Had to slow down since my husband disappeared.
But I do what I can.
Start the car.
Start the car.
Keep trying.
Back up. Slowly.
Come on. Back up.
Come on.
Stop.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Get out.
Think you should know.
Alex never laid a hand on those girls.
Just wanted to take them for a ride in the camper.
I was the one who decided they should stay.
Take a look.
Maybe your daughter's under there.
You never know.
Anna.
I had the girls down there while the police came poking around.
Should have left them down there.
I was so lonely without Alex.
- Now get in there.
- What?
Get in.
You want me to get in there, you're gonna have to shoot me.
I'm not gonna get in there just because you asked.
God!
Go on. Get in there.
That's right.
Make yourself a tourniquet.
Just might last 24 hours.
I'd love for you to still be alive when I dump your daughter's body down there.
Wait. No, wait, wait! Wait!
Hey. I need you to go over to Holly Jones'.
- She needs to be notified.
- No. I need to find Dover.
- Come on. You're done with Dover.
- You want me to go to Holly Jones'?
I want you to go to Holly Jones' and notify her, please.
Oh, God.
Almighty God, protect my girl.
Mrs. Jones?
Mrs. Jones?
Show me your hands right now.
Don't move and show me your fucking hands right now.
Stop right now!
Show me your fucking hands.
Do not move and show me your hands.
Make sure they cremate me.
I sure as hell don't want to be buried in some box.
Both hands!
Right now! Right now!
Fuck!
Anna.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Come on. Come on, Anna.
Anna. Come on.
Stay with me, Anna. Stay with me, huh?
Stay with me, Anna.
Stay with me, Anna! It's all right.
It's all right, come on.
Go, move, move, move!
Don't die. Don't die.
It's okay. It's okay.
Honey. You're okay.
Hey! Help!
Detective Loki?
I hope we're not intruding.
No.
She's doing real good.
She's gonna be up and around in a few days, aren't you, buddy?
She just wanted to come and say thank you and hi to her hero.
Would you mind giving me a minute?
Say goodbye, Joy. - Thank you.
- Bye.
- I'll be out in a minute.
Say goodbye, Anna.
She found her whistle?
No.
She keeps insisting that Joy helped her find it... on Thanksgiving before they were taken.
But I think she's just confused.
I got her a new one.
He hasn't contacted me.
I know you don't....
I know you probably don't believe that, but he hasn't.
I believe you.
Do you think you're gonna find him?
And he'll go to jail.
Probably.
Anyway.
Thank you for everything.
Oh, God.
I miss him.
He- - He did what he had to do to find Anna... and I thank God for that.
He's a good man.
Bye.
That's it. Let's pack it up.
- You all done for the night?
- Yeah, the ground's frozen solid.
It's gonna take weeks to excavate the entire property.
Just found some dead snakes and shit.
Pray for the best, prepare for the worst, yeah?
Night.
Night.
Shut her down.
Yeah, I got it.

CLASS M PLANET NIBIRU
Damn it, man!
That was our ride! You just stunned our ride!
Oh, great.
Run!
What the hell did you take?
I have no idea, but they were bowing to it.
Kirk to Shuttle One.
Locals are out of the kill zone.
You are clear.
Repeat.
Spock, get in there, neutralize the volcano and let's get out of here.
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain the shuttle wasn't built for this kind of heat.
Captain, did the indigenous life forms see you?
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.
The Prime Directive clearly states there can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilizations.
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running through the jungle wearing a disguise!
Now drop off your super ice cube and let's go!
Kirk out!
You're good.
If we're gonna do this, we've got to do it now!
This ash is killing our coils.
You sure you don't want me to go instead?
That would be highly illogical as I am already outfitted...
Spock, I was kidding.
-You got this.
-Guys! We have to go! Now!
They're trying to kill us!
They're trying to kill us, Jim!
I'll see you in 90 seconds.
Do it, do it!
Prerequisite change, 2-7-3...
ENGINE OVERHEATING
I can't hold this position.
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.
Negative.
This is our only chance to save this species.
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.
Pull him back up. Now!
Spock, are you okay?
I am, surprisingly, alive. Stand by. We have to get him back.
I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.
We have to abandon the shuttle.
-We can't just leave him, Sulu!
-We don't have a choice!
Uhura, I'm sorry.
Spock, we're going back to the Enterprise.
We'll get you out of there.
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.
You've got to make it to the Enterprise on your own.
Wonderful!
-Uhura!
You ready to swim?
-I'm ready.
Jim!
Jim!
The beach is that way!
I know!
We're not going to the beach!
Oh, no, no, no!
I hate this!
I know you do!
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean?
We've been down here since last night!
The salt water's gonna ruin the...
Scotty!
Where's Spock?
Still in the volcano, sir.
Captain on the bridge!
Lieutenant, do we have an open channel to Mr. Spock?
The heat's frying his comms, but we still have contact.
Spock?
I have activated the device, Captain.
When the countdown is complete, the reaction should render the volcano inert.
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!
Do we have use of the transporters?
-Negative, sir.
-Not with these magnetic fields.
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.
Give me one way to do it.
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.
-If we got closer...
-Hold on, wee man!
You're talking about an active volcano!
Sir, if that thing erupts, I cannae guarantee we can withstand the heat!
I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude.
Our shuttle was concealed by the ash cloud, but the Enterprise is too large.
If utilized in a rescue effort, it would be revealed to the indigenous species.
Spock, nobody knows the rules better than you, but there has got to be an exception.
None. Such action violates the Prime Directive.
Shut up, Spock!
We're trying to save you, damn it!
Doctor, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Spock, we're talking about your life!
The rule cannot be broken...
Spock!
Try to get him back online.
Ninety seconds to detonations.
If Spock were here and I were there, what would he do?
He'd let you die.
Spock!
You all right?
Captain, you let them see our ship.
He's fine.
-Bridge to Captain Kirk.
-Yes, Lieutenant.
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?
Safely and soundly.
Please notify him that his device has successfully detonated.
You hear that?
Congratulations, Spock.
You just saved the world.
You violated the Prime Directive.
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us.
Big deal.

I can save her.
What did you say?
Your daughter.
I can save her.
Who are you?
Oh, Jim.
Come on, let it go.
Jim!
You're not actually gonna answer that, are you?
SAN FRANCISCO STARFLEET HQ
Spock, I'm telling you, this is why he called. I can feel it. Your feeling aside, I consider it highly unlikely that we will be selected for the new program.
Why else would Pike want to see us?
Forget about seniority.
They gave us the newest ship in the fleet.
I mean, who else are they gonna send out?
I can think of numerous possibilities.
A five-year mission, Spock!
That's deep space! That's uncharted territory!
Think how incredible that's gonna be.
Hey, ladies.
Jim Kirk.
-"Uneventful."
-Admiral?
It's the way you described the survey of Nibiru in your captain's log.
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time going over the details.
Tell me more about this volcano.
Data says it was highly volatile.
If it were to erupt, it would wipe out the planet.
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.
Something tells me it won't.
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.
Maybe our data was off.
Or maybe it didn't erupt because Mr. Spock detonated a cold fusion device inside it right after a civilization that's barely invented the wheel happened to see a starship rising out of their ocean!
That is pretty much how you describe it, is it not?
-Admiral...
-You filed a report?
Why didn't you tell me?
I incorrectly assumed that you would be truthful in your captain's log.
Yeah, I would have been if I didn't have to save your life.
A fact for which I am immeasurably grateful and the very reason I felt it necessary to take responsibility for the actions...
Take responsibility, yeah.
That'd be so noble, pointy, if you weren't also throwing me under the bus.
"Pointy"?
Is that a derogatory reference to...
Gentlemen.
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and observe, not to interfere.
Had the mission gone according to plan, Admiral, the indigenous species would never have been aware of our interference.
That's a technicality.
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?
I'm expressing multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.
To which are you referring?
Out.
You're dismissed, Commander.
You have any idea what a pain in the ass you are?
I think so, sir.
So tell me what you did wrong.
What's the lesson to be learned here?
Never trust a Vulcan.
Now, see, you can't even answer the question.
You lied.
On an official report, you lied.
You think the rules don't apply to you 'cause you disagree with them.
That's why you talked me into signing up in the first place. It's why you gave me your ship.
I gave you my ship because I saw a greatness in you.
And now, I see you haven't got an ounce of humility.
What was I supposed to do, let Spock die?
You're missing the point.
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?
I wouldn't have risked my First Officer's life in the first place!
You were supposed to survey a planet, not alter its destiny!
You violated a dozen Starfleet regulations and almost got everyone under your command killed.
Except I didn't!
You know how many crew members I've lost? Not one!
That's your problem, you think you're infallible!
You think you can't make a mistake.
It's a pattern with you!
-The rules are for other people!
-Some should be.
And what's worse is you using blind luck to justify your playing God!
Given the circumstances, this has been brought to Admiral Marcus's attention.
He convened a special tribunal, to which I was not invited.
You understand what Starfleet regulations mandate be done at this point.
They've taken the Enterprise away from you.
They're sending you back to the Academy.
Admiral, listen...
-No, I'm not going to listen.
Why should I listen? I'm not going to listen.
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!
I understand regulation, but every decision I've made...
No!
I can't listen!
You don't comply with the rules, you don't take responsibility for anything, and you don't respect the chair.
You know why?
Because you're not ready for it.

KELVIN MEMORIAL ARCHIVE
I'm going to need three titanium...
Radiation protection is required in this area.
TRANSMISSION SENT
How did you find me?
I know you better than you think I do.
The first time I found you was in a dive like this.
Remember that?
You got your ass handed to you.
No, I didn't.
-You don't?
-No, that's not what happened.
-That was an epic beating.
-No, it wasn't.
You had napkins hanging out of your nose.
Did you not?
Yeah, that was a good fight.
"A good fight."
I think that's your problem right there.
They gave her back to me.
The Enterprise.
Congratulations.
Watch your back with that First Officer, though.
Spock's not going to be working with me.
He's been transferred.
U.S.S. Bradbury.
You're going to be my First Officer.
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.
But every now and then I can make a good case.
What did you tell him?
The truth.
That I believe in you.
That if anybody deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.
I don't know what to say.
That is a first.
It's going to be okay, son.
"Emergency session, Daystrom."
That's us.
Yeah.
Suit up.
All Starfleet personnel, please be advised,
-new security protocols are in effect.
-Captain.
Not anymore, Spock.
First Officer.
I was demoted and you were reassigned.
It is fortunate that the consequences were not more severe.
You've got to be kidding me.
Captain, it was never my intention...
Not Captain.
I saved your life, Spock.
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.
Commander, I see now I should have alerted you to the fact that I submitted the report.
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion to follow the rules.
But you see, I can't do that.
Where I come from, if someone saves your life, you don't stab him in the back.
Vulcans cannot lie.
Then I'm talking to the half-human part of you.
All right?
Do you understand why I went back for you?
Commander Spock?
Frank Abbot, U.S.S. Bradbury.
Guess you're with me.
Yes, Captain.
The truth is I'm going to miss you.
Admiral Marcus, sir.
Thank you for convening on such short notice.
Be seated.
By now, some of you have heard what happened in London.
The target was a Starfleet data archive.
Now it's a damned hole in the ground, 42 men and women are dead.
One hour ago, I received a message from a Starfleet officer, who confessed to carrying out this attack, that he was being forced to do it by this man,
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.
And he is the man responsible for this act of savagery.
For reasons unknown, John Harrison has just declared a one-man war against Starfleet.
And under no circumstances are we to allow this man to escape Federation space.
You here tonight represent the senior command of all the vessels in the region.
And in the name of those we lost, you will run this bastard down.
This is a manhunt, pure and simple, so let's get to work.
Earth's perimeter sensors have not detected any warp signatures leaving the system, so we know he can't be far.
You will park your ships in a blockade formation then deploy search vehicles and landing parties to run down every lead.
This man has shown willingness to kill innocent people, so the rules of engagement are simple.
If you come across this man and fear for your life or the lives of those nearby, you are authorized to use deadly force on sight.
-What's in the bag?
-James, not now.
It doesn't seem odd to you that he'd target an archive?
It's like bombing a library.
Chris?
Everything okay there?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kirk is just acclimating to his new position as First Officer.
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.
Tomorrow's too late.
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.
Spit it out, son.
Don't be shy.
Why the archive?
All that information is public record.
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet, this could just be the beginning.
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?
Sir, in the event of an attack, protocol mandates that senior command gather captains and first officers at Starfleet H.Q., right here
-in this room.
-It is curious Harrison would commandeer a jumpship without warp capabilities...
Clear the room!
No!
We need an air defense team! Daystrom Conference Room!
-Let's go!
-Cover me!
-Target acquired.
-Take him out!
Watch my flank!
-Go, go, go!
-Cover me!
Fire!
Yeah?
Commander, Mr. Scott has found something in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.
He has asked to see us right away.
Captain! I found this in the crashed jumpship, sir.
-This is how the bastard got away. -What do you mean?
It's a portable transwarp beaming device.
Well, can you figure out where he went?
I already did, sir. And you're no gonna like it.
He's gone to the one place we... We just can't go.
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.
He's on Kronos, sir.
I request my command be reinstated and your permission to go after him.
Give us a minute.
-Kronos.
-Yes, sir.
So Harrison's gone to the Klingon homeworld.
-Is he defecting?
-We're not sure, sir.
He has taken refuge in the Ketha Province, a region uninhabited for decades.
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!
He knows if we even go near Klingon space, it'd be all-out war.
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.
Please, sir.
All-out war with the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.
If you ask me, it's already begun.
Since we first learned of their existence, the Klingon Empire has conquered and occupied two planets that we know of and fired on our ships half a dozen times.
They are coming our way.
London was not an archive. It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet designated Section 31.
They were developing defense technology and training our officers to gather intelligence on the Klingons and any other potential enemy who means to do us harm.
Harrison was one of our top agents.
Well, now he's a fugitive and I want to take him out.
Pike always said you were one of our best and brightest.
You should have heard him defend you.
He's the one who talked you into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?
Yes, sir.
Did he ever tell you who talked him into joining?
His death is on me.
And yours can't be.
Sir, please.
All I...
Mr. Spock, you said the province where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?
Affirmative, sir.
As part of our defensive strategy, 31 developed a new photon torpedo.
Long-range and untraceable, it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.
I don't want you hurt, but I want to take him out.
You park on the edge of the Neutral Zone, you lock onto Harrison's position, you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.
Permission to reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.
Granted.
Jim!
-Where were you?
-For what?
Your medical exam.
Ten hours ago, you were in a damn firefight.
-Now it's my duty as ship's...
-I'm fine, Bones.
The hell you are.
I'm fine.
Status report, Mr. Spock.
The Enterprise should be ready for launch by the time we arrive.
-Good. Good.
-Captain.
Thank you for requesting my reinstatement.
You're welcome.
As I am again your First Officer, it is now my duty to strongly object to our mission parameters.
Of course it is.
There is no Starfleet regulation that condemns a man to die without a trial, something you and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes at the Klingon homeworld goes against...
You yourself said the area's uninhabited.
There's only gonna be one casualty.
And in case you weren't listening, our orders have nothing to do with Starfleet regulation.
Wait a minute. We're firing torpedoes at the Klingons?
Regulations aside, this action is morally wrong.
Regulations aside, pulling your ass out of a volcano was morally right.
And I didn't win any points for that.
Whoa, Jim, calm down.
I'm not gonna take ethics lessons from a robot!
Reverting to name-calling suggests that you are defensive and therefore find my opinion valid.
I wasn't asking for your opinion.
Bones, get that thing off my face.
Captain, our mission could start a war with the Klingons and it is, by its very definition, immoral.
Perhaps you should take the requisite time to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.
Captain Kirk.
Science Officer Wallace.
I've been assigned to the Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.
These are my transfer orders.
You requested an additional science officer, Captain?
I wish I had.
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."
"Doctorate in applied physics
"specializing in advanced weaponry."
Impressive credentials.
Thank you.
But redundant now that I am back aboard the Enterprise.
And yet, the more the merrier.
-Have a seat, Doctor.
-Thank you.
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.
No! I'm not signing anything!
Now, get these bloody things off my ship!
Captain!
Is there a problem, Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir. I was just explaining to this gentleman that I cannae authorize any weapons on board this ship without knowing what's inside them.
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...
Report to the bridge.
Captain.
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns, but we need these torpedoes on board.
Due respect, sir, but photon torpedoes run on fuel. Now, I cannae detect the type of fuel that's in the compartments on these torpedoes because it's shielded.
Now, I asked for the specifications, but he said...
-It's classified.
-It's classified.
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"
Captain.
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
-Yes, sir.
Now if you'll excuse me, sir, I have a warp core to prime.
Get down!
Jim, your vitals are way off.
Report to the med bay.
Scotty!
I need you to approve those weapons.
Do you know what this is, Captain?
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.
-Do you know what this is?
-It's a warp core.
It's a radioactive catastrophe waiting to happen.
A subtle shift in magnetic output from, say, firing one or more of six dozen torpedoes with an unknown payload could set off a chain reaction which would kill every living thing on this ship.
Letting those torpedoes on board the Enterprise is the last straw!
-What was the first straw?
-What was the...
There are plenty of straws.
How about Starfleet confiscating my transwarp equation?
And now some madman's using it to hop across the galaxy!
Where do you think he got it from?
We have our orders, Scotty!
That's what scares me.
This is clearly a military operation.
Is that what we are now?
'Cause I thought we were explorers.
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.
Right, well, you leave me no choice but to resign my duties.
Come on, Scotty.
You're giving me no choice, sir. I will not stand by...
You're not giving me much of a choice.
Will you just make an exception and sign...
Do you accept my resignation or not?
I do!
I do.
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.
Jim, for the love of God, do not use those torpedoes.
Attention.
Warp core anti-matter containment check in three minutes.
Captain!
I'm so sorry about Admiral Pike.
We all are.
-Are you okay?
-Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.
Actually, Scotty just quit.
And your boyfriend's second-guessing me every chance he gets.
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.
It's just sometimes I want to rip the bangs off his head.
-You know, maybe it's me.
I... -It's not you.
It's not?
Wait, are you guys... Are you guys fighting?
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.
Oh, my God!
What is that even like?
Your ears burning?
Captain on the bridge!
Captain.
Mr. Chekov.
You've been shadowing Mr. Scott.
You are familiar with the engineering systems of this ship?
Affirmative, sir.
Good.
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.
Aye, Captain.
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.
Docking clamps one, two, and three are released.
All moorings retracted.
Lieutenant Uhura, open a shipwide channel.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chekov, how we looking down there?
-All systems nominal, Captain.
-Copy that.
Warp available at your command.
Thank you, Mr. Chekov.
-All right. Let's ride.
-Yes, sir.
Channel open, sir.
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
As most of you know, Christopher Pike, former captain of this ship and our friend,
is dead.
The man who killed him has fled our system and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld, somewhere he believes we are unwilling to go.
We are on our way there now.
Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential that our presence go undetected.
Tensions between the Federation and the Klingon Empire have been high.
Any provocation could lead to an all-out war.
I will personally lead a landing party to an abandoned city on the surface of Kronos where we will capture the fugitive, John Harrison, and return him to Earth so he can face judgment for his actions.
All right. Let's go get this son of a bitch.
Kirk out.
Captain, I believe you have made the right decision.
If I can be of assistance, I would be happy to accompany you on the away team.
You? Happy?
I was simply attempting to use your vernacular to convey an idea.
Thank you, Mr. Spock.
All personnel, prepare for the closing of payload bay doors.
Mr. Spock.
You startled me.
What are you doing, Doctor?
-Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
-You misunderstand.
What are you doing aboard this ship?
There is no record of you being assigned to the Enterprise.
Really?
That must be some sort of mistake.
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.
Except that you have lied about your identity.
Wallace is the surname of your mother.
I can only assume the Admiral is your father.
Mr. Spock.
I'm aware that I have no right to ask this of you. But please, he cannot know that I'm here...
Engineering manually dropped us out of warp, sir.
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!
The core overheated.
I had to activate the emergency stop.
It must be a coolant leak. I need time to find it.
-Sorry, Captain.
-Damn it.
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.
Twenty minutes, sir.
That's 20 minutes in enemy space we weren't counting on.
All right. We better hop to it.
-Where's Spock?
-Here, Captain.
You're coming with me to Kronos.
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?
-It's rusty, but it's good.
-Good, you're coming, too.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it, you two working together?
Absolutely not.
Unclear.
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.
Jim, you're not actually going down there, are you?
You don't rob a bank when the getaway car has a flat tire.
I'm sure engineering will have us all patched up by the time we get back.
Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?
Yes, Captain.
I'll do my best, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.
Once we're en route, I want you to transmit a targeted comm burst to Harrison's location.
You tell him you have a bunch of real big torpedoes pointed at his head and if he doesn't play nice, you're not afraid to use them.
-Is that a problem?
-No, sir.
I've just never sat in the chair before.
You're gonna do great.
Jim!
Wait!
You just sat that man down at a high-stakes poker game with no cards and told him to bluff.
Now Sulu's a good man, but he is no captain.
For the next two hours, he is.
And enough with the metaphors, all right?
That's an order.
Mr. Sulu, make sure that K'normian ship is ready to fly.
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.
Please have the trade ship we confiscated during the Mudd incident last month fueled and flight ready.
Captain Kirk is en route to you now.
Ready to deploy, Captain.
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.
-Look, if this thing goes south, there can be nothing tying us to Starfleet.
Unless of course you want to start a war, Mr. Hendorff.
-No, sir.
-No, sir.
Good.
Me, neither.
I am detecting a single life sign in the Ketha Province.
Given the information provided by Mr. Scott, this is most likely John Harrison.
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.
You let him know you mean business.
Aye, Captain.
Attention, John Harrison.
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
A shuttle of highly trained officers is on its way to your location.
If you do not surrender to them immediately, I will unleash the entire payload of advanced long-range torpedoes currently locked onto your location.
You have two minutes to confirm your compliance.
Refusal to do so will result in your obliteration.
If you test me, you will fail.
Mr. Sulu, remind me never to piss you off.
We will arrive at Harrison's location in three minutes, Captain.
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.
I calculate the odds of him attempting to kill us at 91.6%.
Fantastic.
Good thing you don't care about dying.
I am sorry, Lieutenant. I could not hear what you said.
I didn't say anything.
Actually, I'd be happy to speak
-if you're willing to listen to me.
-Guys...
Lieutenant, I would prefer to discuss this in private.
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.
Our current circumstances...
Are you really gonna do this right now?
What never seems to require your undivided focus...
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.
-Okay.
-...is us.
At that volcano, you didn't give a thought to us.
What it would do to me if you died, Spock.
You didn't feel anything.
You didn't care.
And I'm not the only one who's upset with you. The Captain is, too.
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.
She is right.
Your suggestion that I do not care about dying is incorrect.
A sentient being's optimal chance at maximizing their utility is a long and prosperous life.
Great.
Not exactly a love song, Spock.
You misunderstand.
It is true I chose not to feel anything upon realizing that my own life was ending.
As Admiral Pike was dying, I joined with his consciousness and experienced what he felt at the moment of his passing.
Anger.
Confusion.
Loneliness.
Fear.
I had experienced those feelings before, multiplied exponentially on the day my planet was destroyed.
Such a feeling is something I choose never to experience again.
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel as a reflection of my not caring.
Well, I assure you, the truth is precisely the opposite.
What the hell was that?
What happened?
Where's their signal?
It cut out.
I'm working to get them back.
We are being pursued by a D-4 class Klingon vessel.
I thought this sector was abandoned!
It must be a random patrol.
Hold on!
This ship has no offensive capabilities.
It's got us.
Give me all six fuel cells.
Aye, Captain.
Damn it!
They're closing fast, bearing 285!
All right, there!
There! We can lose them there.
If you are suggesting that we utilize the passage between the approaching structures,
-this ship will not fit.
-We'll fit.
-Captain, we will not fit.
-We'll fit, we'll fit!
-I told you we'd fit.
-I am not sure that qualifies.
Any sign of them?
-No.
Which worries me.
-We lost them!
Or they're jamming our scanners.
Or we lost them.
They're ordering us to land.
Captain, they're gonna want to know why we're here.
And they're gonna torture us.
Question us.
And they're gonna kill us.
So we come out shooting.
We're outnumbered, outgunned.
There's no way we survive if we attack first.
You brought me here because I speak Klingon.
Then let me speak Klingon.
This isn't going to work.
It is our only logical option.
And if you interrupt her now, you will not only incur the wrath of the Klingons but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.
I AM HERE TO HELP YOU.
-Lieutenant.
-Thanks, Captain.
WITH RESPECT.
THERE IS A CRIMINAL HIDING IN THESE RUINS
HE HAS KILLED MANY OF OUR PEOPLE.
WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT A HUMAN KILLING HUMANS?
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT HONOR.
AND THIS MAN HAS NONE.
YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER.
-Stand down.
-How many torpedoes?
Stand down!
The torpedoes, the weapons you threatened me with in your message. How many are there?
Seventy-two.
I surrender.
On behalf of Christopher Pike, my friend, I accept your surrender.
Captain!
Captain.
Cuff him.
-Bones, meet me in the brig.
-Be right there.
Lieutenant.
Contact Starfleet, let them know we have Harrison in custody, and we'll be on our way once the warp core is repaired.
Yes, sir.
-Why the hell did he surrender?
-I don't know.
But he just took out a squad of Klingons single-handedly.
I want to know how.
Sounds like we have a superman on board.
You tell me.
Put your arm through the hole. I'm gonna take a blood sample.
Why aren't we moving, Captain?
An unexpected malfunction, perhaps in your warp core conveniently stranding you on the edge of Klingon space?
-How the hell do you know that?
-Bones.
I think you'd find my insight valuable, Captain.
-We good?
-Yeah.
Let me know what you find.
Ignore me and you will get everyone on this ship killed.
Captain, I believe he will only attempt to manipulate you.
I would not recommend engaging the prisoner further.
Give me a minute.
Let me explain what's happening here.
You are a criminal.
I watched you murder innocent men and women.
I was authorized to end you!
And the only reason why you are still alive is because I am allowing it.
So shut your mouth.
Oh, Captain, are you going to punch me again over and over till your arm weakens?
Clearly you want to, so tell me, why did you allow me to live?
We all make mistakes.
No. I surrendered to you because, despite your attempt to convince me otherwise, you seem to have a conscience, Mr. Kirk.
If you did not, then it would be impossible for me to convince you of the truth.
23-17-46-11.
Coordinates not far from Earth.
If you want to know why I did what I did, go and take a look.
Give me one reason why I should listen to you.
I can give you 72.
And they're on board your ship, Captain.
They have been all along.
I suggest you open one up.
Hi!
You know what really bothers me, though?
It's the modifications, you know, the enhancements.
Right? And then like that, I'm off the ship!
Just for trying to do what's right!
And what did you do anyway?
You just stood there like an oyster, looking at me!
What?
Scotty, it's Kirk.
Well now!
If it isn't Captain James Tiberius Perfect Hair!
Did you hear that? I called him Perfect Hair.
-Where are you?
-Where are you?
Are you drunk?
What I do in my private time is my business, Jimbo.
I need you to help me out with something.
Will you take these coordinates down?
23-17-46-11.
Are you writing?
What, you don't think I can remember four numbers?
Ye of little faith.
What was the third one?
Forty-six.
I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but I have a feeling you'll know it when you see it.
You may have been right about those torpedoes.
I will consider that an apology.
And I will consider that apology.
You are the one who quit.
You made me quit!
Mr. Scott?
Scott.
The nerve of that guy!
I am not doing that man any favors!
No!
All right, then!
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?
You're not actually going to listen to this guy?
He killed Pike, he almost killed you, and now you think it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo because he dared you to.
Why did he save our lives, Bones?
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.
Don't agree with me, Spock.
It makes me very uncomfortable.
Perhaps you, too, should learn to govern your emotions, Doctor.
In this situation, logic dictates...
Logic?
Oh, my God!
There's a maniac trying to make us blow up our own damn ship and...
I don't know why he surrendered, but that's not it.
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo. The question is how.
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board, who exactly is qualified to just pop open a four-ton stick of dynamite?
The Admiral's daughter appeared to have interest in the torpedoes and she is a weapons specialist.
Perhaps she could be of some use.
What Admiral's daughter?
Carol Marcus.
Your new science officer concealed her identity to board the ship.
When were you going to tell me that?
When it became relevant.
As it just did.
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?
That's why I forged my transfer onto your ship to find out why.
I do apologize for that.
By the way, if I caused you any problems, I am sorry.
I'm Carol Marcus.
-James Kirk.
-Torpedoes.
My father gave me access to every program he oversaw, then I heard he was developing these prototype torpedoes.
When I went to confront him about it, he wouldn't even see me.
That's when I discovered the torpedoes had disappeared from all official records.
And then he gave them to me.
You're much cleverer than your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.
I have a reputation?
Yes, you do.
I'm a friend of Christine Chapel's.
Christine, yes.
How is she?
She transferred to the outer frontier to be a nurse.
She's much happier now.
That's good.
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
What are we doing in here?
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?
Of course it is.
-Would you please turn around?
-Why?
Just turn around.
It's too dangerous to try and open one of these torpedoes on the Enterprise.
But there is a nearby planetoid.
I can open one up there.
But I will need some help.
Turn around.
Now!
Captain on the bridge!
Mr. Sulu, have Doctors Marcus and McCoy landed on the planetoid yet?
Yes, sir. They're moving the torpedo into position now.
Good.
Any activity from the Klingons?
Not yet.
But if we're stuck here much longer, they will find us.
Lieutenant Uhura, did you let Starfleet know we have Harrison in custody?
Yes, sir.
No response yet.
Engineering to bridge.
Hello.
Captain, can you hear me?
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.
We found the leak, sir, but the damage is substantial.
We're working on it.
Any idea what caused it?
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.
Something tells me it wasn't your fault.
Stay on it.
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.
Bones, thanks for helping out.
Dr. Marcus asked for the steadiest hands on the ship.
You know, when I dreamt about being stuck on a deserted planet with a gorgeous woman, there was no torpedo!
Dr. McCoy, may I remind you, you are not there to flirt.
So how can these legendary hands help you, Dr. Marcus?
Bones!
To understand how powerful these weapons are, we need to open the warhead. To do that, we need to access the fuel compartment.
Unfortunately for us, the warheads on these weapons are live.
Sweetheart, I once performed an emergency C-section on a pregnant Gorn.
Octuplets.
And let me tell you, those little bastards bite.
I think I can work some magic on your missile.
Dr. McCoy, there's a bundle of fiber optic cables against the inner casing.
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.
Whatever you do, do not touch anything else.
Do you understand?
Right. The thought never crossed my mind.
Dr. McCoy, wait for my word.
I'm rerouting the detonation processor.
-Are you ready?
-And raring.
Good luck.
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.
The warhead's gonna detonate in 30 seconds, sir!
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!
Target their signal.
Beam them back right now.
The transporter cannot differentiate between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.
We cannot beam back one without the other.
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?
I'm trying. I'm trying.
Jim, get her the hell out of here!
No!
If you beam me back, he dies!
Just let me do it!
Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Standing by to transport Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.
Four.
Three.
Shit!
Deactivation successful, Captain.
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?
Bones!
Jim?
You're going to want to see this.
COORDINATES 23.17.46.11 JUPITER
Delta team, deliver your thrusters to loading dock 12.
U.S.S. Vengeance, bridge crew requesting entry to construction hangar.
You are cleared to enter the hangar.
I need a welding team on the number one nacelle.
Holy...
What have we got?
It's quite clever actually.
This fuel container's been removed from the torpedo and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.
-Is he alive?
-He's alive.
But if we try to revive him without the proper sequencing, it could kill him.
This technology's beyond me.
How advanced, Doctor?
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.
We haven't needed to freeze anyone since we developed warp capability, which explains the most interesting thing about our friend here.
He's 300 years old.
Why is there a man in that torpedo?
There are men and women in all those torpedoes, Captain.
I put them there.
Who the hell are you?
A remnant of a time long past.
Genetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war.
But we were condemned as criminals, forced into exile.
For centuries we slept, hoping when we awoke, things would be different.
But as a result of the destruction of Vulcan, your Starfleet began to aggressively search distant quadrants of space.
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.
I looked up "John Harrison."
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.
John Harrison was a fiction created the moment I was awoken by your Admiral Marcus to help him advance his cause.
A smokescreen to conceal my true identity.
My name is
Khan.
Why would a Starfleet Admiral ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?
Because I am better.
-At what?
-Everything.
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to an uncivilized threat in a civilized time and for that he needed a warrior's mind.
My mind.
To design weapons and warships.
You are suggesting the Admiral violated every regulation he vowed to uphold simply because he wanted to exploit your intellect.
He wanted to exploit my savagery.
Intellect alone is useless in a fight, Mr. Spock.
You... You can't even break a rule.
How would you be expected to break bone?
Marcus used me to design weapons.
To help him realize his vision of a militarized Starfleet.
He sent you to use those weapons.
To fire my torpedoes on an unsuspecting planet.
And then he purposely crippled your ship in enemy space, leading to one inevitable outcome.
The Klingons would come searching for whomever was responsible, and you would have no chance of escape.
Marcus would finally have the war he talked about.
The war he always wanted.
No.
No.
I watched you open fire in a room full of unarmed Starfleet officers.
You killed them in cold blood!
Marcus took my crew from me.
You are a murderer!
He used my friends to control me.
I tried to smuggle them to safety by concealing them in the very weapons
I had designed, but I was discovered.
I had no choice but to escape alone.
And when I did, I had every reason to suspect that Marcus had killed every single one of the people I hold most dear.
So I responded in kind.
My crew is my family, Kirk.
Is there anything you would not do for your family?
Proximity alert, sir!
There's a ship at warp heading right for us.
-Klingons?
-At warp?
No, Kirk.
-We both know who it is.
-I don't think so.
It's not coming at us from Kronos.
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.
Post six security officers on him.
Yes, Captain.
Captain on the bridge!
ETA of the incoming ship.
Three seconds, sir.
-Shields.
-Aye, Captain.
They're hailing us, sir.
On screen.
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.
Captain Kirk.
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.
That's a hell of a ship you got there.
And I wasn't expecting to get word that you'd taken Harrison into custody in violation of your orders.
Well, we...
We had to improvise when our warp core unexpectedly malfunctioned.
But you already knew that, didn't you, sir?
I don't take your meaning.
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?
To assist with our repairs?
Why else would the head of Starfleet personally come to the edge of the Neutral Zone?
Captain, they're scanning our ship.
Is there something I can help you find, sir?
Where is your prisoner, Kirk?
Per Starfleet regulation, I'm planning on returning Khan to Earth to stand trial.
Well, shit.
You talked to him.
This is exactly what I was hoping to spare you from.
I took a tactical risk and I woke that bastard up, believing that his superior intelligence could help us protect ourselves from whatever came at us next.
But I made a mistake.
And now the blood of everybody he's killed is on my hands.
So I'm asking you, give him to me so that I can end what I started.
And what exactly would you like me to do with the rest of his crew, sir?
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?
Start a war in the process?
He put those people in those torpedoes.
And I simply didn't want to burden you with knowing what was inside of them.
You saw what this man can do all by himself.
Can you imagine what would happen if we woke up the rest of his crew?
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?
He's playing you, son, don't you see that?
Khan and his crew were condemned to death as war criminals.
And now it is our duty to carry out that sentence before anybody else dies because of him.
Now, I'm going to ask you again!
One last time, son.
Lower your shields.
Tell me where he is.
He's in engineering, sir.
But I'll have him moved to the transporter room right away.
I'll take it from here.
Do not drop those shields,
-Mr. Sulu.
-Aye, Captain.
Captain, given your awareness of Khan's true location in the med bay, may I know the details of your plan?
I told Marcus we were bringing a fugitive back to Earth.
That's what we're going to do.
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?
Sir, if we go to warp, we run the risk of seriously damaging the core!
Can we do it?
Technically, yes, but I would not advise it, Captain.
Noted.
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.
Yes, sir.
Punch it.
Well, at least we're moving again.
If you think you're safe at warp, you're wrong.
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet. Tell them we were pursued into the Neutral Zone by an unmarked Federation ship.
Comms are down, sir.
Permission to come on the bridge.
Dr. Marcus.
He's gonna catch up with us, and when he does, the only thing that's gonna stop him destroying this ship is me, so you have to let me talk to him.
Carol, we're at warp. He can't catch up with us.
Yes, he can. He's been developing a ship that has advanced warp capabilities...
Captain!
I'm getting a reading I don't understand.
Where are we?
We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.
-Damage report!
-Weapons are way down.
-Shields are dropping.
-We're defenseless, sir.
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.
-Where's the damage?
-Major hull damage, Captain.
Evasive maneuvers!
Get us to Earth! Right now!
Captain! Stop!
Everybody on this ship is going to die if you don't let me speak to him.
Uhura, hail him.
Sir. It's me.
It's Carol.
What are you doing on that ship?
I heard what you said.
That you made a mistake and now you're doing everything you can to fix it.
But, Dad,
I don't believe that the man who raised me is capable of destroying a ship full of innocent people.
And, if I'm wrong about that, then you're gonna have to do it with me on board.
Actually, Carol, I won't.
-Jim...
-Can we intercept the transport signal?
No, sir.
Carol!
Captain Kirk, without authorization and in league with the fugitive John Harrison, you went rogue in enemy territory, leaving me no choice but to hunt you down and destroy you.
-Lock phasers.
-Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!
I'll make this quick.
Target all aft torpedoes on the Enterprise bridge.
Sir, my crew was just following my orders.
I take full responsibility for my actions. But they were mine and they were mine alone.
If I transmit Khan's location to you now, all that I ask is that you spare them.
Please, sir.
I'll do anything you want.
Just let them live.
That's a hell of an apology.
But if it's any consolation, I was never going to spare your crew.
Fire when...
I'm sorry.
Our weapons won't fire, sir!
Our shields are down! We're losing power!
Someone in engineering just manually reset our systems!
What do you mean, "someone"?
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.
Enterprise! Can you hear me?
Scotty!
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.
-You're on that ship!
-I snuck on.
And seeing as I've just committed an act of treason against a Starfleet Admiral, I'd really like to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!
You're a miracle worker.
We're a little low on power right now.
Just stand by.
Stand by.
What do you mean, "low on power"?
What happened to the Enterprise?
Call you back.
Scotty!
Spock.
Our ship, how is she?
Our options are limited, Captain.
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.
There is one option.
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,
-patch him through.
-Yes, sir.
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.
Captain, I strongly object.
To what?
I haven't said anything yet.
Since we cannot take the ship from the outside, the only way we can take it is from within.
And as a large boarding party would be detected, it is optimal for you to take as few members of the crew as possible.
You will meet resistance, requiring personnel with advanced combat abilities and innate knowledge of that ship.
This indicates that you plan to align with Khan, the very man we were sent here to destroy.
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
An Arabic proverb attributed to a prince who was betrayed and decapitated by his own subjects.
Still, it's a hell of a quote.
-I will go with you, Captain.
-No, I need you on the bridge.
I cannot allow you to do this.
It is my function aboard this ship to advise you on making the wisest decisions possible, something I firmly believe you are incapable of doing in this moment.
You're right!
What I'm about to do, it doesn't make any sense, it's not logical.
It is a gut feeling.
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
I only know what I can do.
The Enterprise and her crew need someone in that chair that knows what he's doing.
And it's not me.
It's you, Spock.
Tell me everything you know about that ship.
Dreadnought class.
Two times the size, three times the speed.
Advanced weaponry. Modified for a minimal crew.
Unlike most Federation vessels, it's built solely for combat.
I will do everything I can to make you answer for what you did.
But right now I need your help.
In exchange for what?
You said you'd do anything for your crew.
-I can guarantee their safety.
-Captain.
You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.
Bones, what are you doing with that tribble?
The tribble's dead.
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.
Khan's cells regenerate like nothing I've ever seen, and I want to know why.
You coming with me or not?
You want to do what?
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering the Enterprise into position as we speak.
To this ship?
How?
There's a cargo door, hangar 7, access port 101A.
You need to find the manual override to open that airlock.
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.
It is not gonna be all right.
You want me to open an airlock into space, whereupon I will freeze, die and explode!
Lieutenant, from our current position, is it possible to establish contact with New Vulcan?
-I'll do my best.
-Thank you.
Mr. Sulu, what is the status of the other ship?
Their systems are still offline.
I'm aligning our ship now.
Scotty, how we doing over there?
Captain, I wish I had better news.
They've locked out access to the ship's computer.
They'll have full weapons in three minutes.
That means next time I won't be able to stop them destroying the Enterprise. Stand by.
Commander, our trash exhaust is aimed at access port 101A of the other ship.
Captain, the ships are aligned.
Copy that.
-Scotty!
-I'm in the hangar.
Give me a minute.
I'm running.
Stand by.
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.
It's four square meters, tops.
It's gonna be like jumping out of a moving car, off a bridge, into your shot glass.
It's okay.
I've done it before.
Yeah, it was vertical.
We jumped onto a...
It was a...
It doesn't matter.
Scotty...
Did you find the manual override?
The manual override, Scotty.
Not yet, not yet.
Captain, before you launch, you should be aware there is a considerable debris field between our ships.
-Spock, not now.
Scotty, you good?
-It's not easy!
Just give me two seconds, all right, you mad bastard!
Tell me this is gonna work.
I have neither the information nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.
Okay, Captain, stand by.
Boy, you're a real comfort.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
Okay, okay!
I'm set to open the door.
You ready?
Are you?
Spock, pull the trigger.
Yes, Captain.
Launching activation sequence on three, two, one.
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at .432!
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.
Copy that.
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!
I know, I know!
I can see that.
Don't move.
Use your display compass, Captain.
You must correct precisely
-37.243 degrees.
-Got it.
I'm working my way back.
Scotty, you're gonna be ready with that door, right?
What are you doing in here?
Wee bit of maintenance on the airlock console.
You're big.
Mr. Scott, where are you?
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.
I'm working on getting his signal back.
Stand by.
-Damn it.
-Captain, what is it?
My helmet was hit.
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.
Not yet.
I'm still working on a signal.
His communicator is working.
-I don't know why he isn't responding.
-What is that?
Are you Starfleet or private security?
Show me your other hand.
Because you look like private security.
Imminent collision detected!
Khan, use evasive action!
-There is debris directly ahead.
-I see it.
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?
I don't know, Commander. I'm having trouble tracking him in all this debris.
Was Khan hit?
We are trying to find him now.
Captain, you need to adjust your target destination to 183 by 473 degrees.
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.
Captain, without your display compass, hitting your target destination is mathematically impossible.
Spock, if I get back, we really need to talk about your bedside manner.
Commander, he's not going to make it.
My display is still functioning.
I see you, Kirk, you're 200 meters ahead of me at my one o'clock.
Come to your left a few degrees and follow me.
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.
Do you copy? Do you copy?
Scotty?
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,
-open the door in ten, nine...
-Scotty!
That person counting down,
-what is that?
-...eight...
I think you're hearing things, mate.
-...seven...
-Mr. Scott, where are you?
-...six, five...
-1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.
-Scotty, where are you?
-...three...
-Do you copy, Scotty?
Please!
-...two...
-Sorry about this.
-About what?
-Mr.
Scott, open the door! -Open the door!
Mr. Scott, now!
Welcome aboard.
-It's good to see you, Scotty.
-Who is that?
Khan, Scotty.
Scotty, Khan.
Hello.
They'll know we're here.
I know the best way to the bridge.
It's locked to stun.
Theirs won't be.
Try not to get shot.
Commander, I have that transmission as requested.
On screen, please.
Stand by.
Mr. Spock.
Mr. Spock.
Admiral.
I'll deal with you in a...
I am ashamed to be your daughter.
Sir, we just had a hangar door open on deck 13.
Khan.
They're going to have full power and we're walking?
The turbolifts are easily tracked and Marcus would have us in a cage.
This path runs adjacent to the engine room.
They know they won't be able to use their weapons here without destabilizing the warp core, which gives us the advantage.
-Where'd you find this guy?
-It's a long story.
I will be brief.
In your travels, did you ever encounter a man named Khan?
As you know,
I have made a vow never to give you information that could potentially alter your destiny.
Your path is yours to walk, and yours alone.
That being said,
Khan Noonien Singh is the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise ever faced.
He is brilliant, ruthless, and he will not hesitate to kill every single one of you.
Did you defeat him?
At great cost. Yes.
How?
I don't mean to tempt fate here, but where is everybody?
The ship is designed to be flown by minimal crew, one, if necessary.
One?
I...
-You all right?
-Yeah. Where's Khan?
Lieutenant, I need you to assemble all senior medical and engineering staff in the weapons bay.
All right.
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently activated a torpedo.
Could you replicate the process?
Why the hell would I want to do that?
Can you or can you not?
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician!
The fact that you are a doctor is precisely why I need you to listen very carefully.
Where is he?
Shit!
This way.
The minute we get to the bridge, drop him.
What, stun him?
Khan?
I thought he was helping us.
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.
Power coming online, sir!
-Retarget the Enterprise now.
-Aye, sir.
Make sure he stays down.
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.
You're not actually going to do this, are you?
Admiral, get out of the chair.
You better stop and think about what you're doing, Kirk.
You better think about what you did on Kronos.
You made an incursion onto an enemy planet!
You killed a Klingon patrol.
Even if you got away without a trace, war is coming.
And who is going to lead us?
You?
If I'm not in charge, our entire way of life is decimated!
So you want me off this ship, you better kill me.
I'm not going to kill you, sir.
But I could stun your ass and drag you out of that chair.
I'd rather not do that in front of your daughter.
-You all right?
-Yes, Captain.
Jim!
Listen!
Wait!
You...
You should have let me sleep.
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.
I'm going to make this very simple for you.
-Captain.
-Your crew for my crew.
You betrayed us.
You are smart, Mr. Spock.
Spock don't...
Mr. Spock, give me my crew.
And what will you do when you get them?
Continue the work we were doing before we were banished.
Which, as I understand it, involves the mass genocide of any being you find to be less than superior.
Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?
Or will you give me what I want?
We have no transporter capabilities.
Fortunately mine are perfectly functional.
Drop your shields.
If I do so, I have no guarantee that you will not destroy the Enterprise.
Well, let's play this out logically then, Mr. Spock.
Firstly, I will kill your Captain to demonstrate my resolve.
Then if yours holds, I will have no choice but to kill you and your entire crew.
If you destroy our ship, you will also destroy your own people.
Your crew requires oxygen to survive, mine does not.
I will target your life support systems located behind the aft nacelle.
And after every single person aboard your ship suffocates, I will walk over your cold corpses to recover my people.
Now, shall we begin?
Lower shields.
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.
I see your 72 torpedoes are still in their tubes.
If they are not mine, Commander, I will know it.
Vulcans do not lie.
The torpedoes are yours.
Thank you, Mr. Spock.
I have fulfilled your terms.
Now fulfill mine.
Well, Kirk, it seems apt to return you to your crew.
After all, no ship should go down without her captain.
He's locking phasers on us, sir!
Let us out of here now!
Shields at 6%!
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?
Twelve seconds, sir!
Crew of the Enterprise, prepare for imminent proximity detonation.
What's he talking about?
What detonation?
The torpedoes.
He armed the damn torpedoes!
No!
Sir, their weapons have been knocked out.
-Not bad, Commander.
-Thank you, Lieutenant.
-Bones!
-Bones!
-Nurse!
-I got you. I got you.
Dr. Marcus.
Good to see you, Jim.
You helped Spock detonate those torpedoes?
Damn right I did.
He killed Khan's crew!
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.
I've got Khan's crew.
Seventy-two human popsicles safe and sound in their cryo tubes.
Son of a bitch!
Sir, the central power grid is failing!
-Switch to auxiliary power.
