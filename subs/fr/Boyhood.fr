Hey, love bug. You ready?
Yeah.
Hey, guess what, Mom?
I figured out where wasps come from.
Yeah?
Where?
Well, I think it must be, if you flick water into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp. Hey!
Yep.
That's cool.
So, how was your day at school?
Fine.
I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kind of liked her.
What'd she say?
Well, she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments.
And I told her, "I know he does them," "'cause I check them every night."
She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack.
She didn't ask for 'em.
Baby, she doesn't have to. You're just supposed to turn them in.
And she said you're still staring out the window all day.
Not all day.
And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener.
Not on purpose!
Wait! She said that you crammed a bunch of rocks in it.
I thought if we could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks.
Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks?
I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection.
Dude, my turn!
Mason!
Samantha!
Tommy! Is Mason down there?
Yeah.
Well, tell him he has to come home to dinner.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, sweetie.
Why aren't you ready?
Hey, Mason.
Hey, Ted.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go. What time is it?
It's 9:00. Let's go, let's go!
Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause Janice flaked out. I don't have a sitter.
Why didn't you call somebody else?
I can't get a babysitter now. It's 9:00.
But you're welcome to hang out with us.
Well, no!
I mean, we have plans.
The guys are expecting me.
Well, you can go.
All right. I'll come back in a couple of hours.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Yes, it's okay.
"'Turn back! Turn back!
I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle."
"'Who? said Harry, as they backtracked quickly."
"'She haunts one of the toilets" "in the girls' bathroom on the first floor, said Hermione."
"'She haunts a toilet?"
"Yes, it's been out of order all year," "'because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place!"
"'I never went in there anyway, if I could avoid it."
"'It's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you."'
Why can't you just say that?
I'm sorry.
- I don't wanna go with you.
- You're sorry, that's bullshit! That's right. I wanna stay here with my kids.
That's what I'd rather do.
Would you stop using your kids as an excuse?
I know you have to stay here with your kids!
You're acting...
You have this immature life.
You have no responsibility!
I have an immature life!
I have responsibility. I have an immature life.
You don't know what it's like to be a parent.
No, I don't!
And why am I responsible for your mistakes in life?
Don't call my kids mistakes!
Don't! I didn't call your kids...
You said, "Your mistakes in your life," pointing at my kids.
I know what I said, you know. And immediately you use your kids again.
This is the reality.
I'm a parent!
- That means responsibility. - I know you're a parent.
I would love to have some time to myself!
I would love to just go to a fuckin' movie!
You don't think I'd like that?
Go have some dinner, go to a bar!
I don't even know what that's like!
I was someone's daughter, then I was somebody's fuckin' mother!
Okay? I don't know what that's like!
Stop!
Quit it!
Quit it!
Mom!
What the hell is going on in here?
Do you guys know what time it is?
He's throwing things at me.
Mason!
Do not throw things at your sister!
She's faking, she hit me first!
Listen, both of you!
I'm going back to bed. I don't wanna hear another peep out of here for an hour.
Go to sleep.
- Faker!
- Guys!
Look what I found in the street.
Dude!
I know, right?
Look at those.
Look at those!
So listen, guys, I wanna talk to you about something. And you might not like this idea at first, but we're moving to Houston.
When?
Well, soon. We should be out by the first, so we don't have to pay two rents next month.
No, Mother, we're not moving.
Nope, nope.
Sorry, Mom. Nope. Nope.
Samantha, I have to go back to college, so I can make us a better living.
With this job, I can't take care of us the way I'd like to.
I can't keep going this way.
And Grandma said she'd help us out, and it would be nice to be near her.
Fine, Mother. You can do whatever you want, but we're not moving.
And what about our friends?
Baby, we can email them or write. We can come back to visit.
And guess what?
This place that Grandma found us, you'll each have your own room.
Right?
And there's a pool.
Mom, do you still love Dad?
I still love your father, but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together.
What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't?
That won't be a problem.
He can call Grandma and she'll tell him, or he can call Information.
We won't be hard to find.
Is he still in Alaska?
Well, that's what your uncle says.
Probably taming polar bears or something.
Yeah. Well, I hope they're taming him.
Here, wanna help me out?
Sure.
Okay.
Take this paint very carefully and paint any little smudge or mark or anything on the baseboard there, behind the door and all around the doorways on the inside.
She says we're gonna come visit and I'm gonna write and call you.
Wait, hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.
Hello?
Sorry, Tommy. Mason can't come over today. We're moving.
And I'm on the other line. Bye.
Althea?
I'm gonna be sending Sailor Scout instructions.
Email and write back telling me how the other scouts are doing.
Well, because you're the leader now.
Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get there before it gets dark.
Goodbye, yard.
Goodbye, crape myrtle. Goodbye, mailbox.
Goodbye, box of stuff Mommy won't let us take with us, but we don't wanna throw away.
Goodbye, house.
I'll never like Mommy as much for making us move!
Samantha!
Why don't you say goodbye to that little horseshit attitude, okay?
'Cause we're not taking that in the car.
Goodbye, old lady who listens to rock music and rides a motorcycle.
What's happening back there?
Stop, put the barrier up.
Hey! Put the pillow between you. Make a barrier, come on.
We're gonna play a game called The Game of Silence.
Whoever can stay quiet for the longest period of time wins.
You guys think you can do that?
Okay, go.
The bus will be here in 10 minutes.
Put that homework in your backpack.
Go eat!
Baby, go eat.
I am!
Speak English!
Shut up!
Mom! She's speaking that stupid language again!
Samantha!
I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother.
He's a little slow in the head.
He did officially flunk first grade.
Sit your butt down!
Yes, sir, Mother, sir!
All right, listen up, guys.
Grandma's gonna pick you up after school.
Your dad's in town for the day.
So you're gonna spend the afternoon with him.
Is he moving back?
I don't know.
We haven't seen him in about 80 years.
Like a year and a half.
Please.
Can we please eat here?
The bus is coming.
Who wants syrup?
All right, nice cursive.
Okay, Mason, when I check the mobiles, am I gonna find yours?
No.
And why not?
'Cause I didn't finish it.
Well, it's time to finish it.
Just a minute.
No, let's do... Apple Quit.
Time to finish your work, Mason.
"Apple Quit."
So this is my history test.
"A+", very good.
And that's another history test.
And another
Yeah, it doesn't have a plus, but, well.
And then, um, that's my report on lizards.
Let me see your pictures.
Yeah. These are my pictures.
What is that?
Well, that's called a dewlap.
A dewlap, okay.
Yeah, this is a math test.
"A" again.
Mase, that's the last candy, okay?
Okay.
We need to put this stuff up.
That's him.
Daddy!
My God! Look at you, you're so big!
Hey, MJ.
What's happenin', buddy?
You guys ready to have some fun?
Yeah!
Yeah!
All right.
Hey, Catherine, how are you?
Mase, I'm good.
Good to see you. Yeah.
What time should I have these rascals back?
I don't know, around 7:30, I guess.
I gotta get them home by 8:00.
You know what, why don't I take 'em over to their mom's?
No, that's okay. She's expecting me.
No, that's all right.
You guys know where it is, don't you?
Yeah. All right. I'll do it.
It's no problem. I don't think that's such a good idea.
Look, it's no problem. All right?
You guys ready to go?
Let's do it, go!
Go? Wait a minute.
You gotta get your stuff.
You got backpack, your purse, homework, go to the bathroom.
Can't believe how big they are.
Yeah. Time's going by.
Must be nice for you, having 'em here in Houston.
I love it, yeah. I'm volunteering at their school.
Yeah?
What you doing over there?
I'm in the library. You know, reading to the little ones.
Great.
So, Alaska?
Yeah.
Are you back?
We'll see.
How's Liv?
She's a busy girl.
She's back in school.
But she's working and single parenting.
A lot to juggle.
- You guys got everything? - Yeah.
All right, say goodbye to your grandmother.
Bye, Grandma.
All right, let's roll.
No, wait a second.
You're not the type of kids who like presents, are you?
Yes!
No, you don't.
Of course we do.
Presents? Really?
Let's do it!
Yay!
I call front seat! I wanted the front seat, though.
All right. Well, Mason gets it on the way there and Samantha gets it on the way back.
- Hop in there.
- Seat belts!
Seat belts. All right.
Seat belts. Don't forget your seat belts.
It's not like this car has any seat belts.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice!
Come here, come here, yes!
That was awesome!
Get up there, Mason!
Get up there! It was so good!
Come on.
Let 'em know who you are, buddy.
Let 'em know who you are.
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
All right.
All right, don't worry about it.
Wish we could use the bumpers.
Bumpers are for kids!
What are you, two years old?
You don't want the bumpers.
Life doesn't give you bumpers.
There we, there we go. There we go! We got something there!
We got something!
We got something!
Last time I went bowling, we had bumpers and it was a lot more fun!
You don't want the bumpers, all right?
You bowl a strike with the bumpers and it doesn't mean anything. Trust me.
Just lay it out on the lane.
One, two, three and...
Let's hear it for the father!
Boom!
- Get up there!
- Great shot!
Get out there, girl!
Four Blackwater operatives have been viciously attacked in their cars in Fallujah.
The bodies and cars were set on fire after insurgents started...
Look at this!
It's a disaster.
Let me tell you what's happening in Iraq, all right?
Exactly what every thinking person in the world knew was gonna happen before they got started. But Bush and his little numb-nut fanatics he's got around him, they don't give a rat's ass.
That's a quarter.
What's a quarter?
You said A-S-S.
Sorry.
My bad.
And my teacher says it's a good war, because it's better to be safe than sorry.
That's what they're teaching you in school?
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to your father, okay?
That is the lie. That's the big lie.
Iraq had nothing to do with what happened at the World Trade Center.
You know that, right?
I guess.
Who you gonna vote for next fall, MJ?
I don't know.
He can't vote. He's not 18.
All right, who would you vote for?
Kerry?
Anybody but Bush!
Okay?
Are you gonna move back?
I'm planning on it.
You know, I gotta find a job.
Are you and Mom gonna get back together?
I don't know.
That's not, entirely up to me, you know?
I remember when I was six, you and Mom were fighting like mad.
You were yelling so loud and she was crying.
That's what you remember?
Yep.
You don't remember the trips to Galveston, camping in Big Bend, all the fun we had?
Nope.
You ever get mad at your mother?
Yeah.
You ever get mad at your brother?
Yeah. Yeah. You ever yell at him?
Yeah.
Doesn't mean you don't love him, right?
Look, the same thing happens when you're grown up, all right?
You know, you get mad at people.
You know, it's not a big deal.
What'd you do in Alaska?
I worked on a boat for a while.
I tried to write some music.
Did you see any polar bears? No.
But I saw a Kodiak bear.
It was fuckin' huge!
Dad!
That's 50 cents for the F-word!
I'm sorry.
Here, take a dollar, all right?
Keep the change.
You guys are gonna be seeing a lot more of me.
Okay? I missed you two real bad while I was gone, okay, I want you to know that.
I just needed to take some time, you know, to...
Just... Your mom and me, okay...
Well, your mother, okay, is a piece of work, all right.
I think you know that by now, all right?
And I'm just... I'm so happy to be with the two of you, okay?
And I'm sorry about that bumper business.
I'm gonna get better at stuff like that, okay?
I got that one at Dripping Springs, and, um, my friend Rodney gave me that one.
- Yeah?
- And I bought that one.
You bought this one? Yeah.
You found this at Dripping Springs?
Wow.
What else do you got?
Well, um, these are snake vertebrae.
Snake vertebrae?
That's disgusting.
Mason, I don't want you collecting snake vertebrae anymore.
Is this the feather I sent you?
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.
Dad!
Um, I forgot to show you, um, these basketball pictures.
You're on a basketball team?
Check you out!
These are beaver claws. Beaver claws?
That's me.
- Yeah. No.
- What, you hunting beaver?
You see, that's McKinney, that's Meg and that's Gem. Those are my friends.
What position do you play?
Um, guard.
This is dried Canadian grass.
Wait, have you scored any points?
Well, about eight or 10 a game.
Eight or 10 a game?
That is awesome!
Once, she didn't score any and she cried!
You cried?
Well, only a little bit. Aw...
Hello!
Pomegranate.
Mason, Mom's home!
Mom's home! Mom's home.
Hi!
Look at this owl Daddy gave me!
Isn't it cool?
See, its head spins!
And look at this bracelet. It was made by Indians in Alaska.
And Daddy made this cool hand-carved grizzly bear and this tiki.
- It's a totem.
- And guess what else? We went bowling and I made four strikes!
Yeah, and we got to ride around in Dad's car!
Hey, Liv.
Hey. I know you wanted me to drop them off at your mom's. I just thought it'd be easier if I brought 'em over here.
Well, it really screwed up my plans.
Well, we just wanted to show him our rooms. Yeah.
Did you guys eat anything?
Well, we had some French fries at the bowling alley.
Did you do your homework? No.
Not yet.
Okay. Can I talk to you outside for a second?
Yeah. Sure.
They had more than French fries.
Do you think he's gonna spend the night?
Doesn't look like it.
An unconditioned stimulus, something that produces an unlearned, involuntary, unconditioned response.
Now, in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus that he used?
Come on now, people! Tough weekend?
What's the deal here?
Meat, right?
Meat. Meat powder, actually.
Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog.
Okay, he put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was?
Salivation!
All right?
Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus response pair that happens to you every day?
It's probably happening to some of you right now.
How about sex?
Sure, you know, you see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response.
You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about it.
"When they call your name," "I salivate like a Pavlov dog."
Thank you very much.
Doctor Welbrock. This is my son Mason.
Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock.
Your son.
Now see, I thought this was a boy genius who was taking my college course.
He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me.
No fever. It's a con job.
I can tell because I have a nine-year-old son, he pulls this all the time. Same kind of deal.
Hey, you play soccer?
No. Neither does my boy. He hates soccer.
He likes computers.
My 11-year-old daughter loves soccer!
Who can figure?
Maybe we can get all you guys together sometime?
Maybe, yeah.
Well, you ready to go?
Yeah. Nice to meet you, Mason.
Nice to meet you, too.
And thanks for coming to my class.
Olivia.
Nice kid.
Thanks.
So, you think, Grandma might be available for a little babysitting?
Maybe.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, great.
Dead man, dead man, wake up! One, two, three, four, five, you're alive!
My turn. Kids, they're here!
- They're home, they're home!
- Come on!
Hurry, hurry.
Hi! We're here! How was it?
How was it?
Hey! We've returned!
Honey, it's so good to see you.
Hi, Dad!
Samantha, Mason.
Hello.
Thank you. That's very nice.
Hey, Mom. How are you?
Mom, Mom!
They give you trouble? Look at the sign we made.
- Samantha and I made it all ourselves.
I know the boys helped you with that a lot.
No, not at all!
- That's good.
Look at this. - Okay. There you go.
Pass out the goodies. This is for the girls.
Don't worry, we got you some absinthe.
It's in the... Let's pour.
You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off.
- And what happened?
- It flew!
It flew away, it went for miles. Went under the Arc de Triomphe, you know.
Did you guys kiss under the Bridge of Sighs?
Yes. Yes, we did.
Mom, can we see your wedding ring?
Sure.
Technically, that's a fancy step out surrounded by miniature brilliant.
I wish we could've gone to Europe.
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll go as a family next time.
But you didn't miss much, really. We just stayed in the hotel room the whole time playing video games.
Really?
And the hotels are really small and really old.
Squeaky.
Can I get you anything else? Would you like to see a dessert menu?
Listen, I told you to put that away.
Would you put that in your purse, please?
Computer games at the table.
Yes, please, another bottle of wine.
- Um, Coke.
- Um, you know what?
Mason, you're okay with water.
No more Cokes.
Thank you. And how about you? Did you finish your science project?
Not quite yet.
Well, did you work on it? Did you build anything or plan anything or...
A little.
Did he work on it at all, Mindy?
No.
Did he sit around playing video games with Mason the whole time?
Yeah.
You were supposed to finish that by the time I got back.
Remember?
Grievous is the best, man.
Yoda!
No, Yoda is, man! Yoda!
Yoda, man.
He has four arms.
Yoda, represent!
I hate Miss Burnsby. Everybody's been saying she's lesbian. She is.
She hit on Stacey.
Man, that's gross.
Think it's true?
She's always walking in the locker room.
I think I still have a couple of those...
Hey, Paul, tell us a joke.
Damn. Fuck. Go to hell.
Blew you up.
Heck, man. That was not fair.
No, actually it was.
That's, like, the fairest thing ever.
Where are you?
Once again, I take you down.
The Mask?
Three Musketeers?
First word.
- Chicken.
- Chicken. Bird.
Second word. Hood.
Big hair.
Robin Hood!
- Whoo!
- Brilliant child!
Second word.
Blanket? Hey, you can't use props!
Hey, hey, hey!
Cut it out. Judges speak. No props.
Can't use props. You can do it without that.
Think, think, think.
- Um, folding. - Bunch!
The Gathered?
Folded. Is it like...
Um...
It's just messing around with a blanket.
Wrinkling it... A Wrinkle In Time! Wrinkle.
Whoo!
What are the guards of Azkaban?
Dementors.
Front of the fine, are you ready?
Countdown with me, ladies and gentlemen.
Ten! Nine! Eight!
Four! Three! Two!
Thank you.
Thanks.
All righty. Here we go.
No, no, no.
Back up and take a practice swing first, remember?
Nice and easy. Sweep the floor. Sweep the floor.
That's good.
Don't swing too hard, Randy.
He always swings too hard.
Hey! All right!
Very good!
Back your feet up a little bit.
Yeah, like that.
Now you're gonna hit it straighter.
Okay. All right, go up and hit it. That's good.
Nice slow swing is gonna be better for you.
All right!
I don't know, man, you must've been...
See, your feet are too open, Randy.
Nice and natural.
Yes!
Go!
All right!
Give me five!
Good putt, son, good putt.
Did you see that, Randy?
That's the way to do it!
All right.
Birdie putt.
God damn it.
Son of a bitch.
Get my clubs, would you? Get the ball.
This is just in case we have guests this weekend.
He always says that, but we never have guests.
Samantha, I think I heard your dad pull up.
All right.
You guys finish your chores?
Not quite.
Just about.
How about the dusting, Sam?
I haven't done that yet.
Well, I saw you working on your art project.
You had time to finish your little art project, but you didn't have time to finish your chores?
I thought we talked about that.
Dad, it's fine, I can finish the dusting. No, it's not fine, Mindy.
You have your own chores to do and Sam has hers to do.
It's simple.
Poor choice there, Sam.
And hurry up.
Mason!
Your dad's here.
You guys aren't setting any speed records, are you?
What'd you do, get about half done? Hey, hey, hey.
So, did you finish?
No.
Is the job complete?
So, what are you gonna be doing tomorrow?
Same thing, right?
Yeah.
Okay. Go.
Bye, Mom.
Bye, babe, I love you.
Bye, Mama.
Bye, honey.
Have fun with your dad.
Just a minute, Mason.
The boys didn't finish raking leaves. Samantha did not finish dusting.
So tomorrow, when they come home, instead of swimming and all the other little stuff that they want to do, they're going to do their chores.
Right.
Okay, guys, you had this conversation, you understand? Tomorrow?
Okay.
Thank you. I just wanted you to back me up on that so I'm not the only one yelling at them all the time.
Okay, I back you up.
You guys got that?
We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
Tomorrow, chores?
They don't hear it. Goes in one ear and out the other.
But, Dad, I mean, dusting is pointless.
It's not pointless, you just don't like to do it.
But, I mean, who dusts anymore?
You do when we ask you to! And don't...
Olivia, don't let her back talk me in front of the other kids, please.
Thank you.
Samantha, please.
Whatever!
Bye-bye. Have a wonderful weekend. Sam...
Okay. Bye, guys. Love you.
I'm sorry, but I thought we talked about it.
You have to draw a line, you have to back it up.
Okay. It's just you have so many lines, Bill.
Everything's a line.
Hey, Randy! Hey.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, you two.
How you doing?
Shotgun.
Here, let me get these bags here.
You doing okay, darling?
Yeah.
Yeah? What about you, cowboy?
Pretty good.
Yeah?
All right.
Let's roll!
You guys ready for the big game?
Yeah.
Sam, who are the Astros playing tonight?
I don't know.
The Milwaukee Brewers, all right?
Get to know 'em, get to hate 'em.
Mason. How you been? How was your week?
Pretty good.
Yeah?
What you been up to?
Not much.
No? You still hanging with that kid Joe? Yeah.
And he's still your best friend?
Yeah, I guess.
Okay. How about you? How was your week?
Fine.
What you been up to? Nothing, really.
You, um, still working on that sculpture project?
Yeah.
Almost finished.
Yeah? What's it of?
Nothing.
All right, no, no, no.
No, that is not how we are going to talk to one another. All right?
No, I will not be that guy.
You cannot put me in that category, all right? "The biological father that I spend every other week with," "and I make polite conversation"
No!
Talk to me.
Samantha, how was your week?
"I don't know, Dad, it was kinda tough."
"Billy and Ellen broke up, and Ellen's kinda mad at me,"
"'cause she saw me talking to Billy in the cafeteria."
"And you remember that sculpture I was working on,"
"well, it was a unicorn,"
"and the horn broke off, so now it's a zebra," okay?
"But I still think I'm gonna get an right?"
Mason, how was your week?
"Well, Dad, you know it was kinda tough."
"Joey's kind of a jerk, actually."
"He stole some cigarettes from his mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em,"
"but I said no because I knew" "what a hard time you had quitting smoking, Dad."
How 'bout that?
Is that so hard?
Dad, these questions are kind of hard to answer.
What is so hard to answer about what sculpture are you making?
It's abstract.
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
See, I didn't know that.
I didn't know you were even interested in abstract art.
I'm not. They make us do it.
But, Dad, why is it all on us, though?
What about you?
How was your week?
Who do you hang out with?
Do you have a girlfriend?
What have you been up to?
I see your point.
So we should just let it happen more natural, right?
That's what you're saying?
Okay, that's what we'll do.
Starting now.
Check this out.
That would be a...
That would be a Magnificent Owl.
Caligo atreus. - What's that one? Look at this.
- Whoa! What kind is that? That looks like a Zebra Longwing.
All right.
Cool.
This one's incredible.
That's the owl one, right?
Yeah.
Magnificent Owl.
I think he went pee-pee on you, bud.
One, two, three, four, five.
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Yo, Mase, look at me here.
Make a diamond with your hands, all right?
Fingers and thumbs.
Keep your hands soft.
Sam.
Very nice.
That's how you want to catch it, just like that.
Even when you're running, that's what you're thinking about, that diamond.
That diamond and soft hands.
There it is.
No, no, no.
Yes!
Don't let her get...
No, no, no!
Let's go, Roger!
That's it, Roger!
Yeah!
Guy's incredible.
He's unhittable this year.
Now, just so you know, what we're watching here is history.
Now, you see this guy out here?
This dude is like 43 years old, and he's striking out guys half his age.
This guy's ERA is 1.47, all right?
Can you believe that?
Now, if the Astros could just get a few runs, maybe we'd win a game.
Dad, do you have a job?
Why would you ask me that?
I don't know.
Mom wanted to know, and I didn't know what the answer was.
Mom wanted to know.
All right.
Well, you can tell Mom that I just happen to have passed my second actuarial exam, all right?
So, tell her that.
How's she doing?
Is she finishing school? Yep, all A's.
All A's?
Like mother, like daughter, right?
He got that!
That's out...
Yeah!
Look at that!
Yeah!
Mason!
Yes!
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Samantha! Hey. What's up, Jimmy?
What's going on, Mason, man?
Astros won.
You went to the game?
What, I'm the only one with any arms around here?
Nobody else can carry anything?
Help their old man out?
What you watching?
Come on, Jimmy, man! You knew the kids were coming this weekend.
Can't you just help me out a little bit?
I'm sorry, muffin.
Yeah, don't "muffin" me, all right?
Don't put me in that position.
I'm not your fuckin' Tony Randall.
Dad, it's always a mess.
It was not a mess this morning. Okay?
I mowed the lawn. Yeah?
Great.
Come on, man!
Turn this shit off. Come on, give me that thing.
Did you watch the game?
No. Lane won it with a three-run homer.
It was beautiful, wasn't it?
Sam lost her mind.
She's a huge Astros fan. Sure.
Saturday night was a lunar eclipse
I sang 'em a song Went something like this
Well, go to sleep, my weary babies
Let the sounds roll on by
Tonight we're safe here in Houston
With this, your daddy's lullaby
Your mother's got a new husband now He seems all right
I wonder if he's reading them stories
And kissing them good night
Well, babysitters say they miss me
I know I shouldn't hope it's true
Teacher says my son paints pictures of a family All in blue
She says she caught him whispering to the window
Will Daddy please come home?
I know I could call him up
But what if his mother answers the phone?
You brush your teeth? What?
Did you brush your teeth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You gonna fall asleep with those things in your head?
Maybe.
Yeah, well, try not to, all right?
Okay.
Want me to turn off the light? Okay.
Sure.
Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Jimmy.
Hey. That was a fun day, right?
Yeah, it was. Sorry.
Why?
That Mason had to be there, you know.
Good night.
Good night.
Dad?
There's no, like, real magic in the world, right?
What do you mean?
You know, like elves and stuff.
People just made that up.
I don't know.
I mean, what makes you think that elves are any more magical than something like a whale?
What if I told you a story about how underneath the ocean, there was this giant sea mammal that used sonar and sang songs and it was so big that its heart was the size of a car and you could crawl through the arteries?
I mean, you'd think that was pretty magical, right?
Yeah.
But, like, right this second, there's, like, no elves in the world, right?
No.
Technically, no elves.
Love you, guys.
All right.
Be well. See you, Dad.
Have a great week.
Sam, I'll see you next weekend?
All right. Yeah, that's right. What?
Suzy has a birthday party next Saturday.
A sleepover?
All right.
I'll talk to your mom about it.
Bye, Dad. Don't worry about it, okay?
Have a great week. Okay. Had a great time.
How do you guys not know how to do this?
I'll make you some bookmarks.
Just a second. Pictures...
She looks nice.
Randy, Mason, Dad wants you guys downstairs.
Why?
You're getting haircuts.
This is gonna look so much better.
You're gonna look like a man, instead of like a little girl.
You're taking the eyebrows off next, right, Byron?
Mason, we're leaving.
You're not sick.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Mom.
Where's Mason?
He doesn't feel too good.
I don't think he's going to school.
He's totally faking it.
Bye.
Mason, what's going on?
I don't feel good.
Yeah, well, your head feels fine. So get your ass out of bed.
I'm gonna drive you to school.
You got five minutes, and don't make me late.
I mean, he didn't even ask!
He just cut it.
It's my hair!
Well, no wonder you were angry. I'd be angry, too.
I look like a Martian now.
Honey, you know what?
I'm gonna talk to him about it later.
Okay?
Yeah, I tried to call you, but you didn't answer your phone.
I'm so sorry.
I've been so busy with school.
For what it's worth, it's hair and it will grow back.
And now I can see your pretty eyes and your foxy face.
Why did you even marry him?
He's such a jerk!
Well, Bill has his good qualities.
You know, nobody's perfect.
And now we have a family.
We already had a family.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Please join me in the Texas Pledge.
Honor the Texas flag.
I pledge allegiance to thee,
Texas one and indivisible.
Thank you. You may be seated.
All right.
All right, class, as you know, we've been working on our mythology projects, and you're going to be writing papers about gods and goddesses.
We've listed those gods and goddesses here on the board.
We added a couple of monsters for some of you who might be interested in that.
And you're going to write your essay about your god and goddess, and to make sure that you cover everything, let's make sure that we do all of these things right here.
First of all, you need to name your god or goddess, and you need to include who, what, when, where, why and how.
So make sure that you cover all those things when you're writing your essay.
There's a bump right there.
I'll see you later, guys. Yeah.
- Mom, are you okay?
- What happened?
No. Go in the house!
Go!
Go in the house! Go in the house!
Your mother had a little accident.
Now she's being dramatic.
Get off the fucking floor, Olivia.
I'm having a drink with my dinner.
Anybody else have a problem with that?
Samantha?
No.
Mindy?
No.
I didn't think so.
You don't like me much, do you, Mason?
That's okay. I don't like me either.
You think that's funny?
You think that's fuckin' funny?
What's the matter, you feeling a little left out?
Clean it up, God damn it!
Clean it up.
Bill!
Clean it up, God damn it!
I hate squash!
Pearl.
I'm gonna pay you. I'm working three jobs right now.
How many times can you watch that, Mason?
It's funny.
I'm driving a cab.
I'm inside with my buddy right now just going over my résumé.
Okay, you know what?
You need to relax.
Look, why do you need your money so fast?
- Has he ever gotten this bad before?
- No. But he's yelled a lot.
Yeah, but he hasn't thrown and broken stuff.
Yeah. You're drunk.
I knew it. You're already drunk.
Give me your cell phones.
So nobody talked to her?
Mason?
No.
Mindy?
No.
I believe you.
Samantha?
No.
I didn't talk to her. She left a message.
What'd she say?
Nothing much.
What did she say?
She said she'd be back later.
And that's all, "I'll be back later," click?
She said, "Stay in your rooms.
I'll be back later."
I'll be back later, stay in your rooms.
And that's all?
Yeah.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Where is she?
She didn't say!
All right. Everybody, get in the car.
Hurry up! Get in the car!
It's still not working.
Bullshit.
She took it all.
All right, Randy, go cash this.
Tell them I'm not feeling well or something.
I don't know.
Mason, go with him.
Here.
There's my ID.
Hi, good afternoon, fellas. What can I do for you today?
Now what's this? Can't read this.
Hey!
This isn't you!
Who is this?
It's our dad.
He's not feeling well.
Hey! Yeah, I know him.
Okay, here we go.
Five hundred bucks.
One, two, three, four...
Five hundred bucks.
All right?
Don't forget your dad's ID.
Now take care of your dad now, son. You only got the one.
Damn it.
Get outta the way.
Jesus Christ.
God...
Calm down!
Samantha!
Mason!
Samantha!
Where the hell have you been?
I'm leaving you, Bill. We're moving out.
I doubt that.
Samantha, Mason!
Come down!
No, don't think so.
Who's this?
- I'm not here for you!
- Really?
I know, you're here to protect my wife from me.
Well, thank you so much, you two.
Okay, stay back!
Why don't you come inside here?
Come inside here.
Where the hell are you going?
Get your ass upstairs! You're not going anywhere.
Stop! Come on!
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Get upstairs!
What the hell... Nobody's going anywhere, God damn it!
No, God damn it!
Stop it.
Don't touch my kids!
All right, take 'em. Go on, go on.
- Don't touch them!
- Take 'em.
Take 'em then, just take 'em!
Get in the car. Go!
Get upstairs!
Olivia!
Seat belts!
Put your seat belts on.
Where are we going?
We're going to stay with Carol and her family for a while.
Don't look back.
It's gonna be okay.
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows When we stand hand in hand
Hey, Lee and Mason.
Guys, when you want to take a break, here's a snack.
Going on...
Wildcats in the house Everybody say it loud
Wildcats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air
Abby, why don't you come and help me with this?
Why couldn't Randy and Mindy come with us?
I'm not their legal guardian, honey.
That would be kidnapping.
I can't just... What's gonna happen to them?
What happens when their legal guardian is dangerous and abusive?
I don't know, honey.
I called their mom. I called the Child Protective Services.
I have you and your brother.
We are in a dangerous situation.
You're my responsibility.
Are we ever gonna see them again?
I don't know.
I hope so.
How much longer are we gonna be here?
Not long. We're...
I don't have the answer, baby.
Listen. We are happy to have you here as long as you want.
As long as you need.
This is fun for us, isn't it?
Yeah, it's like having a big sister? Like having a brother.
We're gonna help out, right?
You're not even gonna know we're here. Okay.
Mom, this is awful.
You're dumping me in some parking lot of this school where I don't even know anyone!
I'm leaving all my friends, and I didn't even get to say goodbye!
I don't know where to go!
Samantha, you go right through that door.
The office is right there. They're expecting you. They're gonna give you your schedule.
Here's your lunch money.
I will pick you up right here at 3:30.
I'm wearing dirty clothes because you wouldn't even let us get our stuff!
We don't even have a place to live!
This sucks!
Samantha, I'm doing the best I can!
And you're right, it sucks!
But it doesn't suck half as much as having a drunk fool slam your head against a wall!
So out your horseshit attitude!
Put your seat belt on!
You know, if you need anything, I'm in Room 112, right? Okay.
This is Mrs. Darby's room.
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Mom.
Are you Mason?
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Mrs. Darby.
I'm glad to meet you.
Why don't you sit here?
Kenny!
Off. Yes, ma'am.
Kenny, this is Mason, and I want you to show him around today, okay?
Got it.
Hey, dude.
Welcome to the suck.
Everybody, listen up!
We have a new student joining us today.
His name is Mason, he's sitting in the back row.
Kenny's going to be his buddy, but I want each one of you to take the time today to introduce yourselves and welcome him to school.
Okay?
All right?
Let's get started.
What?
Hi.
Can I put an Obama sign in your yard?
Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama supporter?
No.
This is private property. Get off.
I could shoot you!
What a dick.
He had a Confederate flag on his house. I love it.
Young Obama supporters out on the trail, this is great!
Are you doing this through your school?
Um, our dad's a big supporter.
That's great. I mean, we have just got to pull together to get this win, right?
Yeah.
I just love him so much!
I have these dreams where I'm just kissing him, 'cause I just love him so much!
He's so cute, isn't he? Yeah.
You know, I made these T-shirts for my kids.
"My Mama's For Obama." Do you like it? Yeah.
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the sign!
- No problem.
All right!
Looks good!
How many you got left, two?
All right, all right, we're done.
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Sam.
Go get that McCain sign, would you? What?
Get the McCain sign.
Go rip it up, come on.
Get it, get it, get it, go. go, go!
Good job, good job.
Proud of you, son.
You guys are gonna get us arrested.
Look, I'm a patriot, all right?
And sometimes in this life you gotta fight.
And what is it that you do at these parties?
I don't know. Talk, dance, listen to music.
And that's more fun to you than going camping with your brother and your father who love you.
Yes.
Sorry. Wow. Is there gonna be alcohol there?
Probably not.
Maybe some of the seniors.
I know what this party is.
The parents are out of town, right?
Somebody's scored a keg, right? You guys are gonna have a good time, trash the whole house.
Right?
Am I right?
No.
No, Dad. Amy's really responsible.
Who's gonna be there?
Marie, Christine, Amy. Everyone.
Is that guy on your Facebook page, is he gonna be there?
Who?
Come on, the guy that's got his arm wrapped around you, with his hair over his eyes.
Garret?
Garret. Is that his name?
All right.
Is Garret gonna be there?
Probably.
Probably.
You see?
I learn more about her from her Facebook page than I do from our scintillating conversation.
Is he your boyfriend?
Kind of.
Have you met him?
Has he been around the house?
Sometimes.
Sometimes? Zzz?
You have a boyfriend! Wow.
Have you heard of Sarah Palin?
Yes.
What's the one thing you know about Sarah Palin's 17-year-old daughter?
She's pregnant?
That's right.
And what is the one thing that you are not going to be in a couple of years when you turn 17?
Pregnant?
That's right!
All right, now, what are the two ways that you can achieve that goal?
First is not have any sex, okay?
That's the first way, okay? Just not engage in that. That did not work out very well for your mother and me.
And what's the second way?
Where you going? Bathroom.
You don't have to go to the bathroom.
Sit down, Mason, just sit down.
What's the second way?
Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff?
No, Dad! No, come on, has she talked to you about contraception?
What, has she...
Condoms? She talked about that?
No, Dad, please, stop.
What?
Does Garret have a condom?
God!
Dad! What? Come on.
Sam, we have to be able to talk about this, all right? Come on, we do.
We can do it, we can do it.
Just stay with me here, all right? It's as hard for me as it is for you.
But seriously, all right? I read an article in the paper the other day that said that although US teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy, okay?
Hey.
Hey, Tammy, how you doing?
What's going on?
Nice to see you. Yeah, good to see you.
Yeah.
Um, Tammy, this is my daughter Samantha.
Hey.
And this is, Mason Junior right here.
- Mason Junior.
- Tammy. Say hi.
Hi.
Hi, Mason, nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you guys.
What're you doing here? I'm just here with some friends.
Wow.
Yeah. What are you guys up to?
Um, we're going camping.
Well, no, this one is not going camping.
This one is going to a party. Fun.
But we, the men, are going camping.
The boys are going camping.
All right, very nice.
Well, we still on for tomorrow?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I'll drop him off at 7:00 and then I'll just call you. Okay.
Right?
Great.
It was really nice meeting you both.
Take care.
Talk to you soon. Bye.
I'll see you. I'll see you.
Don't look at me like that, all right?
Look, just to finish the point, okay?
I was 23 when your mom had you, all right?
So was she. All right, and we didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents.
And I wish that... I wish I were a better parent to you guys, all right? And I hope that you can learn from my mistakes, okay?
All right. So wear a condom, okay?
Or get Garret to... I don't know, whatever.
Listen to this song, all right?
I try to stay busy Just straight-up...
The lyrics in this, straight-up old-school country song.
I do the dishes I mow the lawn
Listen to the production of this.
Production's like Abbey Road or something.
Even though I know You're not coming home You know, his old woman's gone.
Straight-up. Nothing fancy.
Keeping things clean Doesn't change anything Yeah, I think she's about to get her master's degree.
Well, then she's gonna start applying for teaching jobs? I think she already has.
Really? Where?
All over.
All over Texas?
Yeah.
Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know?
It's no big deal.
We can handle that.
I'll still come get you every other weekend.
I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something, it'll just be a little bit more car time.
No big deal.
I'm just kind of sick of moving.
Well, I bet you are.
But, you know, you never know.
I might have to move. Right?
I'm working for this insurance company now. These places get bought and sold all the time.
You know, we'll just roll with it.
I thought you were a musician.
I am, but life is expensive, you know?
Guy's got to be responsible.
What do you think?
Hey!
Punk kid! You got no respect!
You know that redhead at the bowling alley?
Sure. What about her?
Do you know her well?
You know, we've hung out a little bit.
Is she your girlfriend?
How do you mean?
Like, have you kissed her?
Yeah. Yeah, I've kissed her.
What about you?
Have you got a girlfriend? Sort of.
Really?
Have you, kissed her?
Not really.
Yeah?
What have you done?
Well, we talked on the phone.
Yeah!
How did that go?
Pretty terrible.
Why?
Well, when we're at school, we got plenty to talk about, but when we're alone or on the phone, it's like we have nothing in common.
Nothing?
She's not interested in music or video games or...
Three best movies this summer.
Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and Pineapple Express.
Yeah, what about 'em?
She said they all sucked.
Okay, what's she interested in?
I don't know.
Going to the mall with her stupid friends?
Well, is she cute?
Watch your step there. Yeah.
Yeah?
All right.
Well, here's what you do, all right?
First off, you gotta ask her a lot of questions.
Then you have to listen to the answers, all right?
Actually be interested in her, all right?
If you can do those things, you're gonna be light years ahead of all the other guys.
Okay. This is the best s'more I ever made in my life, all right? This is absolute peak.
Look at this. Yeah. Yeah.
Honey brown, no burn.
Look at that?
Sell that in the store.
That's like advertisement worthy.
Advertisement quality.
Yeah.
You think they ever will make another Star Wars?
I don't know. I think if they were gonna make another one, that the period where this game is set is where it would have to be, 'cause there's nothing after, really.
Yeah. No, Return of the Jedi, it's over. There's nothing...
Yeah, there's nothing else to do there.
You gonna turn Han Solo into a Sith Lord?
Yeah. What are you gonna do?
Good morning. Morning.
You gotta pee?
Sure.
Hit the campfire.
Ancient Native American custom.
You're gonna give back to the Earth what you take from it, and you don't burn the forest down.
Okay, guys, have a good day!
Mason, don't forget, I have to teach late today. Sam's gonna pick you up. Right, Sam?
All right.
Okay.
Bye, guys. See you.
Hey.
That's what I was talking to you about.
Yeah.
Good luck with that.
See you, man.
Don't bump into me! Little bitch!
I didn't!
You calling me a liar? No.
Don't act like you're tough shit, motherfucker.
I don't think pretty boy's hair's good enough.
Don't touch me, faggot!
You're a fuckin' asshole.
Hey, Mason! Hey, Jill.
So, where're you going?
Over to the college.
What's going on there?
My mom's a teacher.
Cool.
What does she teach?
Psychology, I think.
What're you up to?
My mom owns Needleworks. The arts and crafts store over there.
So I'm just kinda hangin' out.
But I'm supposed to be going to the hospital soon.
How come?
You know Courtney?
Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring?
Wears Hot Topic every day?
I think so.
We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kind of grown apart.
She sorta got all emo, she thinks I'm a prep, but I still consider her a friend.
Anyway, she cut one of her wrists.
I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit.
So what're you reading?
It's Breakfast of Champions.
Kurt Vonnegut.
I think my older brother likes him.
I'm reading To Kill a Mockingbird for the third time.
My friends make fun of me.
I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the Twilight books.
Have you read 'em?
Sure haven't.
I tried, but it was so cheesy!
So, how do you like San Marcos?
I like it all right.
It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool.
Have you always lived here?
Yeah.
If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin.
Have you been there yet?
I went to San Antonio for a day, but I haven't been to Austin yet.
That's where all the high school kids go on weekends for shows and stuff.
That's what I've heard.
So, are you going to Shauna's party next weekend?
Um, I think I heard about it. I'm not really sure, though. Well, you should!
Why's that?
Well, LeeAnne has a big crush on you, and I know she was hoping you would go.
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?
Not currently.
Well then, you should come.
I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.
Okay.
But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.
I won't.
Well, I better get going.
See you later.
His cognitive theories, his interviews with orphans, ethology theorists' work, and then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study.
Now, you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950s, this was radical!
This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning.
Now, Bowlby's gonna argue that human survival depends on us falling in love.
It depends on me falling in love with my mother and my mother falling in love with me.
And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed.
Now think about it.
A tiger chases her tribe out of a cave
Now, an ideal mother goes,
"My baby! I love you, I'll protect you!"
Or, "Well, you, why am I gonna pick you up?
You're gonna slow me down."
"You are tiger kibble!"
So, next week, we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment.
Professor Douglas and I... Some of you might have classes with Elena. She and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by.
I'm not the greatest cook.
Thanks.
Samantha!
Why the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would?
Okay. Mom...
Mom, I know what you're gonna say.
She was running late and we couldn't turn around. No, no!
No excuses!
The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do!
You stranded your brother!
It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around and go get some kid at the middle school.
What do you mean "some kid"?
He's your brother!
And you know what? We've helped Janey out before.
She lives right around the corner.
It's no big deal. Sorry.
You know what, Samantha? You need to start thinking long and hard about who you wanna be.
Do you wanna be a cooperative person who's compassionate and helps people out... or do you wanna be a self-centered narcissist?
You're right. I am this horrible person. But, honestly, he's not a baby anymore.
You don't have to treat him like one.
He's in eighth grade, and he can find his way home if he wants to.
You know what?
When Gabi leaves, you and me are gonna have a chat.
Awkward.
Dude, that sucks.
Hey, man, what's up?
We're going camping tonight. You in?
Who's going?
My brother, one of his friends, and Tony maybe.
Yeah, let me check with my mom.
Mom, can I go camping with Chase tonight?
Camping?
Where? At that house that his family's building. It's pretty much finished.
Well, will any adults be there?
His brother's a senior.
You have your cell phone?
Yeah.
Is it charged?
Okay, do me a favor. Leave his parents' number and the address on the counter.
Okay.
Yeah!
What I'm talking about!
That's it.
You ready? Check this shit out.
That was all right, but this is gonna be badass.
All right, let me see.
Let me see what you can do.
All right. This is your face.
I'm about to break his face, right here.
All right, man. All right, now check this out.
You might want to move.
That'd be painful.
In the kidneys, right? The stomach? Something.
Check this out, man.
Pancreas.
That shit's lethal.
Yeah, that would be painful. Man, have a beer, man. That was awesome.
Here.
It's beer 30, children. Nice.
No, thanks.
Come on, man. What are you?
A pussy?
I just don't feel like drinking a beer right now.
Man, if you're too chickenshit to even have a beer, I know for a fact that you have never gotten any pussy.
Like you guys have.
Sure have.
When?
Last summer.
- With who?
- It was awesome.
Chase went down easy street and fucked this whore Nancy.
At least, that's what he said. I did.
Would I lie?
Bullshit.
Quick, where were you?
At Tober's house.
And she fucked a couple other guys, too.
His first piece of ass was sloppy seconds.
What about you, Mason?
You ever got any? Yeah, you ever made her, howl into the night?
A few times.
Really?
Yeah, right, what was her name?
No.
Jennifer.
She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston.
You're fucking lying.
I don't care if you assholes believe me or not.
Let me guess, you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here, lefty.
Hey, fuck you.
I would, but none of the girls here want to.
Dude, it's not what they want, man, it's what you want.
True dat.
You know what you should do, join a band.
That's all it takes, man.
Yeah?
Fuck, yeah, dude.
You don't even have to play that well.
You start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blowjobs.
Except for you.
It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.
I'm not in the fucking marching band.
Dude, you sure?
I heard you play the skin flute.
All right, I got a question for you guys.
If you think you're so cool, why you hanging out with a bunch of 8th graders on a Friday night?
Hey. Fuck you, you little penis wrinkle.
You're lucky to even be here.
This is our camp-out.
The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother and then he drags along you little dice danglers.
Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit!
It's all good, man.
These little fuzz nuts are going to get their chance soon enough.
We got some whores coming by later.
- Yeah?
- Hell yeah!
Now, I know Chase will fuck anything.
I mean, I've seen this kid mount boulders before.
But what about you guys? You in?
- Whatever.
- All right.
Good man. All right. What about you, Peter Puffer?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there.
I'm not gay.
Give it some time, man. You'll realize.
Fuck y'all.
See, that's exactly my point, man.
Nah, but we don't have whores coming over.
We were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.
And you just earned your vag badge.
Put it next to your bitch card.
Yeah, 'cause, you know, you're a bitch.
Now hold this like the bitch you are, bitch.
All right, this shit is called the death punch.
Whoa, Jesus!
Hey.
You guys made it!
Good.
There you are.
Wow. And here you go, hostess.
Thank you.
Can I get you a bite?
That's cool.
Thanks. You did that?
Yeah.
Wow. How long have you been doing that for?
Not very long.
Um... I went to this camp thing just this past summer.
They have a camp for graffiti?
Well, they call it "urban art."
So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but it was really just a way to get free spray paint.
Cool. So is this your tag?
Is that... Do they still call it...
Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing.
It's a "K..."
E.
"E-Z-J-O." Kez Jo.
That's cool.
It doesn't really mean anything, though.
Is that your dad?
Yeah.
Where's he live?
In Houston.
Get to see him much?
Yeah. Some weekends and over the summer.
Cool. So, you're a student of my mom's, right?
Yeah, I got one class with her.
How's she doing?
You know, is she a good teacher and everything?
Yeah, she's great!
She's super-smart and she cares, you know. She makes it interesting.
She's probably even my favorite teacher.
So, anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the ASB.
So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 4-56 was there 'cause we were bumping House of Pain. It was like, "Jump around, jump around."
And the whole family's coming outside, you got the kids and, the mom and the dad and they're all bouncing up and down, we're throwing out candies for the kids and soccer balls and Beanie Babies and Frisbees,
smokes for the adults, and, they loved, they absolutely loved Gatorade.
But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor.
I don't know what it was.
Yeah.
Couldn't give it away. How long were you over there?
I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia.
Wow.
Did you enlist?
Yeah, I was, um, Army National Guard, and, you know, coming straight out of high school, needed money for college.
And, did my tour. And whenever I got done I told them, if there's a world-changing event, I'll come back.
And, three months later 9/11 happened, and I was back 9/12.
And I'm proud to say the 4-56, the whole time we were there, we never lost a guy, not one casualty.
But is that odd? Is that unusual?
Yeah.
Almost impossible.
Like, the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice.
They did, basically, the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month.
Wow. What did you guys do differently?
I like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know.
All the time we spent over there building trust, these guys basically destroyed it in three days.
So, what did the locals think about why we're there?
Oil, plain and simple.
Hey, Mason.
One last hit.
Hey. Mickey Mouse Club.
Get the fuck out of my car.
Just crawl out the back window or something, man.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll see you on Sunday night.
All right. You better text me.
Do you have any gum?
Yeah, I do, actually.
Here you go. Thanks.
See ya.
And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's been corrupting this nation.
Yeah, because those who heart Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to.
Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin.
We have to follow that example.
You're right.
Hey, Mason, what time is it?
Like 12:15.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday!
Mason.
It's your birthday?
Just now, I guess. Yeah, how old are you?
Fifteen.
Fifteen.
Give me a hug.
Happy birthday.
My goodness!
Have you been drinking?
Have you?
Yeah, a little.
Have you?
A little bit.
Have you been...
A little bit.
I'm gonna go to sleep.
Talk in the morning?
Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
Good.
Whose car is that? That's our car.
Hop on in there.
Hey. Hi, sweetie.
Hey, Cooper.
Hey!
How's it going?
Hello, little brother.
He's so cute.
Can we just replace that part of the pipe? No, is no good.
Everything is no good.
Everything.
Yes, Mira.
This one is...
Stronger.
This is better, yes, yes, yes.
Hey, listen, thanks for that camera you got Mason.
Yeah, Mason's all into the photography.
He's loving that thing. Yeah, I know.
He's actually talking about turning his, closet into a darkroom.
Like the red light and the developing, the whole nine...
You all right with that? I probably won't see him for a week.
Yeah. Right.
But he's having a good time.
At least he's focused on something. Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I like. Yeah, he's all about it.
Okay, let's go grande.
It's good?
It's better, yes. It's good.
You know, you're smart.
You should be in school.
I like school, I need school, but it's hard, I working all day.
Go to night school at community college. It's pretty affordable.
You're doing a nice job with the house.
It's looking great.
Thanks. Really great.
Yeah, you know, some fix-its here and there.
We got a good deal on a foreclosure, so now I'm finding out why.
Yeah, really.
Hey, bud!
Hey.
Happy birthday?
What's that?
What's that?
That's our new car.
Get in it.
All right. Have a good weekend.
How you doing?
Good to see you.
You, too.
Hey!
Hey, how are you?
You look great.
Thanks.
Look at him!
Aw, he's got Mason's nose.
- Yeah, isn't he cute? - Yeah. - All right!
- Love you guys.
We got a big drive ahead of us.
Bye, Sam.
You guys drive safe.
All right.
Well, we'll be back tomorrow night.
I'm so glad you were born!
So, this is like Annie's car and you drive the GTO?
I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing.
Yeah, no.
But I had to sell that anyway.
You what?
Yeah, I had to sell that.
So it's gone?
Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid 22 grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash.
I only paid $8,500 for that thing way back when.
Cars are generally a terrible investment, you know.
Soon as you drive them off the lot, you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there.
But if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, the value starts going up again.
Shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra.
What?
You don't remember?
Remember what?
Really?
You said that was going to be my car when I turned 16.
What?
No, I didn't.
I never said that. I remember.
I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nadar's house for his birthday, and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block, and he was talking about how much he loved your car,
and so you were all like, "This is gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."
All right, first off, I have no memory of that, all right?
Second of all, I would never say that.
You did, though.
What?
Mason.
Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her?
Come on, how's that fair?
Anthony Nagar. What...
Are you...
Come on!
I mean, you're not...
Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, all right, but bottom line is, that was my car.
All right?
I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it.
All right? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it, but when you get older, you can save up and buy a car of your own.
Be cool like I used to be.
Or you can get a minivan.
Does your mom actually let you watch this? Yeah.
She likes it, too.
Okay, well, have you ever seen her in concert?
No, but she's coming to Houston in April.
She's coming to Houston?
Your dad and I could get you tickets and you could stay with us.
That'd be great!
Yeah.
- Hey, Annie?
- Yup. Will you get me the little birthday present for Mason?
Here, babe. All right.
This one needs a little explanation, okay?
Open it up.
I call that the Beatles Black Album.
What it is, is the best of John, Paul, George and Ringo, solo, post-breakup.
Thanks. Basically, I put the band back together for you.
Whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know?
But you put them next to each other, right, and they start to elevate each other, and then you can hear it.
It's The Beatles, you know?
I don't know.
I think I always just liked Paul the best.
It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point.
There is no favorite Beatle!
That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world, okay?
And there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered, all right, and now it has been carefully found, arranged and ordered for you by your loving father.
Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father.
Yes, yes, yes.
So, I mean, look at that, look at that.
Top of Volume II, first four tracks, you've got Band on the Run into My Sweet Lord into Jealous Guy into Photograph.
Come on! It's like the perfect segue.
You got Paul, who takes you to the party,
George who talks to you about God,
John is just, "No, it's about love and pain,"
and then Ringo who just says,
"Hey. Can't we enjoy what we have while we have it?"
It's a good record.
I shit you not.
Cool.
Hey, there, Cliff.
Hey, how you doing?
Good. How you doing? Hi, birthday boy!
It's good to see you. It's great to see you.
Yeah.
You made it all right?
Yeah, we sure did. We sure did.
How are you, darling?
Let's just get this one... All right, we ready?
Yeah.
Wait.
Hey, Sam.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, still sleeping here?
Yeah. Hey, buddy.
Make a wish, make a wish.
Real good! Presents!
Wait, wait, wait.
Here, sweetie.
Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up?
All right.
I hope you like it.
I heard you didn't have one, so.
It's a Bible.
This is your first Bible.
Look, there's your name.
Wow.
In gold. And wait, wait, wait.
Look at this.
It's a red-letter edition, and that means that everything that Jesus said is in red.
Thank you.
You like it?
All right. I love you, sweetie.
Happy birthday.
And this one's from us.
Yeah, here.
It's not going to make all your dreams come true here.
Just keep your expectations low.
No, you need it. It's...
Come on, right?
You gotta have it.
You need this. You got life ahead of you.
And the shirt is blue.
You got dances and job interviews.
Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here.
Mason?
Come here, son.
Pull that off.
There's a 20-gauge shotgun.
Wow.
My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him.
Well, you're 15 and I'd like for you to have it, all right?
Here, you hold it.
Yeah?
Thank you.
Congratulations, son.
I'll teach you how to clean it, teach you how to fire it.
I'll teach you a little bit of safety.
Now cock it.
All right, there you go.
Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight. Here, you see this little V right here?
Now which one you aiming at?
The middle can.
The middle can?
All right.
Now fire at will, all right?
Ho!
Whoa!
Yeah!
All right, watch out, watch out.
Whoa. Be careful. All right.
Ready?
Pull!
You hit a little low.
Wait till it gets up high, then shoot, all right?
'Cause then it's a better aim coming down.
Remember, second trigger.
Ready?
Pull!
Look what you did!
Well, you nailed it, didn't you?
How did that feel?
Felt good. Yeah, it felt good.
Good.
Well, I want for us to be together forever
But to wander wherever I may
I want you to be easy and casual
But still demand I stay
I want for you to know me completely But still remain mysterious
Consider everything deeply But still remain fearless
Climb to the top Look over the ledge
Dance barefoot on a razor's edge
Reach for the stars Grab a tiger by the tail
If I don't try, I'll never fail
If you go home You're rolling the dice
Can't step in the same river twice
You love too much It'll turn to hate
You never leave home You'll never be late
You eat too much You're gonna get fat
If you buy a dog You'll piss off your cat
So take a deep breath and enjoy the ride
'Cause arrivals and departures Run side by side
You're our first audience, you know?
Mason demanded we work on it the whole time.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's a work in progress.
A week later, we don't know why
Thomas wasn't there the first time, but a week later, Thomas comes back and joins the other disciples.
They say, "The Lord's alive, we saw him!"
"I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side,"
"and I wanna see those nail prints in his hands."
About that time, here comes Jesus standing right next to him, okay?
And he turns to Thomas.
Don't you know, Thomas felt some shame.
He turns to Thomas and says,
"Thomas, here, stick your finger in my side."
"Look at these nail prints.
It's me."
And Thomas says, "My Lord and my God, I believe."
And Jesus said, "Well, that's good,"
"but blessed are those who can believe without seeing."
It's a lot easier when you can see and feel and touch, but like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh, we haven't felt him in the flesh, but we have experienced him in the spirit.
At least, I have, and I hope y'all have, too.
The pond's right up here.
It's low.
Yeah.
You know, my dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want.
Thanks.
Hi, baby.
What's goin' on?
No, I think we're just gonna hang here for a minute.
You want me to stay with you?
No, it's okay.
You sure? Yeah. Thanks.
Mason, why are you such a stick-in-the-mud?
What are you even talking about?
You guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?
No, that's fine.
Sam?
I appreciate it.
It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know.
Were we baptized?
I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul.
We can do it now, though, if you want.
No, I think I'm all right.
You and Cooper together, you know.
Dunk your heads.
You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?
And what's that supposed to mean?
I can hear you!
Wow.
I think that shotgun should live at my house?
I don't think your mom would love that.
Look out, Sam.
Let me show you how it's done.
Nice, Dad.
Still got the goods?
How long you been in here, Mason?
I'm not sure.
I'm sure.
All class.
Did you complete your image diary?
Not yet.
Completed your, digital contact sheet?
Not quite, but it's not gonna take me long.
Not yet.
Not quite.
Dark room time is extra-curricular.
I mean, technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments.
That's the deal.
Sorry.
I'm worried about you, Mason.
Why is that?
I'll tell you why.
The images you're turning in, they're cool.
You're looking at things in a really unique way.
Got a lot of natural talent.
Thanks. Yeah, but that and 50 cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world.
I've met a lot of talented people over the years.
How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment and a really good work ethic?
I can tell you.
I can count it on two fingers.
Zero.
It's not gonna happen for you, Mason.
The world is too competitive.
There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard, and a butt load of morons who are untalented who are more than willing to surpass you.
As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now?
You know what they're doing?
They're doing their assignments.
Which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not.
You're in here.
Now why is that?
You special, Mason?
No, but the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever,
I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.
You like football, Mason?
Not really.
Yeah, I know you don't.
That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight.
Okay?
It starts at 7:30, I want you to get there early, I want you to shoot a full card, 300 images, I want them downloaded,
I want them sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday.
You want to know why I'm doing this?
I guess. Who do you want to be, Mason?
What do you want to do?
I want to take pictures.
Make art.
Any dipshit can take pictures, Mason.
Art, that's special.
What can you bring to it that nobody else can?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Try harder.
Maybe in 20 years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say,
"Thank you, sir,"
"for that terrific darkroom chat we had that day."
Get back to class and do your work.
Hey, man, you're walkin' a little funny.
Fuck you.
I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time.
Just hope he bought you dinner first.
Mason!
Honey, come down for dinner.
Samantha! You didn't post these pictures and their descriptions?
This auction is gonna end on Sunday, honey. You've gotta get those posted.
Why are we even doing this?
It's like an online junk shop.
I thought you had a good job.
I do.
We're what you call house poor.
Everyone's got to do their part.
Your brother took the pictures. You have to help.
Who even buys this shit?
Hey.
Sam, watch your mouth, all right?
Don't disrespect your mother.
You like a roof over your head, don't you?
Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone?
I'm not even gonna be here next year.
I'm a senior. I should be having fun.
Nice nails.
Yeah, some girl did that in sixth period.
You planning on keeping them?
Until it comes off, I guess.
Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails.
You got a purse to go with all that?
A lot of guys do that.
He's just trying to be cool.
When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool.
Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water.
Hey, man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game.
So take your lens and point it that way.
Jesus Christ.
Also, we got a ride.
McCormick's gonna take us to the party.
We're gonna head out after the game. You're goin', okay?
Okay.
Shoot the game.
First one!
What was that?
What was that?
What is up?
Hey, what's up?
Hey.
How's it goin'?
Pretty good. How long have you been here?
I don't know. Awhile, I guess.
Awhile?
I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.
Why aren't you?
I mean, I guess it's just being afraid of what people would think.
You know, judgment.
Yeah.
I guess it's really easy to say like, "I don't care what anyone else thinks," but everyone does, you know?
Deep down.
I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with just for controlling me or whatever, but, you know, they're not even aware they're doing it.
Yeah.
So, in this perfect world, where no one's controlling you, what's different?
What changes?
Everything.
I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive.
As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.
Whatever that means.
I don't think it means much.
You're kinda weird, you know that?
Yeah?
Is that a compliment?
I don't know.
Do you wanna be weird?
I mean, I don't want to like scare kids at the park, or anything like that.
I really like talking with you.
I don't usually even try to vocalize my thoughts or feelings or anything.
I don't know, it never sounds right.
Words are stupid.
So, why are you trying with me?
I don't know.
I guess I feel comfortable.
I'm glad.
Hey, Jim.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
What time are you supposed to be home?
I don't know. A while ago.
While ago like, 30 minutes ago, an hour ago?
'Cause truthfully nobody even knew where you were until your sister told us.
She's been home for a while.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that lately.
See, but you don't actually care.
You just kinda come and go as you please, and you don't care if your mom's upset, or what time you gotta be home.
Is that what's up?
I don't know what to tell you.
Stop mumbling!
You know, speak up!
I can't understand a word comin' out of your mouth.
It's just like...
And I ask you questions and you just...
Can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass?
I'm up your ass?
This is my house.
All right? If you wanna live in my house, then you get home when you say you're gonna be home.
You know, Jim, you're not my dad.
No, I'm not your dad.
You know how I know that?
'Cause I'm actually here.
I'm the guy with the job, paying' the bills, takin' care of you, your mom, your sister?
I'm that guy!
Morning.
Morning.
Hey.
Which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last night?
I don't know.
I didn't.
That tall guy, what's his name?
Phillip?
Yeah, Phillip.
He did it.
Can Phillip read? You know, there's a big sign on the door. It says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken."
I mean, how difficult is that?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.
Why?
This house is too big for us.
You're going to school eventually. It's too expensive. I'm done.
Why did you even buy it in the first place then?
Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the brink of poverty.
I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap, and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff.
Really?
Like what?
Well, I got rid of a couple husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage, some maintenance, the tchotchskes, the homeowner's insurance, the property tax, the plumbing.
You know what? From now on, I am gonna be Mommy Monk.
Simple.
Celibate.
Don't be gross, Mom.
Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house.
Is that better?
Okay.
Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash.
I do dishes all day.
Great!
Come on, you could do one or two more for your poor old mom.
Okay.
Thank you.
You want one?
God! She didn't even touch them, seriously. I watched her the whole time.
I bet you did watch her, you little pervert.
It's like we're on a date.
Cheers.
It's a night of romance.
Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you.
I will blow you, though.
Mason! We are in the weeds out here!
I'm goin' as fast as I can.
Then I must be confused then, 'cause I just saw you chatting' it up with April, when I got a salad bar that needs a refill,
I got a six-top, two four-tops I can't use because they haven't been bussed!
Enrique is not here. I'm tryin'.
Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'!
What am I supposed to tell my customers?
"I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it,"
"but Mason's trying."
"At least that's what he told me."
"After he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp."
Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share something with you.
I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, and that's a lot more responsibility.
It's also more money.
How's that sound?
Good.
I know you can handle that money, but can you take the responsibility?
I think you can, because I believe in you.
But I need you on the floor.
Now leave the dishes. Giddy up.
All right, come on!
Don't let me down!
Well, so it's runnin' okay?
That alternator's not messin' up anymore?
No, it's fine.
It's up for the trip.
Are you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?
Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool.
And I guess her roommate's out of town, so it's no big deal.
All right. Did you apply there yet?
Did you get that application in to UT?
Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much in, though.
Right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing, you know?
Seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants.
Yeah.
A little bit of decisiveness goes a long way in this life, all right?
Yeah. Great.
And what about work?
How's that goin'?
I don't know.
It's all right. Today kind of sucked.
This guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world.
People are slobs.
Well, when people ask me about you, I say to them, "Mason, he's doing great."
"He's got a job, he's really cleaning' up."
All right, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you?
Say hi to your big brother. "Hey, big brother."
Hey, Annie.
Hey, kiddo.
Can you say bye-bye?
Bye-bye!
We'll see you soon.
All right. Well, be careful when you're driving, all right?
Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. All right, just.
You're Obi-Wan.
You're centered, patient.
You watch three cars ahead, two behind.
Takes two bad drivers to have an accident, okay?
Okay.
Listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something.
Okay.
All right, buddy.
You have a good one. Bye, Dad.
Hey, honey, take this to your sister.
Throw it in the truck, okay?
Okay, I will. So where is Sheena staying?
At her friend Emily's.
Is Emily a real person?
Yeah.
Yeah, she's a sophomore.
Okay, this is in case of emergency.
Don't spend it, I want it back. Okay.
Thanks.
Did you do your homework?
Most of it, but I can finish tomorrow night.
Honey, 11th grade is really important for college. Don't blow it.
I know, I know.
I mean, we're going to UT and everything.
Don't you want me to come?
"Come on, Sheena, road trip with Mom!" I'll pay for gas.
Fine.
Just kidding.
I have work.
Call me when you get there.
I will.
Have fun!
That sounds to me like just another extreme Mason view of everything.
Not at all!
I finally figured it out.
It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots. I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots.
That's what's going on right now.
Right now?
Yeah! I mean, why not? They're billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything.
We don't cost anything. We're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly.
And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrades.
How?
Seriously.
I read this thing the other day about how... When you hear that ding on your inbox, you get like a dopamine rush in your brain.
It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed.
How evil is that?
We're fucked.
So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that?
Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him?
I still make fun of Trevor though.
It was like he was so pathetically desperate for attention.
That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper.
And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.
That's the thing, though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just wanna try and not live my life through a screen.
I want some kind of actual interaction.
A real person, not just the profile they put up.
I'm sorry.
Were you saying something?
Yeah, okay, I know you're joking.
But, I mean, it's kind of true. You have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, so, what're you really doing?
You don't care what your friends are up to on a Saturday afternoon, but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching.
So, yeah, it's like everyone's just stuck in like an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything.
It's not an experience, it's just information.
Look. For example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight.
Thank you very much, Facebook.
And then I just texted my mom back.
That's groundbreaking.
She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes?
My God, most importantly,
Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig.
Okay, you're right.
That is a really cute, tiny pig.
Our lives can go on.
I want one.
Nice shot.
Yeah, just give the lady at the front y'all's IDs and, she should let you in.
It's Room 206, right? Awesome.
It's not weird that we're staying there, is it?
No, it's fine.
Have fun.
Thank you.
How long have you guys been dating?
About three months.
Yeah, we met at a party and it's been chill.
Yeah, he seems cool. Yeah, he is.
- Does he go to UT, too? Cool.
- Yeah.
What does he study?
He's studying history and Italian, I think, his minor, yeah.
Does he wanna teach Italian?
I think he's still figuring stuff out. Yeah. He'll figure it out.
He's smart. Smart, yeah.
So, where are you thinking about living when you come here?
Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow.
Um... But I know my parents sort of were expecting me to live in a dorm.
But I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.
You don't have to listen to your parents after you turn 18.
Especially if they're not helping you financially.
That's what I figured.
But living in a dorm isn't so bad. Yeah?
I mean, especially if it's a coed dorm.
Yeah.
I mean, I've never been around so many cute guys at once.
Like, college is really fun.
I'm excited.
It's great, yeah.
The last death at the Hoover Dam construction site was his son, Patrick Tierney, who died on December 20th, 1935, exactly 13 years to the day.
See those sorority girls over there?
I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging.
Yeah, in just a few years that's you, and that's gonna be me.
Inlaid into the terrazzo floors was a star map, a celestial map of heavenly bodies so accurately displayed that one could chart the procession of the pole star
14,000 years into the future, such that future generations upon... I wonder what his deal is.
I mean, he obviously has money to eat here. He just said.
He's a UT professor, tenure and everything.
Look at all these people.
What're they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
What are we even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
We know what we're doing here.
Queso.
We have a purpose.
Hell, yeah.
You know, by next summer, this'll just be our lives.
Staying out all night, going to shows, whatever we want.
We ever gonna go to class?
Sometimes.
When it feels right.
When the inspiration hits.
Only then.
Anything else?
More queso?
Yeah.
Jesus.
What?
I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college?
I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just...
I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big, transformative experience.
I don't think it's that transformative.
I just see it as the next step.
But it's like a preordained slot that's already got your name and number on it.
I don't think it's the key to my future.
'Cause, I mean, look at my mom.
She got her degree and got a pretty good job.
She can pay her bills.
I like your mom.
I like my mom, too.
I just mean...
Basically she's still just as fuckin' confused as I am.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- Hey.
Did Sam tell you we were gonna stay here?
No.
Sorry. Um...
She said you were out of town for the weekend.
Yeah, I was. I just got back.
Are you her brother?
Yeah, I'm Mason.
Um, this is Sheena.
Hello.
Great.
All right.
I'm gonna leave my stuff here, if it's okay, and get something to eat.
I'll just come back in a little bit?
Yeah, yeah, we have to get out of here soon anyway.
All right.
It's nice meeting you.
- Yeah. You, too.
- Sorry!
That was so awkward.
Mason, silver-medal winner.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
Heard you got a scholarship.
Yeah.
Yeah, every little bit helps, you know.
Yeah. When you gonna go out there?
End of the summer, I think.
Work some more before then, try to save up some money, at least.
Yeah, before you have to fend for yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's the idea.
Well, how are you feeling about it?
Excited, you know. But kind of half-excited, half-terrified.
Yeah, kind of that voluptuous panic.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Well, it's gonna be good.
It's gonna be crazy good.
I liked college a lot better than high school.
You kinda find your people in college, you know?
Exactly.
You'll be fine.
You got a good heart, just follow your heart.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Don't forget to floss.
I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish.
I'm not being childish! You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone!
I haven't told anyone.
So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser, even though you're not dating him anymore?
She's my best friend.
Well, your best friend has a big fucking mouth.
Take it up with her, then.
Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaw she can keep on talking, as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend.
You had already bought the tickets.
It's just prom, it's not like it matters.
I'm just trying to be friends with you.
It's just humiliating.
I can't do that.
Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else-Thinks-Of-Me.
Fuck anyone else! I care what I think of me, which isn't much right now.
King of the Pity Prom.
Fine. We're not going.
Great.
Why are we even...
I mean, we both knew this was coming.
I'm just the one who did something about it.
Yeah, fucking some college guy.
Fuck you!
I don't regret anything.
Of course you don't.
You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time.
The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.
It's great that you can think that way.
You know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind.
He's not a jock, okay?
He just happens to be on the lacrosse team.
We're all going to other schools next year anyway.
It's not some super-serious relationship.
Great.
I feel so much better now.
We're just having fun.
I bet he's having fun.
Grow up, Mason.
It's not like I haven't been with anyone else.
Who?
What do you care?
Who?
Does it matter?
You're the one who brought it up.
This is pointless.
Now you're just trying to be an asshole.
Holy crap, I would rather have my balls clawed off than ever sit through anything like that ever again.
Well, you never, ever have to.
My God, thank you.
Give me that. Dude, it's all you.
Drink up.
So you coming out with me tonight, brother?
Should be some pretty awesome stuff happening. Naw, dude, I'm going to this show with my dad in Austin.
His friend's playing.
Have fun with that, I guess.
Fuck, there are so many cars here.
I don't wanna go in there!
Dude, you will have so much fun. Your family loves you!
Have a swell time.
Fuck you.
You're coming in with me.
No. Shit, no.
Yes.
Yes, you are.
My mom loves you.
You have to say hi.
Do you want to hurt her feelings?
Well, then, let's go get 'em!
Just for a second.
Just a second, seriously.
You know, you're in sort of enemy territory here.
We're aware.
Look who's here!
Get a job!
Congratulations!
No, no, no! Wait. We're gonna take pictures.
Can you get a camera?
Congratulations, baby.
I don't know you, but congratulations!
All right, look here.
Smile.
Here we go.
That's a good one.
And good.
Got it.
We need...
Sam, where are you?
- Samantha!
- Sam.
And where's Mason Senior?
I'm feeling generous.
Come here.
Great.
And beautiful!
I'll email these to everyone.
Don't even start. Don't start, don't start.
Can't believe you guys came all this way. It means a lot to me.
We wouldn't have missed it for anything!
I'm so proud of you.
Congratulations.
I'm really sorry that Lee couldn't be here.
He's on his senior trip.
No, tell him I said hi. I will.
Abby, I didn't even recognize you.
How old are you now?
I'm 13.
All right, let's top her off.
You want some, doll?
Um, sure, whatever.
Yeah. I got you something.
What is it?
That is a savings bond.
That is worth something. It's better than money. You'd just spend that.
God, is that your mom?
Yeah.
Yeah. That's her. Wow.
Three-second rule.
Put it on your plate.
Such a good dad. Really. I know.
I'm trying to help. Come here, you guys. I want to make a little toast to Mason.
Now, Mason, I know you didn't really want to have a party today, but we did.
And you only graduate high school once in your life.
So I want to celebrate you and this next phase.
And you're gonna learn so much in college, you're gonna have so much fun.
You're gonna have inspiring teachers, you're gonna learn more about your art.
I love you, babe. So proud of you.
- To Mason.
- To Mason. - Here, here!
All right, you're up, kid.
All right...
Well, Mason, I'll make a toast to the future.
To your future.
You know, it's been a little sketchy this end of the school year here, trying to figure out what school to go to.
Mason told me that he wanted to get as far away from home as possible, but still honor our agreement that we pay in-state tuition, which I do appreciate.
He's a prudent man and, he's gonna have a great future.
So here's to you, buddy.
To the future!
Congratulations!
Mason Junior!
High school graduate, 18 and straight!
Just ignore him.
My brother needs to learn to pace himself.
I've not known you as long as everybody here, but since I have known you, you've grown a lot and I'm proud of you.
So, if this photography thing doesn't work out, you know you always got a job. Lose that earring. But...
You know, maybe I can get you front of house. All right.
To you, buddy!
Sam, say something!
Come on, Samantha.
Um... Come on, darling.
Good luck.
So you broke up with your girlfriend?
Yeah, yeah, just recently.
What was her name?
Sheena.
She's gonna go to college with you?
No.
No?
She's staying in this part of Texas.
Okay. You need a ride to college?
I just wanted to say hello before you got out of here.
You guys met before, haven't you?
Annie, Aunt Jen?
Yeah, we met at... Sam's graduation.
Yeah.
And with your little one. Where is he?
He's at home.
Remember?
He was such a pain in Sam's thing that... I would love to see him.
We have a special weekend this weekend, so...
I'm so glad you found her, I really am.
You've got him at a good time, I think.
I think so, too. Yeah. It's good to see you two.
Nice to see you, too, Jen. So proud of your boy.
Yeah.
Yeah, we all are.
She's a bitch and a half.
You got to remember, you're going to college, though, all right?
And if you're anything like me or your old man, you're gonna be pulling down some serious wool. You're gonna be tapping some masterful gap.
You're gonna be doing some good work out there.
Think about it.
Awful lot of flowers in that bouquet.
But you got to do me a favor.
You're going to be vulnerable this summer, all right?
Remember to use protection during breakup sex.
This guy knows exactly of which I speak.
Look what happened to him.
Voila'. Steven.
Cheers.
It's not that simple.
Four more years.
Four more years.
I'm just saying.
Do y'all recycle? Should I...
I have one started there.
Yeah, right.
Am I your only ex at this party?
Yes.
I'm not your only wife here, though.
Yeah.
Can you believe they're both out of high school?
No.
No, I can't.
You did a great job with both of them, by the way.
Thanks for saying that.
I never thought I'd hear you say that.
Well, it's true. Thank you.
You're doing it all over again?
I know, I know, right?
It's gonna be 15 years till I have an empty nest.
But I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could.
I mean, it's so great that you did this.
Can I just give you a little? I'd appreciate it if I could.
Sure.
Yeah.
But I don't have any cash.
I know, it's in Annie's purse. I'll be right back.
So it sucks.
I mean, the guy's a college lacrosse player. What are you gonna do?
She didn't even like sports.
You want a beer?
No, that's all right.
You can have one.
It's okay.
Yeah, well, for what it's worth, we've all been through the exact same thing at one point or another.
It's not the same, though. I mean, you never got to know her.
No, I know, I know. It's not the same.
I just don't know what I did wrong. Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, man.
Hey.
Hey, Mason.
We're up here raiding the green room.
Hope that's okay.
That's totally cool.
All right.
Wow! Is that MJ?
Right?
Unbelievable.
Well, we just decided to come a little early, check you out.
That's cool man, let me finish up.
I'll be up in a minute.
All right. I guarantee you, you didn't do anything wrong.
These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here.
I mean, everybody's just changing so much, you know?
The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are...
Yeah, but still...
Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time.
She wasn't a silly girl, though.
I mean, she's a serious person.
And I really thought we were...
What? I don't know.
Here's the truth.
Women are never satisfied, okay?
They're always looking to potentially trade up, and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you, my fine-feathered friend.
What does that even mean?
It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila.
Sheena.
All right.
It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me, you.
And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door.
Great.
You just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way.
Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter when the front-runner hussies start sniffing around.
So what you're saying is I should take up lacrosse.
Exactly.
Or you could, you know, start a band.
Worked for me a long time ago.
I think it's still working for Jimmy.
Or you just keep taking pictures.
She hated the pictures I took of her.
I'm sick to death of her, okay?
I only met her a few times, and yes, she was cute, all right, but truth be told, I always thought she was a little bit...
You know, a little bit too square for you.
You know, not quite the same vibe.
You really thought that?
On some subtle, lower level.
I mean, I wasn't surprised when it turned out she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?
I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things, you know.
I mean, take your mom and me.
I think I probably turned into the boring, castrated guy she wanted me to be 15, 20 years ago, you know?
I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed, I'm not. I'm just saying that she could've been a little more patient, little more forgiving.
Would've saved me that parade of drunken assholes.
So, what's the point?
Of what?
I don't know, any of this.
Everything.
Everything?
What's the point?
I mean, I sure as shit don't know. Neither does anybody else, okay?
We're all just winging it, you know?
The good news is you're feeling stuff.
And you've got to hold on to that.
You do.
Your skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took, thousands of submissions from all over the state, and you won.
Well, I got silver.
And nine other people did, too.
I'm gonna kill you. I'm trying to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, you know.
Hey, this next one of 'em goes out to a young man in the house.
Whoo-hoo! Known him since he was just a small boy.
Now he's all graduated from high school and making me feel old.
Happy high school graduation, Mason.
Thank you.
Okay, guys, let's be clear.
We're gonna break this into four categories.
One, anything you want to keep from your childhood and you're taking with you.
Two, throwing away.
Three, donating.
And four, whatever you want to try to sell at the garage sale next weekend, whatever we don't sell, we're donating.
Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?
No.
You're missing the point. We're not gonna drag a bunch of crap to Mom's tiny apartment.
Can't believe we're moving again.
No, I'm moving.
You moved two years ago.
You have an apartment in Austin.
Mason is moving in the fall.
I'm done.
This'll be great for me. I'll have all these options.
I could take a sabbatical.
I could get some writing done, try to get published.
What about Christmas, though? What are we gonna do?
I'm not sharing a room with him.
One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress.
How am I supposed to do my laundry?
Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest.
And on your way down, you may magically find some quarters that you use to do laundry in your own apartment.
Come on!
You guys are adults!
You need to take some responsibility.
Now, what do you want?
I'm gonna get the veggie burger.
I'm not having anything, not hungry.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sick.
What is it, your head?
Do you have a fever?
She's pregnant.
To be honest, I drank way too much last night.
You weren't driving, were you?
No, no.
Cary's back home, too, and we just hung out.
You know, peach Smirnoff s, they just go down so easy.
No, no.
Hey, that's not an excuse.
You can still pack boxes.
These people want to move in as soon as possible.
Hi, guys.
I'm Ernesto, how are you?
You probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago.
Yeah.
Believe it or not, you changed my life.
You told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school.
I took your advice.
I signed up for English classes, and then a year later, I went to community college and I got my Associate's degree, and I'm working on my bachelor's now at Texas State.
And also one of the managers here.
That's great.
It's good to see you, because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that.
It really meant a lot to me.
Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do.
You guys should listen to her.
She's a smart lady.
Thank you.
Isn't that kind of crazy, though, that a computer knows who you are from just 20 questions off a form?
I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world.
I mean, there are subsets like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are.
Have you even talked to this guy yet?
No, but we've been trading emails.
He seems pretty cool.
He's studying literature and anthropology and he's way into Bright Eyes, so that's not so bad.
But, anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kinda spooky.
The freshman satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100, just 'cause of the computer.
Well, sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then.
But we pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire 'cause they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost and they'll tell you who your roommate is based on everything you've ever said, written or clicked.
Did you put this in here again?
I don't want it.
Come on, it's the first picture you ever took.
All the more reason to leave it behind, right?
What?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
It's nothing!
Mom.
This is the worst day of my life.
What're you talking about?
I knew this day was coming.
I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving.
I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
What do you expect?
You know what I'm realizing?
My life is just gonna go, like that.
This series of milestones.
Getting married. Having kids.
Getting divorced.
The time that we thought you were dyslexic. When I taught you how to ride a bike.
Getting divorced again.
Getting my master's degree.
Finally getting the job I wanted.
Sending Samantha off to college. Sending you off to college.
You know what's next?
It's my fuckin' funeral!
Just go! And leave my picture!
Aren't you jumping ahead by, like, 40 years or something?
I just thought there would be more.
Hey, you must be Mason.
Yeah.
Dalton, right?
Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.
Definitely.
Are you cool with this side of the room?
Yeah. Got in this morning, just moved my shit in, man.
Well, yeah, I don't care.
No worries. Cool.
Can I help you with anything, man?
Any bags, any of that stuff need brought in?
I just got like one box left, I packed pretty light.
But I appreciate it.
It's my pleasure, man. Of course.
Um... Are you going to the orientation mixer thing?
Orientation mixer thing?
Fuck no, man, I'm not going to that, and neither are you, by the way.
We got way better stuff to be doing, dude.
All right.
You ready?
Yeah.
Hey, Barb, this is my roommate Mason.
Mason, Barb. - Hi.
- Hey.
You coming with us?
Where're you going?
Hiking.
Yeah, man, you should come.
If we leave now we can catch the late afternoon at Big Bend.
You ever been before, man?
Yeah, but not since I was really little.
Then all the more reason to come now, man. That's why we're here, dude.
Mason, this is Nicole, Barb's roommate.
Hey, what's up?
Hi.
Mason, Nicole.
So, you game?
Sure.
Here, have the rest of this.
Got it timed perfectly.
It'll kick in when we get in the mountains.
Awesome.
Let's go.
Do they let you major in that here?
Well, it's not that serious here, so I kinda train outside of university, but I'm taking all my basics like History of Dance and all that.
Nice.
Yeah.
What do you teach?
Gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop. Wow...
Which one's your favorite?
Tap.
Yeah? Yeah.
You get to like make up all your own sounds, and there's no rules.
Just like creative freedom.
That's great.
Yeah. That's why I love teaching it, 'cause,
I don't know, it's so beautiful to me, and it's kind of dying away in this generation, so, to be a part of bringing it back to the kids is really rewarding.
Right, keeps it going.
Yeah.
How old are they? Six to eight.
Wow.
Yeah. They have no fear, and they're not self-conscious at all.
They haven't reached the awkward years yet.
Yeah, not yet.
It's coming.
Hey.
Dalton can be crazy sometimes.
He seems cool, though. Yeah.
Yeah, they're both really cool.
How are you feeling?
Great.
Pretty great, to be honest.
Good.
I'm really happy that you're hangin' out with us.
Yeah.
Me, too.
This moment's having a falsieful whoregasm!
It's like as if all of time has unfolded before us so we could stand here and look out and scream, "Fuck, yeah!"
You know how everyone's always saying, "Seize the moment"?
I don't know, I'm kinda thinking it's the other way around.
You know, like, the moment seizes us.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant.
The moment, it's just...
It's like it's always right now, you know?
Yeah.
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, pal.
Hey, you.
Hi, Dad.
Where are you?
You're not home.
No, I'm at my friend's house.
I'm calling from my phone, so...
How... how is everything?
Good. Good. Things are good.
Just, you know, I'm tired and...
I bet. A lot of work.
A lot of books.
Yeah.
Taste of Chicago, hot delivery.
Uh, want a bite?
You want a bite. - Oh, my God.
- One little bite.
I miss that place so much.
Stop, stop.
I'm picking you up from the airport.
We're going right there when you come in the weekend.
Awesome.
Good, bad, what? They were fine.
Nothing too intense. But, um... It was... it was good.
What's the matter?
No, what?
What do you mean?
Oh, nothing, I... I, um, just a little, uh... you seem a little down.
I don't know, maybe I'm getting the flu or something.
- I don't know.
- What the fuck are you doing?
I...
I gotta go. I...
I have an exam tomorrow, and, um, I should go.
Okay.
Yeah, I don't want to keep you from studying.
Dad...
I... I can't wait for next weekend.
Me, too.
Miss you.
I miss you.
Take care.
Bye.
What?
Yeah?
Hey, uh, who's...
Wh-who's this?
Who's this?
You're the one calling me.
I'm, uh, Beth's father. I'm looking for Beth.
Is she there?
Shit, this ain't even my phone.
Hi, you've reached Beth.
You know what to do.
Hey, Beth, it's dad. Um...
I just called your phone, and, uh, I don't know, some guy answered it.
He didn't seem to know who you were, so I wond... I... did you lose your phone or something?
But, uh, if you did, you're probably not getting this. Anyway, uh, give me a call.
Also, yeah, I got a, uh...
a notice from school about something, but I'll... you know, we'll talk about it, um...
Just call me. All right, bye-bye.
Hey, it's Dad.
Just calling again.
Don't want to bother you, just, um... I don't know, just give me a call. Thanks.
Westwood Palms.
Yes, this is Paul Brennan.
Uh, my daughter is Beth Brennan.
I called earlier and I talked to a, uh... a Justin.
Uh, he was gonna go check on her. Um, I've been trying to call. There's no answer.
Doesn't look like anybody's been there for a while.
Okay.
Thank you.
- There you go. - Okay.
Let me, uh... let me ask you something.
You see either of these... Two girls here tonight?
Couldn't tell you, man.
After a while, they all look the same.
Okay.
Excuse me, uh, I'm wondering if you could help me for a second.
Whatcha drinking'?
No, no, I just, uh...
I-I-I'm looking for my daughter...
In the stripes.
Well, like the sign says, you want a beer or a shot of whisky?
No, no, I just... Have you seen either of these girls here tonight?
All right, here it is.
It's gonna be $4.00.
How 'bout this?
You just take this 20, look at the picture, and give me an answer.
Sorry, buddy, haven't seen either of them tonight. Good luck with that.
Can I have a water, please?
Water.
Thank you.
Here you go. Thank you.
And I won't have to lose it.
Don't be aggressive.
- Go to the next bar.
- Yeah. Let's go.
That'd be nice.
Excuse me.
Miss, I'm...
I'm Beth's father.
- Really?
- Nick, uh, it's okay.
Where'd you get this?
From her apartment, which I've been calling for a week, and there's no answer, so I'm just wondering...
Oh, so you've been going though her stuff.
I don't know where she is.
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this place sucks. - Yeah.
Let me ask you one thing... - Hey, wait!
- Hey!
Let go of her, asshole! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
That's enough!
That's enough.
Everybody...
Hey, hey!
Come on! Can you help me?
Just five minutes.
That's all.
Uh, hey, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna meet up with you later.
This is such bullshit.
- I said I'll meet up with you later.
- Whatever.
Uhh.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Just a few questions.
I already told you, I don't know where she is.
You're her friend, right?
Five minutes.
Give me five minutes.
I'm hungry.
So you haven't heard from her.
People change. We're in college.
We have lots of distractions.
It's real...
I understand that, I understand that.
It's just I don't know where she is.
That's never been the case before. You're her friend, you're telling me you don't know where she is.
So... any help you can give me.
I'm not a bad person.
Okay, I do what any other person my age does.
I like to go out. I like to party.
I like to have a good time. I work hard.
Beth? She doesn't go to school anymore.
She... is doing shit that I'm not into.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
You do know, you said... what does that mean?
So, a month ago, we went to New Orleans, and ended up meeting this guy named Eddie.
Thinks he's this bad-ass because he's got drugs everywhere, and everyone here probably knows him, 'cause they go to him to get some shit.
But... she fell for it and fell for him.
She said she was gonna go down last week and that she'd be back Sunday, and I haven't heard from her.
- Do you know this guy?
- Everybody knows this guy.
Yeah, but do you... do you know where he works?
Do you know where he lives? Do you know where he deals? Any of those things?
I told you, New Orleans. Are you not listening?
New Orleans is a big city.
Do you know where you can find him?
I'm... yeah. I know people that know him.
Can you drive me down there right now?
I'll give you some money.
Um, I don't know if you can tell I'm really drunk.
- I'll drive your car.
- I cannot drive. I'll give you $500.
We drive down. Just point out where he lives.
It doesn't matter, whenever we get there.
You can go right back. - That's all I'm asking.
- Wait, can you just go back a second?
- You'll...
- Did you say $500?
Yeah.
- Are you messing with me?
- No.
- I mean, it's the middle of the night.
- Now.
Thank you.
Check!
Can I ask you something?
- Yeah. - If you're so worried about Beth, why wouldn't you just call the cops?
Because they wouldn't even do anything for 48 hours... Unless I reported her missing.
And even then, they're not gonna give it any priority.
Which she kind of has, if you think about it.
Not the Beth I know.
How many Beths do you think there are?
One.
You know what I think?
I think this whole thing's your fault.
You're the stereotype. You're like one of those hard-ass parents that... Just doesn't get it.
It's like the more you keep someone from doing something, they more they want to try it.
So, uh, your suggestion is that I... I should encourage her more to get drunk and stoned and maybe participate in that.
Is that what your dad did?
No, that is not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is that you should just let her be a teenager.
You know, it's natural to experience things.
And, from what I heard, you kept her on lockdown and you barely let her out of the house.
What'd you expect? Is that what she said? Come on.
Uhh!
Come on, you can't keep a kid locked up, because then they finally get out there in the real world, and they start experiencing all the shit that they've been missing, and then they go crazy.
You know, it's like they're trying to make up for lost time.
You are so annoying.
You think this Eddie character will be in there?
It's where we met him.
When we get in there, I want you to keep a little distance from me.
In this city, it's gonna be better off for you if people don't realize we're together.
What are you talking about?
Just trust me on that.
So I'm just gonna go find a quiet little corner to sit in.
Spend a few minutes out here, and then follow me and...
Just do whatever you normally do.
You see this Eddie guy, just let me know somehow.
Just... try and tell me about it, but don't be real obvious, okay?
Okay.
Beth?
You wanna dance?
Is he here?
Come on.
I swear, no one will know we're together.
Just some creepy old man and his young girl. Easy.
Mmm.
Is he here?
No.
What do you want?
I'm just trying to have some fun.
Oh, I feel so good right now.
You should try it sometime.
I know a place we could go.
Like this?
Mm... yeah. It's like the only place that's open.
- Would you slow down, man?
- How far away is this place?
I don't know, it's like right down the strip.
- Like 10 or 15 minutes. - Come on, please.
Let's go.
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you see that guy in the camo vest?
- Come on, bring the girls, dude. - That him?
No, but I've seen them hang out a lot. - All right, cool.
- Wait here. Hey, man, right up here.
I'm there. Hey...
I'm, uh, looking for Eddie.
Do I know you? Just tell me where he is, I...
I have something for him.
If you did, you'd know where to find him.
- Not until you tell me where he is.
- You just fucked yourself, buddy.
Get him!
Back off!
If I ever see you here again, you're a dead man.
Crazy motherfucker.
You're not going anywhere.
Fine by me.
We can do this all day long for all I care.
Holy shit, what was that?
Are you okay?
Find his number.
Find his number. Send him a text, ask him where he is.
Well, what if I don't hear back from him for hours?
That's why you need me.
Wait, wait a minute.
What the fuck was that?
Seriously!
What the fuck just happened?
Can you take me home?
I wanna go home.
We're going to a place right up here where you can crash for a bit.
You gotta come down.
Okay, on a scale of one to 10... 10 being, I don't know, the Sistine chapel, and one being a steaming pile of shit... how nice are we talking?
That's like...
that's like two steps away from shit!
Can you walk?
Seriously, are we staying here?
Oh my... you know, there's places that aren't too expensive that actually wash their sheets, right? Not today.
We're here.
I know people. I can get us a room somewhere.
Oh, I'm sure you do. We have a room.
Okay, now that we're all settled in, - do you want to tell me what's going on?
- We're getting some sleep.
That's not what I'm talking about.
You don't go to the cops. You don't want to be seen together. You take me to this shit hole in the middle of nowhere.
I need some answers.
You're in no condition to have any answers right now.
- Let's just get some sleep.
- It's fine.
I'm just tired.
Thank you, Beth's dad.
Ohh, can you just drive me home, please?
I can't believe I got myself into this shit.
Oh, my God. I have the worst headache ever. This is ridiculous.
I'm just so tired.
Will you drive me home?
This is not what I signed up for.
I don't know why you won't let me just, like, text the guy.
I go and I party there all the time.
Like, we could stay in a really nice place... clean beds and hot showers and...
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
Beth's dad.
Did this hurt?
Yes.
Does it still hurt?
A bit.
How did she die?
Leukemia.
Beth never really talked about it.
She mentioned you.
She missed you.
Well, I bet you helped her with that homesickness, huh?
Introduced her to all the right people?
Like the ones who'll give you a line of blow for a favor in the most convenient bathroom stall?
I bring my own to the party.
Oh.
Is that him?
Yeah.
He's at some bar called Excite.
He's sitting at a table on the second floor.
You can't miss him... he's sandwiched between two girls.
What's this?
It's not enough?
You want me to leave?
We had an arrangement.
What about Beth?
I didn't come all this way to not know.
I need you to leave.
Ohh, fuck!
Black jack, Mr. Riley?
Yeah, that's good, Carl. Thanks.
Anything else I can get you?
No, that's good.
Leave the bottle.
Son of a bitch.
Carl...
Bring another glass.
You got it, boss.
Do you mind if I take a seat?
Excuse me?
Mind if I sit down?
Who the fuck are you?
I'm looking for my daughter.
Her name is Beth. Beth Brennan.
Sorry, man. Never heard of her.
But, uh, there is a club across the street, and she's probably spinning around on a pole right now.
So fuck off.
Ladies, please excuse us for a moment.
They're not going anywhere.
Only one that's leaving is you.
Seriously.
Who does this fuckin' guy think he is?
I have no interest whatsoever in what your business is.
I don't even care how you know my daughter.
In fact, the less we know about each other, the better off you're gonna be.
But I wanna know, and I need to know, where she is now.
And neither of us are leaving this table until you tell me.
Is that a fact?
Hey, why don't you girls, uh...
take off, huh?
- What the fuck, man?
- Shut up, Eddie.
Come on, let's go!
I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive my young friend here.
You know how kids are these days.
Just spouting off, shooting off their mouth when they don't know shit.
He's not a bad kid.
He's a good kid, basically, and I'd like to see him live a little longer.
You don't recognize me, do you?
No, I can't say I do.
I was at Stuart's the night you took down seven people.
I'd never seen anything like it.
There was guns firing all over the place.
Every time we'd shoot, we'd miss, like you made out of... air or something. Like a ghost.
And then the bodies started hitting the ground.
Seven of them, falling all around me.
I fell, too, but I wasn't hit. Not yet.
You don't remember this?
You started walking across the room to me, stepping over the bodies, coming right for me, like you could...
Smell that there was still somebody alive in the room. You put your gun right up to my head.
I waited for you to pull the trigger.
Closed my eyes. That gunshot never came.
By the time I had the guts to open my eyes, you were long gone.
Well... I used to drink back then.
Well, maybe you let me live so that, 20 years later, we'd be sitting in a bar, and I could tell my nephew to tell you whatever you wanna know.
I don't know where she is, man, I swear.
We went out a few times. She started getting into harder stuff... heroin... but I don't do that shit.
It's not what I do.
Where is she?
Last I knew, she was with The Pharmacy.
You left her at a pharmacy?
The Pharmacy is a scumbag drug dealer named Tony Martinez.
Yeah, he works out of a warehouse on the east side.
Where?
23rd and Atlantic.
I'd appreciate... That you don't talk about this conversation.
You have my word.
Oh... Stuart's... I ran out of ammo.
Oh, that guy gives me the creeps, man.
Beth's my friend, all right?
I'm not just gonna get in the car and turn around.
What part didn't you understand about?
Aren't you glad I'm here?
- What would you have done? I'm driving.
Move over.
Come on. Let's go.
Remind me again who this guy is.
Former boxer, been talking behind your back. Making himself appear like... Somebody connected to you.
I heard local vice has taken a vested interest in him.
Okay.
Donny Musical.
How could you forget that name?
Everybody says you're a real punk.
Now you've been making problems for me... My family.
My family and my friends, you make promises you can't keep.
Down here... You can't get away with that shit.
Don't say anything just yet.
You can do all this bullshit posturing in L.A. and New York, but you can't do it down here.
Not in my city.
You think that's gonna impress anybody?
Donny... nothing is more important than your name.
You cheated me... you went behind my back and took something that didn't belong to you, Donny.
I'm not gonna forgive you.
Only God forgives.
Bye-bye, Donny. Uhh!
It's definitely him.
It's been 20 years since he's been seen in the city.
How can you be so sure?
O'Reilly took special interest as soon as he walked in the door.
You bring him to me.
Now, do you understand?
We're tailing him now.
Boss, I know you don't want to hear this, but you pay me a lot of money to give you honest counsel.
Let this one go.
Let what go?
What are you talking about?
Think I can let it go?
You get some people... now.
The best people you can get.
If The Prince is here...
Bring him to me.
Get up as close to him as you can.
So, Beth's dad...
Where are we going?
I'm taking you home.
You're gonna go to the train station...
- I don't... - ...'Cause that's best for everybody.
I don't want to go.
I am not going.
Pull over!
You're okay.
Stay down.
Stay in the car.
Who you working for?
Fuck you.
Who you working for?
Who fuckin' sent you?
- Open up, open up!
- No. No. There you go.
Who... sent you?
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' eyes out right now. Who sent you?
Omar.
Omar.
Well, you tell fuckin' Omar that I'm passing through, and he better fuckin' let me pass through.
You remember that?
Wilson's dead.
Joe's in the hospital, but it doesn't look like he's gonna make it.
I told you to put your best people on it.
We can do that, but we don't have much to go on.
The guys at the bar aren't talking.
He's here looking for a girl, an addict.
That's all we know.
I don't care what it takes.
I feel like I would be remiss... If I did not reiterate my position.
Your position?
People that have limbs that are amputated still feel the pain in that limb, even though it's not there.
That's the pain that I feel. Every time I look, I mean...
I see his face. I feel that pain, and I see him looking back at me.
We have a chance to get him. Right now.
Let's go get him.
Just take a breath. You're gonna be okay.
How the fuck am I supposed to be okay? I just...
Just watched you kill someone.
One second, I'm at a college party.
The next second, I'm in New Orleans, getting shot at.
I need some answers!
Why are they after you?
Why?
- What do you want?
- Who are they? What do you have in here? What do you want?
- What do you want? - I don't want anything!
You want some pills?
You want some pot?
- Want some booze? - No, I want the truth!
- Want some pot? What do you want? - Look at me!
You owe this to me!
- Will you be quiet?
- No, I want the truth.
Why are there a bunch of men after a fucking mechanic from Mississippi?
What do they want with you?
Who are you?
I'm not a mechanic from Mississippi.
I was born two blocks from here.
You can see the shitty little smokestack and the tenement.
I wasn't a mechanic, I was just a piece of shit running the streets.
And I got in a situation where I could go to jail or I can go to the military, so, obviously, I took the military.
After months, lots and lots of enemies here.
And I was good.
Why are they after us now?
Because I went and I came back, and you come back to what?
I come back to this.
And so I had one opportunity, I thought, that would get me out, and of course I took it.
And, of course, I took the next one after that, and the next one and the next one, and I was what I always was, which is nothing and a liar.
What do they want with you?
I did something 20 years ago for these...
For what?
What?
What?
He was, uh, trying to take over the city, and it didn't matter who he eliminated.
And there were lots. Lots.
The violence got to a point where, uh, he needed to be stopped. At the end of the day, you know who's gonna be here?
- He needed to be stopped. - You, Daddy.
I love you.
Are you okay?
Mm, yeah, kind of.
I miss you. Come here.
Mm... daddy's girl.
Come here.
Go run over to mommy, yeah?
- Okay.
- Oh, hey!
Look what I have.
What do you have?
This is a present for you on the first day of school, puppy.
- Thank you.
- Don't open it till you get to class.
Ohh.
Come on, silly, we don't want to be late.
- Oh, she won't be late. - Bye, Daddy.
Bye, baby.
Oh, I'm taking your car, okay?
All right.
All right.
Rachel, wait, wait, wait, wait. I wanna get a picture of you guys.
Cheese!
I love you.
I love you.
Bye, honey.
Have fun at school.
Here you go.
And I tried to stop it, but it was too late.
It was too late to... it was too late for me.
And I'll never forget the look in her eyes.
Not that I deserve pity for that.
'Cause I don't.
It's just a fact.
So it drove me out of here, and I left everything.
And woke up somewhere. I don't know where. Fucking in a bottle.
And that's where Anna Marie came in and lifted me up. Stupidly loved me...
And 12-stepped me to the altar.
And Beth was an accident.
A happy accident. A blessed accident. But I can't have it.
What am I gonna do with a child?
I can nurture a child with my tools?
They're gonna kill Beth if I don't get to her first.
What?
They're gonna try to kill me, and they'll kill you.
So I need you to listen to me and I need you to trust me.
You don't have to like me.
You understand?
Mm-hmm. And I will get you out of here.
I really appreciate that.
Thank you.
Where are we going?
I'm gonna drop you off with a friend, somewhere you're gonna be safe for a while.
I'll get you when I get Beth back.
Okay, you're leaving me where, exactly?
I'll bring you back when I get Beth.
It's someone I trust.
Wait a minute. What are you doing?
Oh, we're stealing a car?
I'm here for Sam.
They're on the way up.
Jesus Christ.
Good to see you.
Come on in.
How you been?
I don't know.
Wow. This is impressive.
Yeah.
Really.
What do you want, Paul?
I gotta get my daughter. - Your what?
- My daughter.
She's gone, I've come here to get her.
She's fallen into some bad stuff.
Fallen into what?
Some guy named "The Pharmacy."
Oh, fuck. - You know him?
- Yeah.
He's a lunatic.
Can you help me?
Can't do that.
I don't do that stuff anymore, Paul.
Nothing personal.
You don't have to leave this room.
I will take care of him.
I will take care of him.
What are you asking me to do?
I just want some time, a safe place for Angela to stay here, give me some time to get Beth, and then I need a safe ride out of here. Clean.
- Beth's your daughter?
- Yes.
- That's Angela?
- That's right.
Nobody gets hurt? Clean.
Shit.
Jesus.
You know what'll happen if the word gets out that I'm with you again?
Right?
You know.
I do, yeah. I do.
So if I do this thing, I'm not gonna see you... Around town anymore, right?
You're not gonna come back?
You're not gonna see me anywhere, ever again, friend.
How's your shoulder?
I'm a righty now. Crazy motherfucker.
Be careful out there.
A lot of the old faces you knew...
Can't trust them anymore.
I never did, Sam.
We'll wait here, then.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Come on in.
You want something to drink?
You want something to eat?
Uh, a drink's great, yeah.
What do you want?
You... we got everything.
Do you have whisky?
I'll get you whisky.
That your boyfriend?
No. He's my friend's dad.
So are you gonna send anyone to help him?
No. I'm not gonna send anybody. - Thank you.
- He doesn't need any help.
You really don't know who he is, huh?
Not really.
You know where South Garriston is?
- No.
- No? Garriston Street.
Old timers called it Hadrian's Wall.
Oh, I don't know what that is.
When Rome was at the peak of its powers...
You know, it ran most of the world, right? Ran everything, except in Scotland.
There was this... tribe.
They were so fuckin' crazy... That, even at the peak of its powers, it just wasn't worth it for the Romans to go in there.
So this emperor, Hadrian, built a wall across Scotland. And he just walled 'em up.
Gave 'em a... kingdom for themselves.
South Garriston was Paul's territory.
His own little kingdom, where he could do whatever the fuck he wanted.
And nobody ever dared go in there.
You wouldn't even know his name. Just called him "The Prince."
"The Prince"?
You better get away from him.
How may I help you?
Looking for Big Mike.
Um, uh... My Daddy passed a couple years back.
How can I be of service to you?
My condolences. Sorry to hear about your old man.
However, I left something here a while back and I need to pick it up now.
Oh, yeah.
Let's see.
I don't give a shit how fast you think you are. At this range... I ain't gonna miss.
You better be sure about that.
Now, before my daddy passed... He told me three things:
Never put 10 pounds of shit in a five-pound bag, never take credit when they got cash in hand, and if a man walks through that door with tattoos like you've got on your hand,
"son, you better be ready to draw.
'Cause that man... that man brings hell with him wherever he goes."
Big Mike helped me escape this city 20 years ago. Gave me a new name, a new identity.
I left him something.
We had an agreement.
I'm here to pick that up. I am going to pick that up.
He was my friend.
Is that so?
Jameson, one ice cube, one maraschino cherry.
My daddy did have a sweet tooth.
Uh, sorry about this, but you can never be too safe around here.
What you're lookin' for, it's in the back.
This is what you're looking for, huh?
Looks like the flood got a hold of this.
Oh, boy.
I could, uh, I could clean 'em up for you. Put some oil on 'em.
I don't think the coil broke on any of 'em.
Probably take me a couple days.
I don't have time.
My daddy didn't have many friends.
So...
You can choose one of these.
Consider it a gift from Big Mike.
Only untraceable weapons this side of communist California.
I'm gonna need Mercury-tipped bullets.
I got black talons, plus Ps, hollow points.
How many you gonna need?
How many you got?
What's up?
What are you doing?
Huh? I'm here to see Tony.
Oh, you must have your addresses mixed up, because there ain't no Tony here.
Look, don't waste my fuckin' time.
Tony's your boss, The Pharmacy. I got some information for him.
- You got an appointment?
- No.
But he does.
What's that supposed to mean?
Means if I'm not speaking to him in the next two minutes, he's gonna find himself dead... And we'll throw you in with the deal.
You'll take that, shy hero?
Okay, handsome.
Get those arms up.
Get 'em up, get 'em up.
Hmm? What's this?
What do you got here, hmm?
What does it look like?
Tough neighborhood. Bet your ass it is, old man.
You can it back on the way out.
Yeah, I will.
Get your ass in there.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm bringing him now.
Come on!
What's wrong with you, man?
This the guy?
That's him.
Take a seat.
No. I won't be staying long.
Whatever makes you feel happy, pop.
Jimmy tells me you got some information for me. Some sort of tip... That's gonna save my life.
Matter of fact, I do.
Lay it on me.
It's about the girl that you've been living with.
- I live with a lot of girls.
- Well, that's good.
Her name is Beth,
Beth Brennan, my daughter.
And she's leaving with me tonight.
Why are we talking about bitches, anyway?
I thought this was a life-and-death situation.
It is... for you... If you don't let me take her out of here now.
You got this all fucked up, pops.
All wrong.
You see... this ain't no prison cell.
Especially your little girl.
I mean, she wanted to be here so bad, she actually begged me to stay.
Shit, you can look for yourself.
She's still doing a little recuperating.
You know, I ain't did nothing to her that she didn't ask me to do.
You know how these kids are these days.
They get a little taste of partying and drugs, and they just want more and more and more.
Gotta have it.
Well... You best be the motherfucker that obliges by keeping your ass on that fuckin' couch while I walk out of here with her right now, 'cause you won't be breathing, otherwise.
Okay, that... that...
that's not possible.
You see, I got a call from my man. Omar.
Yeah, that's right.
He told me you'd show up. Said to keep you here on ice till he gets here.
And the girl. Because he got something special planned for your baby girl.
Close your eyes, baby.
There we go. Hold on.
Keep your eyes closed.
Don't open your eyes.
Don't open your eyes.
No, no, we didn't do anything!
I swear, I swear!
We told you to keep them on ice.
Where are they?
They're gone.
They're gone.
Look at that.
You got the 12-year.
Yeah.
A celebration here.
You ready?
Yeah, hold on.
You don't want to waste the good stuff on a bad shot.
How long till you can get us out of here?
I'm working on it.
How soon?
I'll handle it.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Is word out yet?
Everybody knows you're back.
I knew that'd happen.
Glad it worked out.
We've got him.
A man with a bullet wound showed up this morning at the battle house.
He had a girl with him who looked pretty strung out.
Makes sense they would go to Sam's for sanctuary.
Let everybody know.
Do not cross my line.
Hey.
Hi.
You look pretty.
You look like shit.
How are you feeling?
She threw up again, so she should be feeling better.
It's gonna get worse.
Okay, well, I'm gonna go get a soda.
- Do you want anything?
- No. But I need you to get her ready to travel.
We have to leave. Okay?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Hey, you.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I know you are.
Just gonna get you home, okay? I...
I don't think I can go.
Of course you can.
Everything's changed.
Not with me, it hasn't.
You're the only reason I keep going, Beth.
I don't know what home is anymore.
We'll find it.
We'll find it.
Switch them around.
Just you with me.
I'll see you soon, okay?
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
I really wish you guys were coming with me.
I can't protect you both.
I understand.
Well, will you call me when you get home safely?
Yeah. Don't be too hard on her.
I won't.
Come on, guys.
Wait on the corner for the tail.
That's high cotton, blood.
Jesus Christ.
My heart's pounding.
That Montecristo's not helping, is it?
No.
It's the adrenaline.
Yeah.
It's the only thing I miss.
Nobody makes it through.
Copy that.
Remember that third street tavern?
Remember that fuckin' clusterfuck?
You got your shoulder all shot up.
Jesus Christ, were we shit-faced.
I don't know how we stumbled out of there and lived.
Do you think it was money, Sam?
Is that what it was all about?
That's what we thought, right?
Move in.
Copy.
Get her out of here, come on!
"Nobody gets hurt."
You motherfucker.
Get in.
Just keep 'em off as long as you can.
Keep 'em off.
I got a daughter of my own.
Whatever you need... It's yours.
All right.
Close the door on your way out.
Please, I just... I just wanna go home.
Where's home?
Ponto... Pontotoc.
- What?
- Pontotoc.
What's Pontotoc?
Pontotoc, Mississippi.
I used to work with your father.
We knew each other.
What?
He took everything from me.
Your father did.
Everything.
But you and I can ask him why...
When he comes here... to see you.
And you and I are just gonna sit here and wait for him till he gets here.
Why?
Baby... stop the scratching.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please just let me go home.
Listen to me... when we get there, it'll be 11 minutes before a response team shows up. So if we're not out that door by then, you have to go.
You get in your car and you drive and you don't look back.
- You don't come back.
- Okay.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Is that okay?
Yep.
He's here.
Hey.
Hey.
Let's go, come on. Come on, get up.
We gotta go.
Say, "Hi, Daddy.
I'm a little scared."
Daddy.
Daddy.
- Louder. - Daddy.
"Daddy"!
- Yeah.
- Daddy!
That's right! "Daddy"! Is this what you want?
- No!
- Is this enough? ! Let her go and I'll let you walk away.
You'll never see me again.
That's enough anymore!
You want me?
You take me. I want you to know what it's like to lose the only thing that you ever loved in your life.
You ready?
You chose this life, we chose this life, and that's the cost.
What about my wife and child?
! What did they have to do with it?
What?
!
Please don't! Collateral damage. It was a war.
And you... Are gonna lose the only thing that you ever loved in your life.
Say bye.
Tell him you love him. Tell him you love him.
- No, don't...
- Tell him!
- Please don't!
- Say it!
Say, "I love you, Daddy"!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
No... please...
Having a good time. Good time.
Shh, shh, shh. Quiet now.
See him?
See him?
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, all right, all right.
Good girl. Good girl. You're very brave.
See him?
There he is.
Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
Say hi.
One...
Two...
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
Shoot now.
Shoot now.
Let's go home.
Yes.
I'm not kidding.
That's where this "class act" brought me.
Yeah, you heard me. Hooters.
This is the first date I've been on since the divorce and the guy brings me to a Hooters.
Is Tyler asleep?
Yeah! Whoo!
- Not all the way.
- What's he doing?
This T-shirt's on fire!
Why is he singing that?
Must save planet Earth.
No, It's all good.
- It's out.
- What's out?
God, I'm coming home.
Intruder alert.
Yeah, maybe that's not actually a bad idea.
Okay, here's the plan:
You're gonna call me in 10 minutes so that I can tell this dope I have an emergency.
Can you give me my bath now?
Make it five minutes.
Got you, Buffalo shrimp with the sauce on the side.
They'll do that for me here.
I didn't know how you took it so...
You realize that you're not actually looking at my face right now.
Very tight game going on there.
I don't wanna miss it.
You gotta really swing the ax hard to get those, hits in deep.
- Hi, Jim. - Hey, Jim.
Cheese sticks in the shape of a heart.
From me, Bunny, Bethany and Britney.
Thank you, Bubbles.
That's very nice.
- Have fun. - See you.
All right.
Hey, I noticed that you made eye contact with Boobies but I'm not sure it was her eyes you were looking at.
So you organize closets for a living.
Yes.
Is it hard to find people who can't organize their own closets?
How does that work?
Well, it's not that they can't do it for themselves. It's that they don't have the time or they don't do it efficiently.
Did you start with organizing glove compartments and just work your way up from there or...?
Listen, I'm sorry.
I know this is not going well.
I haven't been on a date in 20 years.
I haven't been on a date since senior year.
You get married in college?
- Yep.
- Me too.
- Really?
- Yes.
Is this not the weirdest feeling in the world right now?
Like Weird Al starring in Weird Science.
Yes. I like that. You just came up with that?
Yes.
Very good.
You know, I think I will have one of these Buffalo shrimp.
And I'll have it with the sauce.
Excellent.
My God.
- It's hot.
- My God. Who makes sauce this hot? I just...
Did you drink my beer?
No. No, no. I think you did.
Boobies!
Buddy!
Britney!
- Can you get me some water?
- Here. Have some French onion soup.
You know, I'm curious.
With so many possible reasons which one's the one your wife left you for?
Cancer.
I'm sorry.
I naturally just assumed you were divorced.
It's okay.
I naturally assumed your husband shot himself.
So we're even.
I gotta take this.
Hello.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down!
An avalanche in our backyard?
I'll be home right away.
It's an emergency. I'm sorry.
Twenty dollars should cover my half.
He used the emergency excuse on you?
Like he's the one that had to escape.
Like I'm so horrible.
Well, everybody has a bad blind-date story and this loser is yours.
Who set you up?
One of the mothers in Tyler's class.
Every time I see her she tells me about her "friend Jim."
And, "I just have to meet Jim."
Well, she's a liar and an idiot.
You should roofie her and shave her head.
Dick?
Hi.
- No, I can talk. I'm just at work.
- Great.
I know. I'm so sore.
I L word you too.
Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.
Did you just use the L word with Dick?
We said it last night.
Jen! That's great! Why didn't you tell me?
Well, you know. You finally went on a date and it was so awful.
I didn't want to make you feel lonelier than you probably already feel.
I'm fine, actually. And I'm not lonely.
I have two wonderful men in my life:
Brendan and Tyler.
Brendan needs a girlfriend and Tyler needs Ritalin.
You're suggesting sex and drugs as a remedy for my children's behavior.
My God. this is the dress I've been wanting forever.
What?
No.
- Who has that kind of money?
- Dick.
Try this on.
This is a total MILF dress.
We don't try on the clients' clothes.
It's one of our selling points.
"We won't wear your underwear while we're organizing your closets."
I'm just saying.
Back to work.
I think right at the bottom of this rack, we could fit some more shoes and storage...
Jen!
Kanye, come and change the baby.
North is wet and I don't wanna drop her on camera again.
Okay. Take it off.
No!
Look, this whole rack still has the price tags on.
Technically, she hasn't taken ownership yet.
And besides, she's at the tennis club.
Now, try this on.
This dress can change a woman from the kind a man cheats on to the kind a man cheats with.
I'm gonna go pee.
Expensive. Expensive.
Ooh, most expensive.
Wow. I didn't know you were gonna look that good in it.
Honey, what's wrong?
I should have tried harder.
I should have dressed sexier.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Mark is a pig.
But the kids don't know that.
They just...
They want us to get back together.
And I don't know how to explain it to them.
Well, it's time for them to learn that their dad is a big pile of crap.
I get so depressed I need to wear high, sexy heels.
- Stop jogging.
- It helps.
It's freaking me out.
Look at me. I'm ridiculous.
Come here. Come here.
- Jen's got you.
- Now I see why they call you "Closet Queens."
- Instagram.
- Facebook.
- Yes! - Yes!
It was awful, man.
There was no connection at all.
I was so happy when you came up with the avalanche thing.
- That saved my life. - Ha-ha-ha.
And the way she dressed was like an assistant principal or something.
I felt like I was in detention.
- I got a girl for you.
- Yeah?
Blond lady. From my belly-dancing class.
A little bit on the plus size.
But when she gets to moving, all that flapping can make it happen.
- That big girl would hit that Hooters like a hurricane.
Chicken.
Steak. Fries. And a Diet Coke.
- All right! Gotcha! - Ha-ha-ha.
I'm out, man. No more dating for me.
It's time and money I should be spending with my kids.
Look who it is.
Hey, Larry!
My all-star!
Give me some.
It's Hilary, Dad, which is bad enough.
You gonna leave me hanging?
Boom.
Guess what?
The new Kodiak tents just arrived.
In time for spring break.
We're going camping in our back yard again this year?
Why?
It's just some kids in my class are going to Florida or to Colorado or even Switzerland.
You got a lot of rich kids in your school.
- We don't got that kind of money.
- I know. It'd just be nice to go someplace.
You know where you could take her that's cheap?
My belly-dancing class.
Put that away. Seriously.
Excuse me, sir? I'm here to pick up my basketball uniform.
Did you just call me "sir"?
- Yeah.
- I'm a girl.
That's one fugly girl.
Hey, man, that's his daughter.
Hey, honey, how's the math homework coming?
Are any of the tutor's shortcuts helping?
Did you go on a date?
A date?
Who told you I went on a date?
You should really change your e-mail password, little Miss 072099.
That is the last time I use your birthday as a password.
I can't believe you read my e-mails.
Brendan, I love you but we have to learn to respect each other's privacy in this house.
Who's Jim?
Nobody, honey.
A buffoon.
Trust me. It was nothing.
- You promise?
- Promise.
Hey! No wheels in the house!
- I've told you this! - Aah!
Tackle him, Mom!
Get him!
Did your dad take you for ice cream on the way home?
- Spank him!
- Rocky Road and mint chocolate chip!
- Take him to the ground!
- I'm on top of the world! Goose, goose!
- Yeah. - You're dead!
No more titty twisters, guys!
You only have two titties for the rest of your lives!
We need to learn to love and respect them.
I always did.
How many times have I told you not to pump him full of sugar before you drop him off?
Come on. Going out with Dad for an ice cream cone is a lasting memory for a kid.
Okay. Well, if Dad spent more time with him then the memories wouldn't have to be so "lasting."
Boom, zing. Got me again.
It's so great spending time with you, Lauren.
That doesn't go there.
What are we gonna do?
It's gonna explode in 3, 2...
Thank God.
That was close.
It was almost unorganized for a minute.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Good.
Are you going to Tyler's game on Saturday?
- Yes! Of course!
- Great. I'm putting you down.
It's what you do best.
On the board, Mark. On the board.
Lauren, the boys don't need a board. They don't need a list.
The know they can count on me. That's it.
Dad, can you help me with my homework?
I can't, bud! Sorry!
I gotta go to a thing!
Ask your mom!
This is not an example of my behavior.
Did you leave?
My innocence is wearin' thin
- Larry, wanna shoot some hoops?
- Dad!
Stop! Get out!
Why wouldn't you knock?
I'm sorry, honey!
I didn't see anything!
Thanks a lot!
No, no, no!
There was plenty of stuff to see!
I mean, I didn't see any gelling going on!
- How about a fist bump?
- No!
Larry, we both need this fist bump.
We're cool.
Hey, how we doing in here?
I'm talking to Mom.
Great. What are you guys talking about?
It's girl stuff.
Okay. Well, just so you know, I'm pretty good with girl stuff too.
Excuse me for a second.
Thanks, Dad.
But I just wanna talk to Mom.
Sure, sure.
Say hi for me.
I'm all out of stickers.
You're all out of face.
What happened to you?
Can I play with Espn now?
Espn is having her quiet time.
With Invincible Mommy?
"Invisible." Yes.
It's not fair only Espn gets to see her.
I know.
I wish I could see her.
Me too.
Come here.
Mac and cheese?
- Mac and cheese.
- Yeah!
I mean, he's looking around here. Looking for you.
You knew it was today.
I published the calendar.
Laur, the meeting went longer than expected.
What do you want from me?
You know what? I just want you to be a dad!
I can't take it!
Why don't you hop over to the snack bar, see if they sell any chill pills.
"Chill pills"?
Why don't you "bust a move" back to 1990.
You're at a baseball game?
I'm going on a mystery trip with Dick.
That's so great.
I have no idea where we're going.
He's so much fun.
I'm so excited!
Now batting, number 23, Tyler Reynolds.
Okay! Come on! Go Tyler!
- Come on, Tyler!
- They're putting this kid in?
League rule.
Every kid has to play two innings.
Even kids like him.
- You shut your piehole.
- I'll kick your ass!
- Or I'll stuff my entire fist in your mouth!
- Burt Reynolds scrawny reject!
Hey, how old is that pitcher?
He looks like a NASCAR driver.
- Strike!
- Come on!
It's okay, buddy! Shake it off!
It's okay!
No. He's not gonna have one of his meltdowns, is he?
No. He has two more swings.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay. I better go now, then.
By the way, I need a week off.
Yeah, sure.
When's the vacation?
Two weeks from today.
Wait. No. That's not gonna work.
Because that's spring break and I've gotta take care of the boys.
- Strike two!
- Why?
It's okay, cutie, you got this!
Check out what happens when this kid strikes out.
- You have been warned, Ratso!
- One more comment and it is go time!
- I will crush you!
- So checkity check it!
I thought Mark was taking the kids whitewater rafting.
Shocker. He canceled.
Business trip.
Now I'm racking my brain trying to figure out how to compete with that.
You won't. There's no time.
And why should we both stay at home?
You are the bestest business partner ever. Heh.
- Strike three!
- I hate this!
I hate this!
I hate this! I suck!
No.
Boy. Here we go again.
God.
Maybe you should try badminton.
- Maybe you should try mouthwash!
- And deodorant!
- And some testosterone supplement!
- And some Cialis!
I'm just assuming!
And shave your neck!
It's very hairy.
God.
What?
No.
Damn it.
Rip that little loop off the back of your shirt.
And Step Three...
- Daddy?
- Yes.
What do you miss about Mommy?
What do I miss about Mommy?
Everything.
I miss her laugh.
And her smile.
And I miss her little nose that she gave to you.
Luckily you didn't get mine.
You'd look very weird.
- Heh. - Yeah.
I miss every time The Wizard of Oz was on.
- I love that movie.
- I know.
She would sing all the songs to us.
Especially "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."
You know what I miss most about her?
What?
Getting to tell her how much I love her.
Are you allowed to do that with anyone else?
Am I allowed?
Your mother, before she left that's all she would talk about, was me finding somebody else.
But I would tell her I can't because she's my one and only.
What did Mommy say?
Your mom would say my heart is so big that it has room for two.
That's another thing I miss about your mother.
She actually thought I was awesome.
I think you're awesome, Daddy.
Thank you.
Hey, Dad? Um...
I have a personal errand to run, and I need to borrow the car.
Well, you can't drive without me yet and somebody's got to stay here with your sisters.
Dad, I have a personal errand.
What does that even mean?
You taking a hit out on somebody?
Dad, she's monsterating.
- What?
- I have my period!
I forgot you get those.
"Tampax Pearls."
Douches. "Fresh Scent."
"Medicated" and "Sweet Romance."
Yeah, let's not be doing the Sweet Romance douches quite yet.
"Poise Feminine Wash."
"Poise"? That's a little close, guys.
"Always Clean"?
I could actually use those.
What's a Diva Cup?
Is that to make coffee?
I don't under...
What kind do you guys use?
- No!
- Hi.
Don't tell me.
- Lauren. - Lauren.
Mr. Hooters.
Jim.
What's going on in the sweater?
Just for the articles?
No. These, um, actually are for my son.
Wow. What a progressive mother.
No. I found a centerfold under his bed, and I tore it up.
From a magazine, not the Internet?
He's old school. I respect that.
Why'd you tear it up?
Because as a woman I was totally offended.
You don't have to be.
It's a normal part of growing up.
Okay, but he taped a picture of our babysitter's face on it.
Okay, that's sick. He needs help.
Borderline Dahmer situation.
Very funny. Okay, but if you had kids you'd understand...
- Three daughters.
- ...it's complicated.
You have three daughters?
Yes. Do you have any other children, or just the masturbator?
He has a younger brother.
Maybe you'll do a better job with that kid.
I'm just joking.
So what, you're here to replace it before the kid finds out?
Yes. But I can't tell what magazine it's from. I just...
Do you have any of the centerfold remnants?
Yes, I do.
I tried to tape it back up.
Did a great job. You can hardly tell.
Snapper magazine.
How can you tell?
From the staple placement and the way the paper feels and I already have this copy at home.
How about a fist bump?
- Yep, that's the one.
- Great.
Actually, I thought of something that might help us both to save us some embarrassment.
How about I bring that up to the cashier, and you bring this up for me.
Are these for your daughter?
- Yeah.
She's 15.
And her "friend" just paid a visit.
Okay. Well, these are for a much older "friend."
A much heavier "friend" staying in a much bigger "room" than your daughter has.
You lost me.
You found me.
- Can I get a bump?
- No.
No.
Okay. So you will do this.
That'll be $13.
Hi, I'm Tom.
- Here's your change.
- Hi, I'm Tom.
Yeah, you told me.
Next.
I remember the Slender Fit days.
You must be doing your Kegels.
Nowadays, I need six of these taped together.
Okay. Moving on.
And we got that and card.
Rockin' Saturday night, Lefty?
That's not mine. That's for her kid.
Ooh, pretty progressive mom.
- Yeah. That's what I said to her too.
- Why would you do that?
- I'm sorry. I'll get you out of it.
- What is wrong with you?
She just takes her homeschooling real serious, so that's why...
We get those back?
She's gotta get home to the kid and get him going.
- Take care.
- Yeah.
Hi, I'm Tom.
Thanks a lot for selling me out back there.
She didn't even hear about...
- I panicked. I'm sorry.
Here.
- I noticed.
Thank you.
I can't believe you have three girls.
- What does that even mean?
- I just can't imagine you with three girls.
Don't, then.
I'm sorry.
What are their names?
Hilary, Lou and Espn.
"Espin." That's unique.
Is it Biblical?
No. Named after my favorite network.
ESPN.
- No.
- Yep.
- What? - Heh.
Pretty cool.
My God.
Your wife must have been a saint.
She was.
Your husband must have been very patient dealing with...
Another charming sentiment from Captain Cheese Sticks.
You know what? Hooters is too good for you.
I'd never bring you there again.
Well, then I guess I'll just have to learn to get through life without Hooters.
You've been doing a pretty damn good job so far!
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I didn't realize they were that big.
Whatever.
Guys, unfortunately your dad had a business trip that came up so your whitewater rafting trip is gonna get postponed till this summer.
- What?
- We're stuck here doing nothing all week?
I have plans. I have great plans actually.
Like what?
Bowling and going to the mall?
How did you know?
- Bet that's Dad!
- Maybe he'll take us on his business trip!
- Hey. Is your mom home?
- What do you mean "Is your mom home"?
- Who are you?
- I'm Jim.
What is this, Dateline NBC?
Yes, you got it right.
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to your mother.
- Not a big deal.
- She said she's not interested in you.
Believe me, Frodo, I don't like her either.
I have to sort something out with her.
- Brendan, honey, who's at the...?
- Hey.
- Jim.
- You lied! Liar! You like him!
What?
I didn't lie, honey.
He's a buffoon.
- Just like I said.
- Don't talk to me!
Ever!
No, sweetie, come on.
- What?
- Great.
Which one was the masturbator?
The big one?
Why are you here?
What do you want?
The old bag at the pharmacy mixed up our cards.
That's impossible because I keep my cards very organized.
I keep them in color-coded sleeves...
All right, I'll give this back to whoever it belongs to. Lauren Reynolds.
You know her?
God, I don't know what's wrong with me lately.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Just come in.
So wait. How do you know where I live?
I Googled you and "Closet Queens" came up.
- You're a lesbian?
- No.
We organize "closets" and we're the best, so we're "queens."
"Closet Queens."
Maybe the picture was confusing me.
What picture?
Those little weasels.
Your girlfriend, like, does she know we went on a date?
Is she gonna kill me?
She looks nuts.
- Lauren!
- Well, here she is.
- I have to talk to you!
- I never touched her. She repulses me.
- What?
- What?
Jen, what's wrong?
- It's over between me and Dick.
- Over?
I thought you don't like dick.
But you guys just started using the L word.
The L Word. I saw that show.
You guys love that one I'm guessing.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Are you here to fix something?
- You should probably go and do that.
- I'm Jim. I'm not a threat.
- Jim?
- The blind-date guy.
- You said that was a disaster.
- It was.
You said he was a chubby loser.
He is.
You didn't mention he has that high phlegmy voice like he drinks a lot of dairy.
- I know.
- Standing right here, ladies.
Hearing everything.
All right, our cards got switched so we're just dealing with that.
What happened with Dick?
He just dropped a major bomb on me.
He's married.
No, worse.
He's got kids.
You're still here.
Why?
You still have my card. "Why?"
Wait. You're just gonna break up with him because he has children?
Five children. Five.
What am I, Julie Andrews?
I'm gonna sew matching outfits and sing to escape the Nazis?
He asked me if I wanted to be "part of the team."
- No, I don't! - Maybe you should just go on the trip and, you know, spend some alone time with Dick.
See, he wanted the kids to come with us.
He wanted me to get to know them in a "fun and neutral environment."
Is his last name Theodopolis?
- Yes.
- That's incredible. That's my boss.
He owns all the Dick's Sporting Goods.
I manage the one in Ridgefield.
Of course you do.
Dick takes a lot of special needs people, makes them "managers" of something so they can have a business card and feel important.
Good for you!
That explains it. That explains a lot.
You know, actually I applied to work at Closet Queens but they said there's already a gorilla filling that position.
It's a thyroid thing.
- Where was he gonna take you?
Africa.
It was gonna be incredible. Look at that.
- Sun, sand, safaris. - Wow.
- My God.
- He must really like you a lot.
Sorry, I'm not getting it at all.
Okay. And this concludes our business.
Thank you.
Africa.
So he's just gonna go here all by himself with his kids now?
No. He's heartbroken now.
Nobody gets to go.
Damn it!
Why does he have to have joint custody?
I thought the mother always got the kids.
I mean, this is a week away.
I hope he gets his money back.
- A week out? Not a chance.
- Aah!
Well, maybe they do things differently in Africa.
I forgot you were an expert at closets and African refund policies.
Okay. Kick him out.
Don't let him talk to you like that.
- Get out.
- I'm leaving.
Jen. My boys would give anything to go on a vacation like this.
Mr. Theodopolis. Hi. It's Jim Friedman.
I don't mean to be a vulture picking on the carcass of your dead relationship. But I wonder if you'd sell me the vacation you were gonna go on with Freddy Krueger's sister?
I have been saving and saving.
I could never give him full value for it but something's better than nothing, right, sir?
It would just be the three of us.
It would just be the four of us so we only need one room.
My God.
Wait until I tell the boys.
Wait till I tell the girls!
We're going to Africa!
Welcome to Africa
Welcome, welcome
I can't believe we're here.
This is pretty cool, Mom.
Yeah.
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome
So I did good?
This is better than, like, bowling and the mall?
Yeah.
- Welcome, welcome
- Africa!
Thank you so much. Thank you.
This is terrific. This is great.
What the fu...?
- Brendan!
- What the fudge is he doing here?
We're going on family vacations together now?
I have no idea why they followed us to Africa.
Is this a sick dream?
What is happening right now?
You're stalking my mom!
You're a predator!
Hey!
Don't talk to my dad like that, butthole!
- Language!
- How about you don't correct my daughter?
She can say "butthole" if she wants to.
- Butthole!
Butthole! - Not you.
I hear thunder on the mountain. Ha-ha-ha.
Welcome to South Africa.
Mfana at your service.
Mfana.
Jim.
I mean, Dick.
Dick Theodopolis.
Welcome, Dick Theodopolis!
And you are traveling with one little girl and two...
- Big girls.
- Ha-ha-ha. Of course.
And you must be Miss Palmer.
Yes.
Jen Palmer.
I see what you did.
I see what you did too.
Are you ready for the most exciting, amazing, and romantic week of your entire lives?
Exciting, amazing, romantic!
Yeah, we're here for the zero romance package.
You still haven't told the children, my friends?
Told the children what?
- Do I have a new mommy?
- Mfana.
Will you do us a favor? Leave us alone for just two secs.
- Which means "of course."
- Thank you.
All right. Listen. Would you just reassure my son that we're not dating.
We are not dating!
I promise you.
This is not a face I want to wake up to every morning.
Wow. You'd be lucky to wake up to that every day.
My mom is frigging hot.
Did you just say your mom was hot?
No! Not hot...!
That's just wrong.
- Tyler! Tyler! - Whoo!
- Get down from there!
God! Please, please, please, please get down!
This place is ginormous!
My God!
Follow me. Right this way.
Welcome to your familymoon.
This is so cool.
Now we're talking!
This is Africa, baby!
We'll take this room.
No! We want this room.
Silly Theocropolises!
This is for the children.
This room is for the mama and the papa.
Look at that bed.
- Huge.
- Awesome.
- This is so cool.
- Look at this candy.
Here is where you make more Theopotamuses.
My bad.
What part of "not dating" does this bed fit into?
- Boy. - Okay.
You know what?
Everybody fall into line.
Brendan, Tyler honey, I need you on the couch.
Hilary, C-SPAN, Lou...
Espn, Espn.
Excuse me.
Espn. I'm sorry, honey.
My God.
Dick was gonna propose to Jen.
A family honeymoon, a "familymoon."
And your dumb friend ruined it.
Here's what's gonna happen.
The first room we saw, we're gonna take that. And you and your deranged boys can have Wilt Chamberlain's headquarters.
Dude, what are you eating?
"Cherry Pan-ties."
What are "Cherry Pan-ties"?
Let me see that.
- No! God!
Spit it out!
Spit it out!
Just no Cherry Pan-ties ever!
Out, out, out!
Hey, Mom. I guess this used to be a firehouse.
Look at this place. Wow.
Hello, Mr. Snuffleupagus.
Theodopolis.
Hello...
Girls.
- Girls. They're girls.
- That's twice.
Let's go, guys...
Girls.
23. We're looking for 23.
There it is.
'Hi!
How you doing?
I think we're sharing a table with you.
Yeah.
Hi! I'm Eddy Wernick and this is Ginger Wernick and our son, Jake.
We're from Vancouver.
Okay. I'm your son. All right?
Ginger would've had to give birth to me when she was 6. She's not my mom.
Okay. Get it out there for everyone.
Sharing it, loving it. No holding back.
That's good.
- All right. Let's do our thing.
Come on. - Isn't this place fantastic?
So romantic.
Good. Gonna have a nice trip here.
- Um, Dad?
- Hey, sweetie.
Where should I sit?
You can sit anywhere you want.
What about Mom?
Where does she sit?
Where do you want her to sit?
Next to me?
Then that's where she'll sit.
Go ahead.
Get right next to Lou.
Your mom's right there.
Okay?
All good.
Ignoring it. Ignoring the weirdness.
Where's the funeral at, boys?
Where's the golf tournament at, girls?
No. No, no, no, no.
Mfana. Mfana!
Yes! Missus...?
Reynolds.
Palmer!
Just not his wife, okay?
I don't wanna sit here.
Not gonna happen. Ha, ha.
I'm afraid it must happen, ma'am.
All tables are filled and this is your family.
Please sit with us.
You give it a try.
Every family fights.
You make it better.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Try the chakalaka.
- Hi, new people.
- Hello.
This is Lauren, by the way, and her children, the karate kids:
Wax On and Wax Off.
Isn't this place fantastic?
It's so romantic.
Sorry, what'd you say?
So romantic!
Easy.
Keeping it classy, Ginger?
Jakey, you have something on your face.
It's a mole.
Hey! You can't sit there.
- Why not?
- My mom's sitting there.
- Is she in the bathroom or something?
- No. She's sitting there right now.
Are you on meds?
It's okay, Espn.
We'll get Brendan another chair.
Thank you.
Whatever. I'm just gonna go to the buffet.
Tyler, come with me.
They eat fried caterpillars here.
Hell, yeah!
Very nice.
Girls, why don't you hit the buffet also?
Larry, make sure you have plenty of beef, okay?
Gotta bulk up for the season.
Love you. Go on.
"Bulk up for the season"?
What is she, a bear?
She's trying out for girls' varsity this year.
A lot of big ladies out there.
- She's gonna eat her way into the starting five.
Hello, everybody!
My name is Nickens.
And we are Thathoo!
We play traditional South African isicathamiya music with a little bit of American soul.
- It is getting a little hot in here.
Finally, my huge African arms are free.
Yeah, baby!
Yes, they are.
No.
I would like to welcome you to our Fourth Annual Blended Familymoon Week!
- What's a blended family?
- I don't know. It sounds painful, though.
I am looking out at all you beautiful stepchildren, stepdads, stepmoms half-brothers, same-sex domestic partners, and good old-fashioned booty calls gone wrong. Ha-ha-ha.
Now, even though the emphasis is on family we here at the beautiful Sun City Resort want to make sure you get some alone time.
Because alone time can sometime take a long time we have many supervised activities for the young ones to do.
We have a fabulous jungle play zone.
A nightly pool party.
Hey, Espn. Why aren't you getting in?
Is your mom afraid of the water?
Good one, Mom.
Magical animal time.
Little one, wouldn't you like to try petting a living animal?
He's dead?
And our famous Tekula teen disco!
Hey, dude. There's a lot of hot chicks out here.
The best time.
What the heck is...?
What is that?
Are you kidding me?
My God! Are you kidding me?
My God! God!
God! Crocodile!
Crocodile attack!
Help me! Somebody help me!
Please don't kill me! God! My God!
Mr. Bellyflopolis, the crocodiles are fake!
They're fake?
Yes, they're fake!
Why would you make them look so realistic?
Well, to scare the baboons away.
You just scared a zebra stripe into my underwear!
Don't worry!
What happens in Africa, stays in Africa.
Tyler. Okay.
Excuse me.
That's one way to get him to sleep through the night.
- You saw that?
- I actually heard it.
I think they heard it in Uganda.
It was a lot easier when he was Lou's age.
Of course, let me help you out here.
Here you are. You're home.
- Thank you. - Absol...
Too late. - Aah!
All right, all right, all right. Pick him up.
Three-second rule. Three-second rule.
Good, good, good. You're fine. He's fine.
Okay, now I'm getting scared.
Okay.
Sleep, sleep.
Too hot in here.
No blanket, okay?
Here's your buddy.
Love ya, love ya.
Mom's sleeping there.
Okay, can I sleep with her?
No, you'll crush her.
No, I could get in with her and spoon with her. It would be nice.
- I don't wanna see that.
- No. Okay.
We'll let Mommy rest. I'll... I'll figure it out.
I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.
Good night.
- Sleep good.
Me and you there, shorty.
Okay, that's right.
Right on my neck.
That's gonna make a nice evening for me.
Hey, guys. It is time to wake up.
Africa awaits us. It's a beautiful morning.
- Is he crazy?
- Go away. It's way too early.
Lou, will you wake up with Daddy, please?
In the name of Lucifer, let us sleep.
Up, up, up, you two.
I have quite a day planned.
I need a coffee.
Morning.
- Big day planned?
- Yeah.
7:15 nature walk. 8:30 petting zoo. 10:00 a.m. native crafts.
The boys, they're so excited.
Really?
My girls are ecstatic also.
Just jumping up and down on the bed.
Can't believe they're here.
- Cream?
- No, thank you.
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.
- Couldn't get the boys out of bed?
- No.
The girls?
The girls are probably sleeping the rest of the trip.
Possible exorcism coming for the little one. We'll see what happens.
Well, it's beautiful here.
Yeah.
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Have a good one.
You won't see that in New Jersey.
Okay. All right. All right.
Here we go. Okay. Here you go, baby.
That's it, sweetie. Take him down.
Take him! That's it.
Back him.
Use your weight!
Muscle him.
- Use your body. - Unh!
- Yeah! Finish it!
And bam! That's it!
Yes!
Yes! Way to go, Larry.
Winners up.
Let's go. Give me the ball. Buddy.
Up top.
And we go in. Let's go. Get loose.
Cut.
Cut! Larry!
Move!
Come on. What are you doing?
Larry?
Just cut! Go! Break it.
Shake him off. Come on.
Are you voguing right now?
What is happening?
Here! Just take the ball.
Work the kid. Work him. Lose him.
Cross him. Cross him over. Cross him.
Don't skip!
Why you moving like that?
Is it the bra?
Because if it's the bra, just take it off.
You don't need it anyways.
What?
What are you doing?
We just started.
Is your boy okay?
Why does he wear a bra?
She's a girl.
You suck.
MEN You suck, you suck, you suck You suck, you suck, you suck
You suck, you suck, you suck You schooled by a little girl
Your boy has no skills
You schooled by a little girl
Tyler, slow down!
Come on, Mom!
We're going four miles per hour.
That's plenty fast enough.
Fast and safe.
Miss Palmer!
It's okay to go fast.
Okay, Mfana.
Watch me!
- You're going the wrong way!
- Watch out, Grandma!
My bad.
The blending process is really going well for us.
My husband's 13-year-old still has some hatred issues towards me. But it is becoming less physical, so it's a start.
- That's great.
- Good for you.
I woke up this morning with a pillow pressed against my face.
But I could sense some guilt afterwards. So that's progress.
Hang in there, ladies. There's a light at the end of the tunnel.
This little angel here is finally starting to think of me as her second mom.
Not just her former gymnastics teacher.
What are you drawing, honey?
It's a picture of elephants stomping on your head and making you dead.
- Heh-heh-heh. - Stop it.
Don't worry.
What happens in Africa stays in Africa.
Bump my fist?
- Ha, ha. Jim's so funny.
- Yeah.
My head is boiling, Mom.
Get it off.
I'm trying.
- Why did you tie it with so many knots?
- I didn't want it to come flying off.
My God!
What happened to her face?
- I painted it. She's a kitty cat.
- Are you wearing eye shadow?
I made Daddy a princess, but he washed the paint off.
Well, not all the way off because he looks a little like Lady Gaga.
Why is this kid wearing a helmet?
Are you carrying him to bed again or something?
No, I tied the chin strap too many times.
I can't get it off.
Best thing about working at a sporting goods store: Swiss Army knives.
- Just be careful.
- I'll go easy.
Thank you.
- Daddy, I gotta go to the bathroom.
- You do? Okay.
Can she take me?
She's got her own life to live.
What do you gotta do? One or two?
- Number one.
- I can handle this.
- Okay.
- Will you watch him?
- And I mean watch him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it, home slice.
- Okay. - For sure.
What's number one again?
It's a pee-pee.
And sometimes he wipes too hard.
I'm sure he doesn't mean to.
No, he's a good daddy. He just doesn't have a bagina.
Okay, honey. Let's wash your hands.
He's a bad daddy!
He made me look like the walking dead!
No!
Okay.
All right.
Let's see what we have in the magic bag here.
Perfect.
All right.
You're pretty.
You're prettier.
I said you are.
Shut up and let me do your makeup.
Don't worry. They're around.
I'm not worried.
Maybe that's where they are.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Tyler?
- Hold on, now!
- Excuse me.
- Hold on, big time!
My God! I'm gonna kill him.
Yeah, baby! Hold on, now!
Whoa! Easy, homey. easy!
Tyler!
Get off that dodo bird right now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everything's fine.
The safety instructor's on top of it.
Look at me, Mom!
I'm a cowboy!
Well, partner, I bet I can stay on longer than you!
It's on, sheriff.
No "longer"! No "staying"!
- I can't be beat!
- I can't hear you!
You're going down!
I'm never gonna fall off!
Never!
Whoo! One hand, mama!
Ooh! Good!
Yes! I win!
I'm the king of Africa!
- Whoa! - Tyler!
A winner!
Are you kidding me?
Whoo, boom! You're a moron, okay?
Because he could've broken his neck!
Mom. Mom, Mom.
Did you see that? I stuck the landing and did the bull dance.
I saw it.
Thank you so much for taking me on this trip, Mom.
This is the best day of my life!
Okay.
Great!
Good! Good. I love you so much.
- I'm so glad you're having fun.
You're welcome.
Thank you so much.
- Why you flipping my dad off?
- I'm not.
Yo! Check out white girl in the neighborhood.
Am I right, my brothers? Woo-woo!
I can't believe your dad's into my mom.
He doesn't like her. She's into him.
No way. He's goofy and flabby all over.
My mom's gorgeous with a rocking body.
Hey, that's sick, man.
That was out of context!
Was it?
You know, you should just go talk to him because he probably won't bite.
No, no. I can't.
Got a boyfriend back at home?
Please. All the guys at my school pretty much assume I'm a lesbian.
And not the hot kind.
Well, have you ever considered, say, like changing your hairstyle?
Our barber only really knows how to do this and crew cuts.
- So...
- A barber?
Like the kind with a pole outside?
He cut our grandfather's hair. He cuts my dad's hair.
- And now he cuts our hair. Heh.
- May I just...?
Yup.
You have such a beautiful face.
You know, it's funny because I was actually on my way to the salon.
Do you wanna come check it out with me?
For what?
For a hairdo for a girl in this century.
I would but I'd have to ask my dad for the money.
No. No, no, no. It's on me.
Really?
It would make me so happy.
Because I don't get to do this with my boys.
- Come on, Prince Valiant. - Heh.
- I don't know who that is but okay.
- Okay.
Where do you buy your clothes?
Dad gets most of our clothes from work.
Then I guess we should be grateful he doesn't work at Hooters.
No, my mom worked at Hooters.
She what?
My mom, she used to work at Hooters.
She managed the one over on Lake Street.
So then he gets down on one knee and proposes.
Right in the middle of kickboxing class.
He's lucky he didn't get kicked in the nuts.
My nuts! Ha-ha-ha.
Espn. This is the best passion fruit I've ever tasted. Try it.
And I got some for your mom too.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So how'd you two sexicans meet?
Yeah! Hitting them with the hard questions.
I like it.
Well, we met on a blind date.
Those are the worst.
I've been on 10 blind dates in my life.
All fatties. Ten for ten. All fatties.
No offense, Jim.
What?
So what happened?
Where'd he take you?
Actually, Hooters.
Here we go.
Which was wonderful service, nice people, really great.
Aw. How romantic.
Aw, everyone's shimmying now.
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. Ha-ha-ha.
Why you no shimmy, Jimmy? Shimmy.
Jim?
Where's Larry?
What happened to Larry?
I'm right here, Dad.
Why were the...?
How did this...?
What's happening right now?
Um, well, Lauren gave me her salon appointment and they put in hair extensions and makeup and she even told them how to style it and what to do, what not to do.
She was pretty amazing.
She was amazing?
Do you want to go get some sushi from the bar?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, scarecrow!
She's gotta bulk up!
Pork chops! Lamb chops!
Tri-tip!
Let's go get our beef on?
I think someone new came to dinner.
A flying baby named Cupid.
Aah! You got me!
Now we're both in love.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
I just looked at my daughter, and I didn't really recognize her.
Kind of threw me off for a minute.
Well, she's 15, you know?
She's bound to grow up at some point.
I know. Call me crazy. I just thought maybe that would be my decision because she's my kid!
Okay! Awkward moment. Uncomfortable.
Tension. I'm leaving the table.
Who's with me?
- Me!
Me! - I'm going.
I just... Can I ask you?
What made you think you could tart up my daughter without my permission?
You're right. I'm sorry. I am.
I just find it hypocritical from someone who nearly killed my son.
So it was getting even? Is that it?
No, it's not getting even but I just...
- She's beautiful.
- Right.
With that pageboy Prince Valiant haircut you gave her...
She looked very nice with that haircut.
...and the tracksuit, are you kidding me?
Dying on the inside to come out!
Her mother was tomboyish at her age and that was fine with me.
You knew your wife when she was 15?
I knew my wife when I was 13.
I had a crush on her. I have no idea why she liked me back.
I was 90 percent goofy and 10 percent loser.
Well, I was 60 percent Urkel and 40 percent Screech.
Put it to you this way: If I didn't have braces, my teeth would be hitting you right now.
I'm sorry I yelled at you. I feel like a jerk because I put your kid on a gooney bird...
- ...and I didn't ask your permission.
- No, but listen. You're right.
I need to let go of the reins a little bit.
I just want to say on behalf of Thathoo how happy we are to see you two lovebirds finally blending.
No, we're not blending. We were just having a conversation.
- Just happy we haven't killed each other yet.
- Heh. Yes, yes, you are blending
We don't feel that way about each other!
Yes, you'll be touching
Like wine and bobotie
All right, let's go and get our beef on!
And like malva pudding
All right, thank you.
I think they're blending over there! Come now!
Come now!
They're blending over here!
Daddy, look!
What?
I thought I saw an eagle.
I saw a camel!
Hey, Hilary.
You wanna come in our truck?
Shouldn't you be in your coffin?
The sun's out right now.
Take a walk, homes.
Go ahead.
- My God.
Look, children.
The bush pig has lost its parents so it is being cared for by Mama and Papa Lion.
Even in nature there are blended families.
- That's nice. - That's sweet.
I may have misread that situation.
- You think so, buddy?
- What is wrong with you?
Yeah, Lauren!
Yeah. baby!
- No!
- You can do it, Mom!
Go Lauren! Go Lauren!
My God.
Emotional.
Time passing. Changes.
It's... it's... It's hard.
You gotta let it go. Turning the page. Moving on.
She was a little kid just a...
Processing it. Accepting it.
The circle of life. Painful, though.
It hurts, right?
No. Not for me. I got a boy.
But you're in the shithouse.
Thanks.
Aah! The view is splendid!
Which mean "who's next?"
Please, Mom?
What?
That? Are you crazy?
No.
If Mfana can do it, I could do it.
It's totally safe.
There is no way I'm going to let you do that.
Unless I try it first...
- ...and make sure you can handle it.
- Yes! Yeah! Yeah!
Your mom is gonna do it.
You have nothing to worry about.
You are in tight.
You got 50-gauge webbing here.
Possibly malaria is the only thing you gotta think about.
Don't swallow anything weird up there.
Okay. What happens if, like, I wanna signal for help... - ...or, like, if I decide to change my mind?
- Whoa! Yeah, baby!
- You look good!
- My God! I change my mind! I change my mind!
- That's awesome!
My God!
It's beautiful!
Go, Mama, go!
Aah! There are giraffes!
Jim, there are giraffes right there! I can see them!
Well, say hello for me!
This is so pretty!
My God! Elephants! Elephants!
- Thatta girl!
- Go Lauren!
Why is she screaming?
She's not screaming.
She's howling. She's having fun.
Looking good up there, baby!
Fly, Mrs. Thorpopolis!
Fly like the wind!
Tyler! You've gotta try this!
Why you slowing down?
- We're out of gas.
- You're out of gas? What does that mean?
We used to have gas. But now we're out.
My God! What's happening?
Jim!
- We're out of gas!
- What?
- No.
- My God! No!
This is all your fault!
Don't worry!
My dad's gonna come up with a plan!
- What's the plan?
- Look for a gas station.
You suck.
Why did I let you talk me into this?
Listen to me!
When you get close to the ground start running fast!
I have the legs of a corgi dog!
It doesn't matter right now!
Move those little babies!
You cannot let your kids see you die like this!
Go! Go! Go!
Now! Get those legs going!
My God!
Rhino!
- Rhino, rhino!
Spread them!
- My God!
- Spread the legs!
- Aah! - Her bagina!
Yeah!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
I didn't have you pegged for the massage type of guy.
It's the first massage I'll ever do in my life.
I have to. To see if they can rub my pancreas out of my neck.
My God. You're welcome, by the way.
For what?
"For what?" For saving you.
You didn't save me.
You told me to keep running.
Why didn't you catch me?
I was supposed to catch you?
Who am I, Batman?
Coming at me like 700 miles an hour.
You're weighing about a buck fifty.
The inertia would rip my arms off my body.
Yes. That's me.
I weigh a buck fifty. If I'm holding your left ass cheek.
- I don't know what women weigh.
- You don't know anything.
- We'll see. - Have a nice massage.
All right. Now do the same on your partner while making sure to continue to look deeply into each others' eyes.
- What is this?
- A scene out of The Doors?
I don't know.
Ma'am? Yeah. I booked a massage.
Yes. You've booked for the Art of Couples massage.
- I just got a call from my babysitter...
- There was an avalanche in my back yard...
Come on!
This is exactly what you guys need.
We'll form a massage train.
I'll be the caboose.
- Unacceptable.
- I'm joking.
- Join us.
- No, ma'am.
- I'm so good.
- I'm being totally honest...
I think you should.
This way. - And there you go.
- My God.
Okay!
Let's loosen things up by stroking your lover's neck.
Okay, come on now.
Don't be bashful.
Give yourself over to the pleasure of your loving partner's touch.
Yeah.
- Hello.
- How are you?
Remember to keep the touch soft.
Lightly brush your fingers against her skin.
It's so...
God! What's happening?
- Is there a bug on me?
- No. There's no bug. I was just trying to get some skin, like she said.
- Well, that hurts the jugular.
- I won't do it.
I'm sorry. I don't know how to give you a...
Okay, so...
There you go.
- That's actually really nice.
Heh.
- Good. God.
I feel like I'm relaxing.
It's wonderful.
Excuse me. Am I gonna get some sort of rub action here or does the guy do all the work in Africa?
Very funny, Mr. Moptopolis.
But he's right. Ladies, it's time for you to join in.
As your partner moves down to your shoulders, reach out and touch his ears.
Gently rub the lobes between your thumb and index finger as if you were rubbing the morning dew off a flower petal.
- Are these your flower petals?
- Yes. - Now rub the dew. Ha, ha.
I'd be doing you a really big favor if I just yanked these goofy things right off.
Just shut up, schlumpy shoulders.
- I do have schlumpy shoulders.
- No, you don't. They're very nice.
But you know what helps if you need to work on your posture?
Here, just lift your arms a little bit.
Watch, I'll show you. Right...
Feels very good.
- You have nice shoulders.
- Really? You really have a lot of muscle.
- Not as much as you.
- Heh. From carrying that kid around and smashing his head.
Yeah!
Mr. Wernick. Those are not your wife's shoulders.
Busted!
Loving it though.
Respect the vision.
- Gotta go for it, right?
That was so relaxing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hope I put your pancreas back where it belongs.
I don't even know where it is right now.
- Are you my sexy little wormhole?
- Yeah, I'm your sexy little wormhole!
They have fun.
That's very pretty.
You were very nice. Thank you.
Heh. You know.
You're a strong woman. Strong hands.
I'm glad you like my hands.
Daddy?
Can Lauren put me to bed?
Sweetheart, Daddy will put you to bed in one second.
But I want Lauren.
Lauren... Another time, Lauren will do that.
But I want her to put me to bed tonight.
And Daddy said no.
No.
No!
I want Lauren.
I'm flattered.
That's good. You're all right.
Okay.
How's that? Are you all cozy now?
Yes.
Daddy?
Can you give us some alone time?
I could go to the bathroom outside.
Is that what you want?
Thrown out of my own tent.
I own him.
It seems that way.
Can you rub my head so I have good dreams?
Of course.
What a cute little head.
Couldn't go a little further from the tent?
What do you want from me?
There could be gorillas out here, ready to kill.
Well, why don't you get them to give you some Flomax or something.
Yep, getting older. I'll give you that.
Can you sing to me?
Um, sure.
What should I sing?
- There's a gorilla right there!
- Aah! I'm just kidding!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I just couldn't handle how emotional it was getting. I just...
I'm sorry. Get some rest.
I didn't mean to do that to you.
So get in your stance. That's right.
And spread your legs just a little bit.
Like an inch. Elbow up. It's all about balance.
That's right. That's right. Keep your weight right there.
How do you even play cricket?
We're not playing cricket.
We're playing baseball. The only thing at the hotel they had was this stupid battle thingamajiggy.
Who's that guy?
He's some guy named Dale.
He'll be pitching to you.
Yeah, in cricket we don't pitch, we bowl.
Hey, Dale. How much am I paying you?
Five Brooklyn T-shirts from your sporting goods store.
Okay, I'm gonna make it four if you correct me again.
All right, Dale. Pitch... Or bowl one in.
- I stink at this.
- No, it's not you.
It's not you. Dale, you think maybe you can reach the plate?
That would help.
Actually, in cricket we bounce the...
I'll try.
I'll try. All right. Elbow up.
I don't wanna do this!
Hey. What are you doing?
You don't throw your bat. Or whatever this thing is called.
- A bat.
- Thank you.
You're an athlete.
You're a sportsman. You gotta respect your equipment.
- Yes, sir.
- We ain't leaving here till you hit the ball as good as you ride an ostrich.
Pick up the bat.
Hey. I know you're up there all alone.
It's scary. You feel like all the pressure's on you.
But guess what? The pressure is on him.
Doesn't look like he's feeling the pressure.
He's feeling it all right. He doesn't think he can get the ball past you.
I want you to look him right in the eyes and let him know you own him.
Go ahead. That's it, big time.
Give him the stink eye.
What's his problem?
Well, look at that. You rattled him.
Okay. Dale, pitch it in if ya got the guts.
Whoa! Yes!
Did you see that? I killed it!
Let's do it a hundred more times.
If I hit like that, my dad's gonna start coming to my games.
What's going on here?
Jim just taught me how to make the pitcher my bitch.
My brother doesn't need you to teach him how to hit!
Okay. You wanna show him how to do it?
Let's see what you got.
I don't need to prove anything to you, d-bag.
Dale, did he really just call me a d-bag?
This shit just got real.
I'm gonna kill you.
Okay, we'll see. Let's get your gloves up. Face protected.
Kick his ass, Brendan!
- What's that?
- Kick his ass, Jim!
Whoa, whoa. You see, you gotta look at your target.
How about I put a picture of your babysitter on my face? Will you look at it then?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just leave her out of this!
Use your right hand.
You're better with that one.
All right, all right.
- You seem pissed at me.
- You just hit me!
No! Before that. Before that, like when we first met.
- Just think that my mom could do better.
- First of all, she can't do better.
Because no one's better than me.
I am the greatest. Secondly, I think it's nice that you wanna protect your mommy.
I hate you!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Calm down.
That was good though. Showing a little something in there.
Listen, being a man ain't about pissing and moaning anytime something's bothering you.
It's about dealing with what's in front of you.
Are you okay?
That was sneaky. But I'm fine.
Does that make me a man now, Jimbo?
No.
Asking me if I was okay, that was a start.
They are blending
They are bonding
Yeah, that's great. Didn't know you guys worked out together, but it makes sense.
When one person
Meets another
Come together
They are blending
And then what happened?
The bowler threw it, and I hit it like a mile away.
Yeah. And then Jim taught me how to box.
And after 5 minutes, I basically knocked him out.
Yeah!
Well, that was nice of him.
Kind of worked out well, they came on this trip.
Yes, it did.
Lauren, you looked so hot in this dress, I had to buy it for you.
And by "buy," I mean "steal. "
Hope you're having fun on my vacation.
So its tongue was ridiculous. It got me, like, all over.
It was, like, in balls. They were like:
Like a stem going against each other, head-to-head.
Dad. Did you comb your hair?
No. Got out of the shower like this, I guess.
You took a shower?
I shower!
I'm allowed to shower.
My God. - I haven't taken a shower since we got here.
- I know. You stink.
I love it. Yeah, I stink bad.
Yeah, you stink real bad. Your breath smells terrible.
Where's Lauren?
Wow. - Look at Mom.
- Hello.
Dad! Say something to her.
Yes, yes. You look very, very nice.
Well, thank you.
Am I really known as the non-shower guy?
I shower all the time, guys.
No, he doesn't.
Ladies and gentlemen it's the final night of our blended family experience here in Africa.
Our tradition is to invite the kiddies to the pool area for our famous kids-only safari buffet and 10-foot chocolate rain forest fountain!
Can we go, Dad?
All right, go ahead. Stay with you sisters though.
My boy here's a chocoholic. You better watch out. Or he's gonna jump in and come out looking like a handsome Hershey bar.
Did you see that?
I made him smile. He tried not to but he couldn't help himself.
- We're gonna be a great family.
- Yes, we are.
Love you.
All of the little ones have gone.
Tonight the dining room is: Adults-only.
Yeah, now we're getting there.
Let's have all you blended lovers on the dance floor.
Love
Is a many blended thing
It's the April rose
That only grows In the early spring
It's crazy?
The song.
He took the word "splendid" and replaced it with "blended."
So clever. It rhymes!
But, the real word is "splendored."
So wouldn't it be "blendored"?
What's this now?
I'm just rambling. I'm sorry.
- Heh. - Are you ready, Mr. Chiapetolis?
"Chiapetolis"?
All right. He finally got it.
- Heh. Ready for what?
- You scheduled a star-gazing experience.
So Mrs. Chiapetolis, would you like to come join me?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Once
High on a windy hill
Or two hills, that's good
On a morning mist, Two lovers kiss
Just a little bit farther.
- All right.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Here we are.
Dinner for two.
Wow. This is good.
I gotta give it up to Dick. He's probably the most romantic guy on the planet.
Yeah, he's got the moves. No doubt about it.
I bet this is where he was gonna ask Jen to marry him.
Maybe.
We were able to get everything you asked for this morning except the sticks of cheese in the shape of a heart.
Cheese sticks?
Did you set this up?
I wanted a do-over.
For that first date fiasco.
I'm better than that.
Which means:
"Lovers long for the moment their souls may blend in a whisper."
May this be your moment.
Did you eat pork chops with tuna fish today at lunch?
- Yes, I did.
- I can tell. Apologies. I will brush my teeth presently, Mr. Lollipopolis.
I'd brush them twice.
And did you really call me "Lollipopolis"?
It's Theodopolis. Just for the record.
I just like to have fun Jim Friedman.
- Wha...?
- What?
- That was good.
- Thank you, Mfana.
How about Thathoo showing up everywhere?
They were in my shower this morning.
I had a very nice time with them too.
There she is.
Thank you so much.
Hey, Bubbles.
Nice wiggle, but you grew a tail.
Here's looking at you.
No, really. Looking at you, because you're actually looking at me this time.
You have the most beautiful kids.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
You're a great mom too.
You're a pretty good mom yourself.
I'll take that.
Tyler has a playoff game on Saturday...
Yeah?
...and I think that for the very first time, he won't actually be completely dreading it, thanks to you.
Tell your... His father the more he works with him, the more he's gonna get confident the more he's gonna belt the ball anytime he gets up there.
Yeah, well, his dad's not really into working with him, you know because to do that, he'd have to show up, which he's just not good at.
You gotta show up for your kids.
It should be boring how reliable a parent is.
It's funny to me that some people don't get that.
You do! I mean, your kid needs to come first 100 percent of the time.
Absolutely. 99 percent.
One percent of the time, I think we are allowed to get what we want.
Aah. God.
I forgot what it was like to want something.
I vaguely remember it feels good.
I can't do this.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I really...
I'm... It's not you.
I thought I could do this.
Sorry about them too.
They're still awesome.
Sorry I did that to you.
He didn't kiss you?
He's an idiot.
Although, you have to admit. The monkeys playing the violins and stuff?
That is hilarious.
I can't believe that we both found these great guys and we're not gonna end up with them.
Are you gonna get that?
Hi. It's not a good time right now.
I L word you so hard.
And you know what? I am gonna make L word to you for at least an hour and a half.
Okay.
That was my mom.
And she's doing good.
All right. I'm giving Dick another chance.
To do what? Get rid of his kids?
I'm gonna meet his children.
You should try saying that without contorting your face so much.
I'm gonna meet his children.
Heh. Better.
I'm sorry about Jim.
Me too.
Why didn't you kiss her, man?
I couldn't. I just...
I was afraid it wasn't the right thing to do.
What did Africa do to you?
That doesn't hurt.
I'm trying my best. Just sit still.
- Does it look pretty?
- It looks fantastic.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You look nice.
- Thanks.
- Where you off to?
- I'm going on a date with Jake.
How can you go out with Jake?
He lives in Vancouver.
Hi, Mr. Friedman.
Yay there, Skeletor.
Listen, make sure plenty of beef.
Seriously. She's got tryouts this week.
Lamb chops, pork chops, tri-tips.
You got it. That's the way.
Garbage twisties?
- I don't know how to...
- You're awful. Just fix it then.
So when are we gonna see Lauren again?
Something happened between you guys.
No. What are you, crazy?
Nothing happened.
Dad, come on. I saw the way you looked at her.
- And I saw the way she looked at you.
- It's undeniable. - You guys are infatuated with each other.
- Jake, butt out.
Sorry, sir.
Don't you guys have anything better to do than look at people looking at each other?
Besides, what am I supposed to do?
Change our whole lives just because I'm in love with her?
Yes!
Wow. Aah! So romantic!
Loving it!
Taking a risk. Go get her, baby!
I know I confused you.
I just had to make sure.
For my wife and for my kids.
And for your kids.
And for you.
Just so we have no lies.
It was me who drank your beer at Hooters.
I don't know why I did that. I get free beers there so it was just panic then.
Yeah?
This is 323, right?
Yeah.
I was looking for Lauren.
You and me both.
Jim!
Big time! Look at you!
Mom's not home. This is my dad.
Mark.
Yeah.
Who are you?
Jim! The cool guy from the safari.
Do you wanna "bowl" me a few pitches?
I'm sure your father wants to do that with you.
No, he doesn't.
No, no, no, no. Go get your bat, big time.
Hey! We can all play!
I'll get Brendan's glove.
Boy, he hasn't shut up about that Africa trip.
Your kids are incredible.
Yeah.
That's why Lauren and I are, you know, trying to make things work again.
For them.
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah. I'll tell her you came by.
And I'll put these in the bedroom next to where we make love.
Okay.
Tell Tyler I said goodbye.
Where's Jim going?
He had stuff to do, I guess.
- Can you and me play then?
- Yeah, of Co...
Ooh. Saved by the bell.
Hey, what's up?
You busy?
- Hi. - Hi.
Is there a GQ photo shoot going on here?
No. I'm just... I'm just chilling.
I'm sorry that took so long.
Thank you for watching after the boys.
I'm done now and I'm guessing you have somewhere you gotta go so...
How do you always look so great?
Yeah? It's my haven't-washed-my-hair-in-three-days look.
Thanks for noticing.
Heh. You're so funny.
It's hard for me to imagine you with someone else.
Really? It wasn't hard for you to imagine yourself with someone else when you cheated on me.
You always bring it back to that.
I could say, "Hey, look at that house."
And you'd say, "We lived in a house when you cheated on me."
Or I could say, "Pass that pickle." And you could say, I don't know.
Something about a pickle and you cheating on me.
It's fun to laugh with you again, Lauren.
We used to do that all the time.
You brought flowers?
Yeah.
Why'd you bring flowers?
Because you deserve flowers.
Lauren, when you went away to Africa, I did a lot of thinking.
You and I, we have so much history together.
Two boys. One receptionist.
Look, I made a mistake!
You made it at least four mistakes that I know of.
Made. Past tense.
I was a jerk.
Lauren, you were the best thing in my life.
You and the boys.
And boys need their fathers.
They do.
I know that I'm a good father.
I just need to prove it to them.
Well, you can!
It's not too late.
Is it too late for this?
What are you doing?
I'm coming home, baby.
Mark! Get off of me!
You don't live here anymore!
Is there someone else?
And that's none of your business anyway.
You're interested in being a good father?
Tyler has a game on Saturday.
Dad?
I didn't mean to wake you.
I was talking to Mom before bed.
And she says she has a lot of stuff to do.
She does?
Yeah. So she might not be able to hang around as much.
Okay.
She also said you need to increase my allowance to 5 dollars.
She's very generous.
I just...
I don't want her to disappear.
Sweetheart, she's never gonna disappear.
Never ever.
You can let her go.
She will always be right here.
And I will always be here.
I promise you.
By the way Mom loved the Africa trip.
So did I.
I miss her.
Your mother was the greatest.
I mean Lauren.
Me too.
We don't have to let go of her too, do we?
Come here.
Brendan, don't forget that I'm picking you up for Scouts so don't take the bus home.
Thanks for telling everyone I'm still in Scouts, Mom.
You're a good boy. Be proud of who you are.
Love you.
Say one word and you're dead.
You're driving a minivan.
It's Dick's.
I'm off to buy toilet paper for Team Theodopolis.
When the team needs toilet paper, the Co-captain goes and gets it.
And believe me, those kids never stop crapping.
Kids need to crap.
You need anything from Walmart?
I'm good.
- See you at the PTA meeting.
- Okay, foxy.
Yeah!
Base on!
This is so good, honey.
- This is family.
- This is fun for me.
- Way to go, Dad.
- One out to go.
But Standard Fence has a rally going.
Now batting, number 23, Tyler Reynolds.
- Hey, that's not nice!
- Shut up. That kid's awful.
Go Tyler!
Tracy.
What's your head doing here?
Strike one!
I'm so sorry Mark didn't show up.
He just doesn't get it, you know?
Your kids have to come first 100 percent of the time.
Well, like, 99 percent.
You get one percent for yourself.
- That's great news.
- Heh. Well, no matter what, you have to show up for your kids.
Like him.
- Hey, hey!
All right, big time! - Come on, Tyler!
Looking good out there!
Get that elbow up!
Elbow up!
Incredible.
Come on, Tyler.
Strike two!
All right, all right!
Nice cut, nice cut. Slow it down a little bit.
Bend those knees. Balance, okay?
