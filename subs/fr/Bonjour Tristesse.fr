Wait till they see these.
If they like the others, they'll be crazy about these.
- Like to look at them?
- I'll see them at the show.
This is the best day of my life.
I have my first exhibition and I have you.
Cecile, will you marry me when I'm a success?
Let's give ourselves a little time.
Cecile!
- Aren't you interested in anything?
- Yes, in going someplace else.
- Where?
- I don't know.
- Alone?
- Yes, alone.
- There.
We're engaged.
- I don't want that.
All right.
Then we're engaged.
It's going to be a small wedding, but you may come.
- Will I see you later?
- Yes.
Where?
I don't know.
I'll be ready in three seconds.
- Any zipping or buttoning to do?
- No thanks, darling. It's all done.
- Are we calling for Yvette?
- She's no longer with us.
It's Denise.
- Model? - Actress.
Aspiring.
Rather appetizing.
Talented too, she says.
- The usual trinket? - Not this time.
It's pretty, though.
- I'll see it later on Denise.
Jacques, there she is now.
Cecile?
- Hello.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- I love your dress.
Is it new? - Thank you.
You look adorable.
- Raymond.
- And this is Denise... Denise.
- How do you do?
- Good evening.
Cecile, this is Jacques, who's dying to meet you.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Have a drink?
- I'd love one.
- I've waited a long time to meet you.
- I'm very flattered.
Now, I'm gonna sit here.
Denise?
You sit there.
Deanne there.
Paulette here.
Cecile...
That's not gonna work.
Let's dance in the meantime.
- May I take you to the races tomorrow?
- I'd love to go.
Thank you, Jacques.
After the races he'll tak e me to dinner and dancing again.
And on Thursday to the tennis matches.
And on Sunday to the country.
What a waste of time, dear Jacques.
What a hopeless waste of time.
He's attractive.
And he's nice.
And I'd lik e to warn him but he wouldn't understand that I can't feel anything he might be interested in because I'm surrounded by a wall.
Hey, how about a dance?
- Half a dance.
- Better than none.
- He likes you.
- He's very charming.
- How's Denise?
- Great girl.
- This is gonna be a fun evening.
- Yes, wonderful.
It's wonderful luck having you for a daughter.
The luck runs both ways, sir.
But even with my father it isn't the same anymore.
Nothing is.
Will I ever be happy again as I was at the beginning of that wonderful summer on the Riviera just a year ago?
Seven was my magic number.
I was very superstitious then, and loved it.
Seven and three.
The seven came out of my age, 17.
And the three from the three members of our very happy household.
Good morning, Albertine.
My coffee, please.
Albertine has the sunstroke.
I'm her sister, Léontine.
So you are.
Good morning, Léontine.
Is she very ill?
- You know how it is.
- I know how it is.
- Good morning, Alber...
- Albertine has the sunstroke.
- This is her sister, Léontine.
- I thought I felt a change.
Forgive me.
My sister told me what to expect.
Good morning, monsieur.
I don't think she approves.
- They lack imagination down here.
- More likely they have too much.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Did you wake well?
I never do and you always do.
It's repulsively unfair.
- Just you wait till you're my age.
- How's Elsa?
She's asleep.
Look at that wonderful sea.
- High time we threw ourselves in.
- All that vitality.
Elsa?
- Twice more.
- Why?
Three times is good luck.
- Pebbles and all?
- Of course.
Elsa?
Elsa?
If you really want it to work, do it seven times.
If I want that, I'll pull her out by the hair.
Wait.
Let's smell the day.
Good morning, Cecile.
Good morning, Raymond.
I'm up now.
Two letters for you.
One's from your office.
Throw it away.
It's vacation time.
It doesn't say who this one's from. Look, not bad.
Another week, it'll be flatter than yours.
But you're tempting the devil looking in the mirror before noon.
Do I look that much fatter in the morning?
It has nothing to do with that.
It's bad luck, that's all.
- Why?
- It just is.
You'll see.
- I'm asleep.
- Then wake up.
- It's the middle of the night.
- It's morning.
- It's raining.
- No, it isn't.
It is. Great big drops.
I heard them on the door.
- How do you feel?
- As if I were swimming in sizzling oil.
You do look like a lobster.
You were too lazy to move out of the sun.
If you really adored me, you would have moved the sun.
I adore you, all right.
- Good morning, Elsa.
- Good morning, Raymond.
- Up.
- Don't make me move, I'll crack.
- But you can't lie here all day.
- Why not?
- Good morning, Elsa.
- Good morning.
I wish you would explain to your father...
- Is that my new pin?
- Pretty, I think.
Off with it.
- I thought we were friends.
- So did I. But then you let him come in here before I've washed my face.
I am going to crack.
Curiously, you look very appetizing. Even with an unwashed face.
Thank you, darling.
I have cracked.
- Where? - Here.
Now I'm getting peely.
- I'll be ugly. You'll hate me.
- I can't stand that moaning.
- Where are you going?
- To sleep in the sea.
- You sleep there, I'll sleep here. - You can't go back to sleep.
- Raymond, no.
- You be careful.
She is sunburned.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
Now, the rain from heaven, if you please.
None left.
You'll have to go in yourself.
Marvellous, Raymond. It's like swimming in cool velvet.
- Velvet's always hot.
- Cool silk, then.
- Know where I'd like to be this minute?
- Exactly where you are.
You're exactly right.
Hey, out of my way.
There's work to be done.
Look.
The lobster lady approaches.
Guess who?
- Marvellous. She really is a good sport.
- She is.
- I'm glad you like her.
- It's easy.
She's fun and she's unpretentious.
I'm glad you scuttled Yvonne Marie before summer.
I wouldn't have brought her here.
If you'd met her in April, you would've.
That's why I met her in November.
I would kiss you for the umbrella, Raymond, but you are in the sun.
- I mixed three lotions in one jar, Elsa.
- Brilliant.
I don't guarantee they'll stop the peeling.
I'm in no condition to ask for a guarantee on anything.
All the way down here I've been brain-rattling.
- Seriously? - Yes.
Cecile, which would you rather have, jewels or furs?
Neither.
Jewellery's supposed to be a good investment.
And of course, you can wear it all year round.
But furs feel so good under bare feet.
Are you planning another birthday?
No.
And I'm not being hinty either.
I was just wondering.
You see, when we go to the casino Friday night...
I look like a piece of old wallpaper.
And I win a lot of money again. Where is my comb?
There might be one in the pocket of this shirt.
After all, I won quite a bit last Friday.
And if I win quite a bit this Friday... Thank you.
You still haven't opened your letter.
I was wondering what I ought to give myself for a present.
What happens if you lose?
But I never lose, Raymond.
You know that. I can't.
That horoscope Cecile got for me says I was born lucky and...
Where is she going?
- Will he drown? - No, of course not, darling.
- What makes you think it's a "he"?
- Why else would she run?
- You all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.
- My, but you're polite.
- I'm sorry.
Need some help?
- May I tie her onto your float?
- Sure.
I'll help.
My mother has a house on the other side of the rocks.
I'm spending my vacation there.
- Vacation from what?
- Law school.
- Do you really mean to be a lawyer?
- Why else go to law school?
Well, one has to do something until one reaches a certain age.
- One has to prepare for the future.
- I'm preparing.
- How?
- By learning how to have a good time.
That's not a very...
- You're terribly serious, aren't you?
- Yes, I am serious.
- How marvellous.
- Why?
- I don't know any serious people.
- How peculiar.
That's my father there with a friend of ours.
- Yes, I know.
- You do? How?
- You've seen us at the casino.
- No.
No, you're too serious to go there.
In the village?
- I've never seen any of you.
- Then you've heard about us. You heard about those wicked people from Paris.
- I'm from Paris.
- You heard and were intrigued.
You're corruptible.
I'm just interested in people, that's all.
Well, it was very nice of you to help me.
- I didn't mean to embarrass you.
- You didn't.
Or shock you.
- lf you'd like to come sailing...
- I'd love it, but I don't know how.
I'll teach you.
I think you could do with a lesson yourself.
I'm an excellent sailor.
The mast broke. - Come on.
- Where?
Don't you want to meet the wicked people from Paris?
Do you think I upset him?
You hop subjects like a roulette ball.
Upset who?
- That sailor boat boy.
What's his name?
- Philippe.
It's torture to wear clothes with a sunburn.
I think I did upset him. Was I too open about us?
He didn't need quite so much help in adding one and one.
Anyway, he's brilliantly cute.
- Why didn't Cecile ask him to dinner?
- She did for tomorrow.
- I would have asked for tonight.
- I'm sure.
Why waste time?
This was found in the pocket of your shirt.
Thank you.
- Could I have more coffee, please?
- Yes, mademoiselle.
She thinks she's being insulting with that "mademoiselle."
I love it.
I'm not old enough to be madame, am I? Cecile?
I'm listening to the crickets.
But they only say the same thing over and over.
I read they make that noise by rubbing their legs together.
What a thought.
I have a surprise.
Company is coming.
- Brilliant.
Anybody I know?
- Anne Larsen.
This dress is her design.
- Coming here?
When?
- Next week.
- Raymond, is Anne Larsen married?
- She's divorced.
Why?
- How old is she?
- She's older than you are.
She was my mother's best friend.
She must be a very lovely lady.
- Your thoughts are so hard to follow.
- Be careful of my back.
I just have to get out of this dress.
Your crickets are having a cocktail party.
- Raymond. - Now please, don't bawl me out.
- May I ask a question?
- No.
- What made you invite Anne?
- You like Anne.
I do. Very much. But we hardly ever see her anymore.
- I see her all the time.
- Occasionally.
At large parties.
Last time we had a long chat at a comparatively small cocktail party.
What?
I know you and the invitations you hand out at parties.
- To be honest, I forgot I'd invited her.
- You're awful.
How did you happen to ask her anyway?
She looked particularly attractive.
She's always seemed so aloof and self-assured.
I wouldn't think she would vacation here. How did you get her to accept?
- No one's told you I'm charming?
- Everyone but Anne.
You should ask her now. I reminded her she's practically your godmother and hasn't seen you.
I can hear it all:
"Anne, Cecile is no longer a child.
She's a young girl now.
I try to be both parents to her, but she needs the help of a woman.
The women I know..."
That's marvellous.
I should be taking lessons from you.
Raymond? Did you tell her about Elsa?
- Elsa?
- Oh, Raymond.
I don't think I knew that Elsa was coming when I asked Anne.
Anne said she'd think it over and... Oh, dear.
Raymond? Which room is Anne going to have?
I thought I'd give her mine.
- I'll sleep in the bathhouse.
- I will.
- The ladies here, the gentleman there.
- You're worried about appearances?
- I'm a bundle of surprises tonight.
- You're impossible. So is the situation.
She's arriving on Monday.
So you can either spank me, walk out or help me.
- You know I'll help you.
- I suspected you might.
You're such a fake.
It's such wonderful fun to have you for a daughter.
Hey, what's the matter?
I don't want it to stop. Ever.
But suddenly somehow I knew it would stop. That our happy days were numbered.
That was a Tuesday.
Anne was due the following Monday.
Six more days.
I remember thinking seven would have been lucky.
It was very hot the day Anne was to arrive.
My father and Elsa went to meet her at the station.
They're back.
Anne!
Welcome.
Thank you, Cecile.
Are you that grown up?
- Really, welcome.
- And really, thank you.
- Which way?
- Terrace first, so you can see the view.
- How did your new collection go?
- Extremely well.
But I wish I could have found material the colour of this water.
I spent my honeymoon by the sea.
Twelve years ago.
Did you like it?
I mean the place?
Yes, I liked both it and the place.
Although it wasn't nearly as lovely as this.
I had quite a debate with myself before coming here.
- I'm delighted I lost.
- I'll fetch your things.
- What's the matter, Cecile?
- Nothing.
Why?
- You're embarrassed.
- There's nothing.
May I guess? You're annoyed Raymond isn't here to spread a welcome carpet.
He's spreading it with flowers.
He's spreading it at the station.
But I wired I was driving.
- You wired? - Yes.
I wouldn't decide to drive and not send word.
Where do you suppose that telegram is?
In his pocket, unopened.
Albertine!
I mean, Léontine!
Slight maid problem. Weird sisters rotate working for us.
Weird?
How?
Every week one or the other is stricken with some odd malady.
Maybe it's us.
- Yes?
- Léontine...
Léontine has a bad liver.
I am her sister, Claudine.
- Did a telegram come today?
- I handed it to monsieur myself.
- Didn't he read it?
- Do you know him, madame?
- Would you take my bags to my room?
- Yes, madame.
- Where is my room?
- This way.
Poor Raymond. For once he's a victim of his irresponsibility.
- Serves him right.
- No, not on such a hot day.
How I'd love to resist opening telegrams. To not answer phones. To do exactly what I intend to do here.
- What? - Nothing.
Oh, what a lovely room.
Raymond picked the flowers and cut them himself. And even arranged them himself. Isn't he sweet?
He can be very endearing, can't he?
At least the weird sisters clean well.
You're looking wonderfully well.
I'm surprised and pleased.
- Why surprised?
- From Raymond's description...
That was in Paris.
I was worn out from studying.
- How did you do with examinations?
- Flunked.
- Flunked?
- Flunked.
- Would you like me to unpack for you?
- No, thank you.
- The box is for you.
- Oh, Anne.
- Are you studying now?
- During vacation?
You'll take examinations again in October. Why?
Raymond never got a diploma.
Yes, but he worked hard. Made quite a bit of money.
If it's gone, I'm sure there'll always be a man to take care of me.
And you don't need a diploma for that.
I don't like vulgarities, Cecile. Even when they're funny.
I'm sorry.
The dress is marvellous.
- It's really marvellous.
- But?
No, the style is too.
Everything you design is perfect.
But you think that's too young for you?
You're wrong.
A more sophisticated style would only make you look more of a child.
I'm not a child.
You're not going to make me study, are you?
I didn't know I could.
Well, you could.
Don't be so afraid of me.
I'm not here as your governess.
I won't make you do anything.
Although I might try to influence you a little.
Even a scale.
Well, that'll ruin my appetite.
That's Raymond's.
- Did he give up this room for me?
- I offered to move out of mine.
It's odd a villa this size has only two bedrooms.
- There are three.
- Three?
Yes, this one and two upstairs.
Mine and Elsa's.
Elsa Mackenbourg. I think you met her.
Not too bright but a lot of fun.
Just what does he think I am?
He sleeps in the bathhouse.
He can sleep here, because I won't.
Or any other place else that he...
Cecile, would you mind leaving me alone?
No.
Cecile?
- Cecile?
- Yes, Raymond.
She wasn't there.
You suppose she fell out of the train?
- She's here. She drove. - You see?
I told you Philippe didn't have an American car.
Must have been 190 degrees in the shade.
My pathetic feet.
- Where is Anne?
- In her room.
- Any point in taking these to her?
- I wouldn't disturb her now.
- Oh?
- Yes.
- Was she...? - Very.
Very what?
You two don't even need words.
The perfect marriage.
- How bad?
- Breakage.
- Really bad.
You suppose the setup...?
- No, she's too sophisticated.
- Discovering occupied territory?
- Couldn't care less.
- You think. - I know.
Know what about Anne?
Anne is fine. And delighted to be here.
Forgive me.
I stood on that platform for hours waving these.
- I should have telephoned.
- What's the difference?
We're all here.
- I'm here.
I'm Elsa Mackenbourg.
- I thought you knew each other.
Not as well as I'd like to.
Pretty dress.
Not as pretty as some of yours I've got.
They are just brilliant.
You're kind.
But the line of that suits you.
The colour is good when I'm not half peeling.
I have lotion that will help on my dressing table.
I'm going to sink in the water and drown in the sun.
- I'll show you the way.
- I can see the way.
Straight down.
I'm going to put that lotion on right this minute.
If that woman says it will help, it will help.
She's brilliant.
- Amazing figure. - Never mind that.
- I thought she said...
- What?
- She was leaving.
- What is going on?
- I haven't a clue.
- We'd better find out.
- What's so funny?
- Your face.
I could almost see you figuring out something to say.
It's not too easy.
When I invited you, I had no idea Elsa...
- No explanations.
- I want to.
Explanations only make things more complicated.
- They certainly do.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- I'm sorry, darling.
- As long as you're staying.
- I don't know that I am.
- I don't know where we are.
I got stupidly angry before and decided to leave. Then the prospect of packing again and looking for a hotel was too much.
- So you decided to stay.
- Overnight.
- I thought...
- Then, if I'm staying overnight...
- Might as well spend the holiday. - Yes.
If I find that I like it.
- She'll be gone in two days.
- No, she'll stay.
How can you be so sure?
I know women.
I know how to make them like it.
- You want her to stay?
Yes, I want her to stay.
She has an amazingly good figure.
Anne stayed.
And we lik ed it.
All three of us.
And the maids as well.
She ran them.
She ran the house.
She ran us.
- This is my dance.
- It doesn't seem to be.
She made everything so easy for us that we wondered how we had ever managed without her.
And we made everything such fun for her.
We did have fun then.
And everyone was so nice to everyone else.
Anne? Anne?
- We thought you deserted us. - Never.
We ordered for you.
- Where's Elsa?
- She's dancing with Pierre Shube.
- He's a marvellous dancer.
- Or as Elsa would say:
Brilliant.
How can you all sit with that brilliant music?
It's made me forget the last of my sunburn.
- Where's your friend?
- Leading the band.
- Come on, let's get with it.
- No, Elsa.
It's so easy, Raymond.
Just wiggle.
Put it out here and put it back there.
Look at them.
It's wonderful.
Come on, then.
- Come on, Philippe.
- It's useless.
If you can teach me to sail, I can teach you to wiggle.
Put it out here and put it back there.
Wiggle, wiggle.
Brilliant.
Wiggle.
Wiggle.
I'm getting dizzy!
- Better? - Better.
It should have been someone's birthday.
- It was. - Whose?
Anne's.
I feel as if it was.
What a lovely, lovely evening.
- I thank you.
- And we thank you.
It seems you're always having birthdays here.
Not always.
It's really rather recent.
Cecile, isn't it time you were in bed?
- Yes.
- I think it's time we were all in bed.
Oh, Anne?
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
- Good night, Raymond. - Good night.
Good night, darling.
Very funny.
- Why do they fall off so much?
- Anne never skied before this summer.
I'm beginning to think he makes her fall off.
All that fooling around in the water.
Even I could get back up on skis quicker.
And this sudden interest he has in going to the market.
Every time she goes, he goes.
Yesterday it took all afternoon to buy two chickens.
Don't tell me it takes one afternoon to buy two chickens.
- They weren't even very good, either.
- They've known each other 15 years.
With your father, nobody's safe.
Anne could never be seriously interested in a man like him.
I know women.
And if a man finds the right way at the right moment...
Look.
I know I'm going to...!
My horoscope knows more than your law books.
It says tonight is my night and I'm going to win at the casino.
- Bravo.
- There is a new moon and the casino is starting a new game tonight.
The craps.
When did your eager little fingers learn to hold dice?
There was this spooky American named Lucky something...
I can see it all.
I don't know. There isn't a three or seven in today's date.
Seven times two is 14.
- But today is the fifteenth.
- Not in China.
There's nothing like this Chinese champagne.
Or French laundry.
You're getting giggly.
If we don't go to the casino now, you'll fall fat on your flaces.
- Fat on your flace.
- No, fat on your flace.
- After you. - After you.
Oh, come on.
Seven again.
You must have driven like a maniac.
Eleven.
Seven.
You won, madame.
- My dear, may I ride on you?
- Tonight is my night.
Ride away.
Baby needs shoes.
Seven again.
Cecile, it's jewels and furs for everybody.
- Two and two says she does.
- Won't come.
She's three and one.
Have you any sporting blood? - Mother.
- Hello, Philippe.
Cecile, my dear.
What are you doing here?
I found a new game, and it enchants my blood.
And this friend of yours... Or of your father's?
She's brilliant.
No dice.
Marvellous mind.
Brain of a mathematical genius.
- Who, Elsa? - She never loses.
- Eleven.
- You see?
Here and this back here.
And this here.
And here and here and here.
- Victory!
- Victory!
- Brilliant.
- Brilliant.
A very old friend, Pablo de L'Amo.
Hello, querida.
Hello, querido.
Hello from America.
Not North America, South America.
Drinks, querido!
Drinks and champagne.
- He's a wee bit tipsy-poo.
- He's very drunky-poo.
Very drunk because I'm very rich.
Very rich because I'm very smart.
Very smart because I made it all myself in...
My beautiful, Elsa, what did I make it in?
- Money!
- Right!
He's drunk on champagne, I'm drunk on gambling.
You two aren't drunk.
That's not very brilliant.
Not brilliant at all.
- Where is Raymond?
- Dancing, probably.
- Brilliant girl. - Brilliant.
And very right.
You two are not drunk on anything.
Very bad.
To live, you must be drunk on something. Love.
Money. Success. Failure.
- You're drunk, but you're right.
- Of course I am. I'm rich.
Or maybe it's the other way around.
- Do you always have such a good time? - Always.
Except when I'm in America.
- Not North America. - South America.
You tell someone you're rich and from America and they always think you are from Texas.
They are not dancing anywhere.
My beautiful girl you are very beautiful.
Also, you are very sunburned. Also, you are very peeling.
Be quiet, Pablo.
I couldn't find them anyplace.
- Drink your champagne, Elsa.
- Drink my champagne, Elsa.
- Lucky in cards, unlucky in...
- You're too beautiful to be unlucky.
- Shall I go look? - I'll look.
Anne isn't used to champagne.
She probably needed air.
- Stop worrying, Elsa.
- Stop worrying, Elsa.
"Isn't used to champagne." She can drink like a man.
- Then I want to meet her.
- Be still, Pablo.
But it is summer, Raymond and I'm as suspicious of summer as I am of you.
You said I behave like a boy.
How can you be suspicious of a boy? - Easily.
He likes to play with girls.
- That's true. Until now.
- Now you're serious?
- From the moment you arrived.
From the moment I arrived, you've been campaigning.
- And what about Elsa?
- Elsa? You know how I think of Elsa.
- As a playmate for Cecile. - Exactly.
I could never think of you as just a playmate.
- Not even for you?
- The moment I stop joking, you start.
But that's what you want, isn't it?
A playmate, someone to have fun with?
I do have fun with you.
And that's a long way from being all I want.
And we've been over and over this.
I know.
Raymond, I cannot be casual.
I've never been less casual in my life.
- Then why am I still so frightened?
- I don't know.
I'm often frightened when I want something badly.
And I want you.
I've never wanted any woman the way I want you.
No, Raymond.
Raymond, no.
Part of me was angry. Part of me was happy.
All of me was excited.
He had brought a girl to the seashore, made her go out in the sun then when she was a mess of peeling, dropped her ilk e a hot lobster.
It was unfair.
Yet even while I was angry at him I was proud that he had gotten the unattainable Anne.
How long would it last?
Well, how long did Elsa last?
How long did any of them last?
Anne wasn't feeling well.
My father had to take her home.
They have gone? Yes.
How about a drink?
- No, thank you. - No, thank you.
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thank you.
She was awfully sick, Elsa.
She ruined that beautiful dress.
It was a horrible, frumpy dress.
- We were all so happy.
- So happy.
- We can still be happy, Elsa.
- No, we can't.
- No, we can't.
- Be still, Pablo.
- Come on, we'll take you home. - I have no home.
I'm not going back.
- Elsa, be reasonable.
- I will not be treated like a wife.
Pablo will find me a hotel.
I'll buy you a hotel.
Goodbye, Philippe.
- You liked me, didn't you?
- I still do, Elsa.
We were good friends, weren't we?
I'll see you, Elsa.
Never.
Never again.
Never again.
Poor Elsa. I feel as though I were losing a good friend.
- I'm confused. Know what I'd like to do?
- What?
I'd like to go someplace alone with you and get very drunky-poo.
Philippe, you'll be a credit to your mother yet.
- Good morning, mademoiselle.
- Good morning, Albertine.
Holy Buddha!
You are Albertine.
Come and sit with us.
Appearances indicate you stopped for a nightcap.
- A whole hat.
- Is that ice cream?
- It's vanilla.
Her hangover cure.
- It works. - Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Cecile.
- Good morning, Anne.
You both look so mysterious. As if you had a secret.
- Well...
- Have you a cigarette?
- I'll get one. Don't bother, because I don't really want one.
We would like to ask you something.
Elsa's in a hotel.
Some South American was taking care of her.
- No, no, it's not that.
- What, then?
- Your father and I want to get married.
- We'd like it very much.
Well, it's a good idea. It's a very good idea.
Glad that's over.
I told you she'd be pleased.
- Of course I am.
- I wasn't sure.
- You never believe me.
- Yes, I do.
Now that the approval's official, we'll celebrate.
Champagne? Or ice cream?
May I have both?
You can have anything you want.
- You are pleased?
- Yes.
But confused?
It's just hard for me to smile too much with this head.
- Is that really all?
Does our getting married seem strange to you or just ridiculous?
- Not ridiculous at all.
- But strange?
- A little.
Say it. Say anything, Cecile. I want you to.
I have to kind of push everything around to think of Raymond married.
You didn't want him to marry again?
No, I mean, I didn't think he wanted to.
But if he does, I do.
If he's glad, I'm glad.
That makes me so happy.
You know, I was rather frightened of you.
Of me?
Why? I was afraid of your being frightened of me.
I was. Until just this minute.
- Well, never be again.
- I won't. I've told Albertine the news.
- That is Albertine, isn't it?
- Yes. Anyway, I told her the news. And she's happier than we are.
I think we've seen the last of her sisters.
You see, you make everybody happy.
- Doesn't she, Cecile?
Did I really believe that?
Well, at least I tried to. And I tried to live as though it were true. As though the subtle but swift changes Anne made in our daily life made me happy too.
It isn't that I don't believe your father has changed.
I want too much to believe it. What difference could a change in him mean to you?
If he changes, you change.
If he's happy with one person...
Raymond is happy with Anne.
It's different than with Elsa or with...
He loves Anne. And he wants the kind of life she wants.
You've seen them.
Belonging to one person can make you happy.
Anne is different too.
She looks softer. She moves easier.
- In the morning, she seems...
As though she had the most wonderful secret in the world.
I wish I walked the way she walks now. I wish I had the look she has. I wish...
You said we weren't to do this anymore.
I don't care.
Cecile!
I think perhaps you had better go, Philippe.
- You got the wrong impressión.
There... - I think you'd better go.
You realize that such diversions can end up in a hospital.
We were only kissing. That won't end up in any hospital.
- Please don't see him again, Cecile.
- What if I say I love him?
I don't think you do, darling.
Love doesn't depend on that. Nor is it the only way to express it.
But I enjoy Philippe and I want to see him.
And I feel a great responsibility towards you now.
- I cannot allow you to ruin your life.
- Are you ruining yours?
Your father and I are going to be married.
Also, I am not 17.
Seventeen now isn't what it was when you were 17.
I'm not a child, Anne. And I won't be treated like one.
I don't want you to see Philippe again, Cecile.
You will have studying to do.
That will keep you busy in the afternoons.
My father tells me what to do, not you.
I suppose she told you.
- She tells me, and I adore listening.
- You know what I mean.
- I never know what anybody means.
I'm sorry.
We were only kissing, and Anne thought...
I didn't.
I simply feel it would be good if she stopped seeing Philippe and studied for her philosophy examination.
Couldn't she do both?
Philippe is well-behaved.
Not a good sense of humour, but nice.
I like him.
Cecile is nice and I like her, but they have nothing to do.
We have a great deal to do.
We play tennis, go sailing, swimming and skin-diving.
Healthy things.
Physical things.
If anything happened, you couldn't really blame them.
- Yes, I see what you mean.
- You do? You should do some work.
You don't want to fail philosophy and take it over.
I couldn't care less and neither could you.
Cecile, would it be so hard to study just for a few weeks?
- Yes. Very hard.
- Cecile.
- Are you siding with her or me?
- It's not a question of sides.
Isn't it? I want to see Philippe and not be cooped up studying.
Anne wants me to study and not see Philippe.
What shall it be?
Because I love Anne doesn't mean that I love you any less.
That's not an answer.
Well, I think for the next few weeks you should study and not see Philippe.
She's prim and prissy and prude. And a know-it-all and I hate her.
She's changed him.
She'll change me.
She'll change everything.
I hate her.
I hate her.
I hate her.
No, it isn't her fault he doesn't love you anymore.
It's yours. You're spoiled and wilful and arrogant and lazy. A mean little monster.
Anne had made me look at myself for the first time in my life. And that turned me against her. Dead against her.
I'll be with you in a moment, Jacques.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not angry.
Then why are you leaving?
I don't really know.
You go to a place, you leave a place.
- But he's not for you.
- Who is? Not him, at any rate.
Where do you live, Hubert?
Where do I live?
You know where I live.
You know where I live?
Limbo. With my father.
There's Jacques.
What happened?
I thought you weren't gonna show.
You know better than that.
- This evening you're very peculiar.
- I'm a very peculiar girl.
- You're my girl, aren't you?
- Yes, Raymond. I'm your girl.
- We have great fun, don't we?
- Yes, we have great fun.
Does he really still have fun?
I know he wants to desperately.
And I knew he wouldn't have much with Anne.
Which was probably another reason I decided to get rid of her.
How carefully, how seriously I went about that decisión.
What a little beast.
While pretending to study I actually spent days comparing the contestants for my father. Comparing Anne and me.
All our good points, against all our bad ones.
I meant to be fair, but the score was against me. Definitely.
Anne was out. How to get her out might have been difficult if the way, the trap, had not been opened for me.
Come in, Albertine.
Elsa? What's happened to you?
I'm tan, all over.
Don't I look brilliant?
- Absolutely.
And a new dress?
- Several new dresses, shoes and bags.
- From your gambling money?
- No, from Pablo. For my birthday.
I thought you had that birthday three months ago.
I did. But he was in America then.
South America.
Pablo said to leave my old things here, but I'm sentimental.
I packed everything myself.
- How is Raymond?
- Miserable.
Really?
Well, he is, but he doesn't know it yet.
She doesn't give him a chance to know it.
She's very clever.
Brilliant.
You don't know how clever. He's agreed to marry her.
- Marry?
Raymond is going to marry?
- Yes.
- It serves him right.
- How can you say that?
- He threw me out.
- You walked out.
He dumped me at the casino.
No lady goes home alone.
- You had me and Philippe.
- I have my pride.
And Pablo.
Pablo.
He drinks and laughs and drinks...
- Elsa, it's fate.
- I hate fate. That stupid horoscope...
It's fate that you walked in here. I was thinking about you.
Really?
What? I was thinking how Raymond still loves you.
- Cecile.
- Deep down he loves you. You know it.
Yes, he loves me so madly, he's going to marry Anne.
It's the idea of marriage that appeals to him.
You think so?
- He always wants to try something new.
- But he has been married.
Yes, but so long ago he's forgotten he didn't like it.
- lf he marries again, he's ruined.
- So are you. I know.
I wish you wanted to help.
What can I do?
It's too late.
I walked out when I should have stayed.
- Where are you going?
- Back to Cannes.
- Must you?
- No.
Do you want to?
No. I love Raymond. I'd still be here if it weren't for that scheming...
That's what she is. Scheming.
- Ask Philippe's mother if you can stay.
- I can. She thinks I'm brilliant.
But why?
- Say you don't have a place to stay.
- Yes, but why go at all?
I have an idea.
It isn't worked out yet and there isn't time to explain.
- But Cecile...?
- Do you want Raymond back?
- You know I do.
- Then hurry to Philippe's.
- Do you have a car?
- Yes.
Pablo was...
You drive.
I'll walk and meet you there.
- Why don't you come with me?
- I don't want them to see us together.
Besides, I have to work out my plan.
That means concentration and being alone.
Now, hurry. Go the back way.
All right.
Cecile.
- What now?
- I feel so good.
- Cecile? Cecile?
Where are you going? - For a walk in the woods.
You've been working so hard. Relax.
Go and take a swim.
- No, thank you.
- I'll come.
The water's very watery.
I have to concentrate. I'm working out a problem. In philosophy.
Now surely philosophy can wait.
Not Pascal.
He's demanding. You want me to meet his demands, don't you?
Any man would wait while you took a swim.
Not this one.
- Did Elsa come...?
- Let's get married.
- It's an epidemic.
- I'm serious.
- You're only a boy.
I only look like a boy. I'm 25.
- Where's Elsa?
Did your mother...?
- I love you. I'm proposing.
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer because it's no.
I didn't answer because Anne would answer for me, and she'd say no.
- Can't we get rid of Anne?
- That's why I sent Elsa down here.
Then you do love me?
I don't quite get the connection, but, yes, I do.
Where's Elsa?
She's watching Mother play bridge.
- She told Mother she was an orphan.
- Why? She thought it was a good touch.
Everybody feels sorry for orphans.
- I feel rather sorry for Elsa.
- Why the change?
I didn't realize Anne was such an adventuress or that Elsa was so sensitive.
So much imagination, you mean.
Collect your tiny brain and try and do better this time.
- One small diamante.
- Two clubs.
- Pass.
- Pass?
Pass.
- Two hearts.
- Three diamantes.
- Pass.
- Pass.
- Pass.
- Three hearts.
Three hearts?
We're on the brink of a tantalizing abyss.
Do I jump or not?
- Three hearts?
- What? What?
Tune that thing up. She's only repeating your pathetic bid.
Stop semaphoring.
Either come in or go out.
- I say jump.
- I'm with you.
Come back at 5.
My partner has to go. You and I will sweep the field.
- Where can we talk?
- My room. I can't wait to hear your plan.
I'm all goose-pimply.
- I don't like intrigue.
- I do. - You want to marry me.
- What's that have to do with it?
- Would Anne let me marry you?
- No. The plan concerns getting rid of Anne. Anne concerns us.
- I still don't like it.
- I love it.
- You haven't even heard it yet.
- Will you two be still?
The basic idea is wildly simple.
The details may take a bit of working out.
Is that your room?
You two must pretend to be madly in love.
We have to arrange that my father sees you together.
- Jealousy, the green-eyed monster.
- Now, wait, Cecile.
You wait. And let me explain.
Krishnimara, aid me.
Concentration is the secret.
Exhale deeply.
Exhale from the mind.
Exhale from the soul.
Now, then, suppose I tell Elsa.
No, suppose I tell Philippe.
- Go away, Albertine.
- It isn't Albertine...
Yoga.
Hindu philosophy.
I wasn't aware that yoga was part of your examination.
All those discussions about your paper on Pascal and how difficult Spinoza was for you.
Cecile, have you actually done any studying at all?
In the end, it's your own affair if you fail your examinations but it is another matter when you lie to your father and to me.
Why did you lie?
I really don't understand you at all.
And you never will!
I would like to apologize.
I sometimes forget that you're still a child.
Now, please don't let that word offend you.
It's merely a short way of saying you're still young enough to pattern your behaviour after people older than you.
You mean I'm not to blame for behaving like Raymond?
No, you're not. Or for being influenced by the way he used to live or the friends he, I hope, won't see very much of from now on.
The Lombards, for instance.
They telephoned from their yacht.
They're taking us to dinner and a club Tuesday.
We have to go.
He's your father's business partner.
I think they're very amusing.
They always make me laugh.
There will be risqué stories deliberately in front of you. Helen Lombard will make sly and bitter jokes about her friends and...
Henri will confide in Raymond about his new girl, a model while he rubs your knee under the table. Your knee being younger than mine.
In a few years, the nephew-chauffeur will make off with the car and the latest model will wear Helen's jewellery.
Friends will laugh at them rather than at their jokes.
- At least they're having a good time.
- Are they?
Then why do they drink so much and so often?
Why are they never alone with each other?
In the end, their only memories will be of hangovers.
I have another moral, Anne.
If you can't accept people as they are, give them up.
Don't try to change them.
Besides, it's usually too late.
Why, you're almost as strong as Rene.
Rene, darling, Rene is Helen's new chauffeur.
- And nephew.
- On which side?
On the left side.
It's an American car.
Wicked, but sweet. Don't you think they're sweet?
- Young love in late fall.
- Thank you.
How does little Cecile feel about her father getting married?
Little Cecile feels like having a great big drink.
Of course.
That's why we're here. Waiter?
- We were at a party the other night.
- Fantastic.
- Who's gonna tell this story?
- I am.
Waiter?
You'll never believe the amount of liquor that was consumed.
Isn't that Elsa Mackenbourg over there?
She's grown into a beautiful trick.
- Who is the boy?
- Her nephew.
- Cecile!
- Well, he's young enough.
Everywhere we've been, there they are.
- She's flaunting her achievement.
- I prefer to rise above it.
- It's all so unimportant, Raymond.
- It's disgraceful.
- That boy has a good face.
- And he's a good driver.
You're well rid of him.
Matter of fact, it's indecent.
Anne.
You look particularly lovely tonight.
Thank you.
This is fun. We ought to go for walks more often.
- Those days are over.
- Nonsense.
- Your days with the Lombards are over.
- Putting me out of business?
I meant socially.
Anne doesn't like them.
- She will in time.
- No, she won't.
You know Anne.
- Why don't you like her?
- I do.
You may like her, but you're always squabbling.
You're a little bit like a mother-in-law.
Mother-in-law will just marry earlier. That will solve all the problems.
- You don't have to go that far.
- I exaggerate, and you know it.
But Anne's way of living is better than ours, and I have to face it.
Good, then face it.
It has depth and stability and wholesomeness.
- You make it sound like a terrible bore.
- It's the good life.
Come down off the pulpit.
We know that your life with me has not been suitable for your age or mine.
We've never been bored.
We won't be bored now. Anne's not asking us to go into a convent.
I just came out and you couldn't get in.
That's your opinion.
- lf you want to make her happy...
Then you have to give up our old life.
Don't you think that after a while we can gradually ease into it?
Don't.
Come on.
- That little tramp.
She is. - You threw her out.
- She walked out.
- You behaved abominably to her.
- You enjoy seeing her with Philippe?
- I don't love him.
- That's not the point.
- What is?
The point is, it doesn't make any sense.
With a boy. With a baby.
- I found him attractive.
- lf I wanted her back...
- You couldn't.
- No?
You think I couldn't get her back because he's a few years younger.
What's the enchantment with these woods?
Anne, how old am I?
Old enough to marry me next month. But just barely.
Elsa, what are you done up as?
You're behaving like an amateur spy.
You could've telephoned instead of sending this.
I didn't want anyone to recognize my voice.
- "All's well.
Come." What does it mean?
- It means your plan worked brilliantly.
Raymond telephoned me last night to say he was madly sorry. And that he had behaved like an absolute monster cad.
It was heaven.
He rumbled a lot of divinely sweet things in that way of his. You know, quietly in a low, deep voice as if he were suffering.
- It was shivery.
- I'm sure.
Then he asked me to meet him after lunch to show I had no hard feelings.
- Meet him where?
- He said not to tell a soul.
He meant Philippe, not me.
I don't know. He doesn't know that you know that...
Where are you supposed to meet him?
- He said not to tell.
- Then don't.
But should I go?
Meet him, don't meet him.
Do whatever you want. Only don't ask me.
It's getting out of hand.
I just wish I were a lot older or a lot younger.
Pig, pig, pig.
I ate like a pig.
Sleepy?
In a way.
No.
I have to work.
- I have to go meet Lombard anyway.
- Where are you meeting him?
- His yacht's anchored around the point.
- Why don't we all go?
Because I simply must get at those sketches.
- I thought you would stop work.
- After the wedding.
Today is father and daughter day. You two go.
Bye.
- Can I go with you?
- Darling, no. You've got to study.
Anne doesn't think Lombard's a good influence.
- She suggested I go.
- That's very generous of her but I mustn't take advantage of her generosity.
What a fak e.
What an incredible fak e.
But I love him.
Don't study too hard, Madame Pascal Spinoza.
It's gone too far.
I must tell her.
I must tell her right away that this is all my doing.
There's no question. I must tell her.
But how?
What can I tell her?
She'll never forgive me.
And she'll have a weapon against me forever.
Where's she going?
Maybe she wants to join him at the Lombards' yacht.
I can't let her go.
I must stop her.
No. Maybe I won't stop her.
I'd lik e to see what she'll do.
- No, Raymond, stop that.
You're very nervy.
You think you can pick up right where we left off?
Not at all, you were sunburned then.
- I've got a brilliant tan now, haven't I?
- Lovely.
Lovelier than Anne's?
Much. But then a young girl's skin is always much lovelier.
You didn't seem to think so a few weeks ago.
Stop punishing me because I had to satisfy my curiosity.
You weren't curious, you were greedy.
And why were you ready to marry her?
With a woman like Anne, you have to say a thing like that and you know it.
Wait!
Please stay. It's my fault.
Please, Cecile, let go.
Anne, we need you.
- You don't need anybody. Either of you.
- We do.
- No, wait.
Forgive me.
- No, you forgive me.
- Been trying to write to her.
- Where?
To Paris?
I suppose that's where she's gone.
What can I say?
"Dear Anne: I'm sorry I went to the wood with Elsa."
Meaning, "I'm sorry you caught me"?
"It meant nothing to me. That sort of thing never does."
She'll never understand that.
"Dear Anne: A man says silly things to a silly woman." Particularly if he's a vain, silly man.
It was bound to happen sooner or later.
If not with Elsa, with somebody else.
I'm a very silly man.
- Don't talk that way.
- At least I'm aware of it.
We can get her back.
We'll both write, ask her to forgive both of us.
- Why both of us?
- You, then.
No, me too. I wasn't very nice to her either.
Where's that pen?
If we put our silly heads together, we can think of something to say.
Maybe we won't have to write at all.
Hello?
Yes.
Where?
May I have that, please?
She was a friend of ours.
Later they told us that was the seventh accident at that spot since the beginning of summer.
Seven.
My lucky number.
Anyone else would have left my father a note that would have ruined his sleep for the rest of his life.
But Anne gave both of us a magnificently considerate present.
She allowed us to believe her death was an accident.
My father never mentions the word "suicide" to anybody. Not even to me.
Why don't we have dinner tomorrow?
- There's a new club near the Tremoille.
- Yes, I've been.
- Fun?
- Great fun.
Well, good night.
I never heard from Philippe again.
I suppose he finished law school.
Elsa, she's living in South America.
And my father and me we still share this apartment our evenings, our friends.
This summer we're going south again for his holiday.
Only this time to the Italian Riviera.
"For a change," we say to each other. But we don't say why we want a change, nor do we ask.
We have an unspok en agreement never to mention last summer.
Come in.
You're checking in early.
Denise is a bore.
So soon?
Well, there's no time limit on bores.
By the way, did you notice Yvonne Marie at that cocktail party?
Yes.
She didn't look bad at all.
No, I should say not.
Not bad at all.
Will you be taking her south?
I'll let you know at the end of the week.
If you do perhaps you'd rather I didn't come.
You have to come.
You have to.
Then I'll come.
Besides you need the rest. You're tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Raymond.
So here I am, surrounded by my wall of memory.
I try to stop remembering but I can't.
And so often I wonder:
When he's alone is he remembering too?
I hope not.
Pull up!
Where you headin', mister?
That town called Río Arriba?
- Tha's right. - Tha's where I'm headin'.
Are you Mr Simms?
The sheriff don't want any strangers in town. Not till day after tomorrow.
- Then I'm in time.
- For what?
The hanging'.
Tomorrow, ain't it?
Yes. So just turn around and go back.
You're welcome to Río Arriba the day after.
I've ridden 100 miles to see this hanging'.
Tha's for the sheriff to decide.
Unbuckle your gun belt.
Give me your rifle.
Don't take the hand off the butt.
Ride in slow.
I go right behind you.
- Who is it?
- Shh. I don't know.
Tha's his office.
Picked him up on San Marcos Pass.
Said he came to see the hanging.
I told you not to let anybody through except Simms. Get back and see you do it.
Yes, sir.
- Well, you got a name?
- Douglass.
Who are you lookin' for?
Did I say I was lookin' for somebody?
Río Arriba's a quiet little town.
We don't get many strangers here.
What do you want?
I's like your deputy said.
I come here to see the hanging'.
- Where did you ride in from?
You rode 100 miles over the mountains just to watch a hangin'?
Know the men who are gonna die?
You just like to watch hangings, is that it?
I'll keep your guns.
You stay away from this jail while you're in town.
- What time is the hanging'?
- Six o'clock in the mornin'.
They start serving breakfast at the hotel at 5:30.
You can watch it on a full stomach.
- My name is Loomis. I own the bank.
- How do you do?
They shot my bank full of holes, killed my teller.
But we caught 'em red-handed, all four of 'em.
- No, sir. They didn't get a dime.
- When you hang 'em tomorrow, do it slow.
- Afraid you got me confused, young fella.
- Aren't you Mr Simms? The hangman from Silver City?
No. If you're not the hangman, what are you doing here?
- Just passin' through.
- Maybe he came here to help 'em break out.
Just lookin' to feed my horse and find a hotel room.
Sir, I'm the hotel clerk.
I can find you a room. May I take your horse?
All right.
- You didn't answer my question, mister.
- I didn't hear you ask one.
- Wha's your business here in Río Arriba?
- Quinn! Put it down.
Ain't we got enough trouble without you startin' more?
Folks are a bit edgy today.
Might be a good idea for you to stay in the hotel.
All right, break it up.
Tha's just what we're tryin' to avoid, a crowd. You ought to know that.
Come on, break it up. - You going to church tonight, Tom?
- Emma? - Yes, Father.
Coming.
Are you, Tom?
- Yeah, I'll be there. Willie, take care of this horse.
Saturday, we gave 'em a fair trial.
We never had a hangin' in this town.
We had to send to Silver City for a man to do the job.
We all thought you was him!
Well, i's not my line.
But if he don't show up, I might accommodate you.
Tony.
- Take my horse and I'll meet you at the store.
- Yes, Miss Josefa.
Jim!
Josefa.
- It must be four years.
- I's closer to five.
Well, when I saw you crossing from the courthouse, I just couldn't believe it was you.
I still can't believe it, Jim.
I's me all right.
This is an occasion.
It deserves a celebration.
- Yes, it does.
- Come on. I'll buy you a beer.
- Sí, señorita. Le's sit here.
What brings you to Río Arriba, Jim?
Nice country.
What are you doing here?
I have some business with the sheriff's office.
Have you been back to New Orleans?
No. - We had fun. - Uh-huh.
Since my father died, I don't get to travel much.
- Where have you been?
- I got a little ranch outside Winthrop.
I never heard about it.
Small place.
Sometimes I wish mine were.
I's too much for a woman to handle.
- You never got married?
I just can't seem to find the right man.
Maybe you're too particular.
Tha's what my father said.
When we met in New Orleans... I was husband-hunting.
You were?
I guess I... I guess I did behave a little foolishly.
I don't know, maybe you were smart.
Did you ever marry?
Yes, I did.
Fine girl.
I'm sure.
I have to go.
- How long are you gonna be in town?
- Just until tomorrow.
Well... I's good to see you again, Jim.
Amigo.
Whiskey.
Willie!
Take Mr Simms' horse to the stable.
I'll tell the sheriff you're here.
Mind if I join you?
Sit down.
Can I buy you a drink?
- I have mine.
- I hate to drink alone.
Oh, bartender?
Simms is the name, from Silver City.
I've come to perform a little service for you folks.
Say, what does a man do for a little recreation in this town?
At night, I mean.
I'm a stranger here, myself.
Mr Simms?
Oh, Sheriff. Come in and have a drink.
No, thanks.
Would you care to inspect the gallows and look at the prisoners?
There's plenty of time for that.
Had a long trip. Think I'd like to freshen up.
- Your room's ready, Mr Simms.
- Oh, thank you.
I hope I see you again, sir.
Of course, not professionally.
I'll drop over to the jail this afternoon.
Sheriff?
I wonder if I could see the prisoners.
- You said you didn't know 'em.
- I never met 'em, but I think I know 'em.
Did they do you a bad turn?
I've been following them for six months. Tracking 'em up and down the state.
I's a relief to catch up with them and find out the law's gonna do the job for me.
- You're sure they're the same bunch?
- Two white men, a half-breed and an Indian?
Tha's them. We never had anything like it in Río Arriba before. I'll be glad when i's over.
You're wasting good lumber.
A tree would have done. They were sentenced to be hanged, not lynched.
- Primo?
- Yes, sir.
- They giving you any trouble?
- No. - Feed 'em?
- They ate.
All right, come here.
On your feet! All of you!
I said move!
- Can you spare a smoke, stranger?
What are you gonna do?
Punish us if we talk? I was hopin' you'd bring us a woman, Sheriff.
Like to know their names?
Much obliged.
Who's that, Sheriff?
- Don't you know him?
- I never saw him before in my life.
He came to see you hang.
- This is the last night.
Watch 'em.
- Yes, sir. And don't talk to 'em.
If they want anything, call me.
- Sheriff?
- Hm? You think I might get off long enough to go to church tonight?
I'll see. I'll do what I can.
- Parral, Father Bailey's here to see you.
- I told you to keep him outta here!
- Your mother's with him.
- I don't wanna see her either!
Primo. - What time is it?
- I don't talk to you.
You're the only one we got nothin' against, Primo.
Primo takes good care of us.
We all love him.
- Well, I don't love you.
- Sure you do!
First time I have a little niño, I'm gonna name him Primo, after you.
You joke when you should be praying.
Get down!
What you thinkin', Zach?
Wonderin' who that stranger is.
- The way he looked, he didn't come to help.
- I can't place him.
He seemed to know you.
He looked at you the hardest.
- Luján. - Mm?
You ever see that man before?
No, but he's got the face of a hunter.
Zach, we don't have much time.
- Don't you think we know that?
- We can'tjust wait here. Go ahead, bang your head on the bars and yell.
They'll hang you right now.
Why, you say the darndest things sometimes.
Good evening, Mr Steinmetz.
Hello, Tom. Emma, you know where I put my stomach powders? - Oh, yes, Father.
- Would you get me one?
Just in case.
Tom, Emma is a fine girl.
Yes, sir. I think so too.
The worlïs big and there are many wonderful places in it, and I'd like Emma to see them.
- Well, sir, I want...
- Let me finish, Tom.
I was a pedlar when I came here.
I's taken a quarter of a century to make what I got today.
And now I am too old to enjoy it.
I want Emma to enjoy it.
But not in this out-of-the-way small town.
I want her to marry some man who lives in Philadelphia or Boston.
Has his business there.
Mixes with educated people.
- Am I wrong to want that for her, Tom?
Right now, Emma thinks she loves you.
I guess she does.
But she's never had a chance to meet anyone else.
I want to give her that chance.
- Now, what has he been telling you?
- About Philadelphia and Boston.
Gosh. Wouldn't you love to go there?
- Good evening, Sheriff.
- Good evening, Mr Steinmetz.
Must be big doings in church tonight.
Looks like everyone in town is going.
Tha's right.
I's our annual novena to St Anthony.
- Would you like to look at the prisoners?
- I'd like to finish my cigar first.
All right, there's no hurry.
Finish your cigar.
I think I'll stretch my legs.
I's open.
Jim? Come in.
I'm on my way to church.
I thought that you might like to go.
I don't go to church any more.
Jim, I... I don't understand.
Very simple
- I just don't go.
I'm sorry.
Very sorry.
If you'll allow me, I'll walk you there.
Of course.
Stay down.
- Think the sheriff would let us go to church?
I's all right if I look at it from the window, isn't it?
All right.
Everyone's going to church.
You think they'd pray for us, Primo?
Primo. Will you pray for us?
You want me to?
You're a good man, Primo.
Goïll listen to you.
- What should I pray for?
- That we go to heaven.
I can't do that.
But I will pray that God will forgive you.
I'll settle for that.
Was it Tucker?
How soon, do you think, before he'll make his try?
When everyone's in church.
No talking!
I'm prayin', Primo.
Do you have any children, Jim?
- Little girl.
- How old is she?
Three.
Pretty?
She's pretty.
Like her mother was.
"Was"?
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
- Good evening, Sheriff.
- Evening, Josefa.
You must have been very much in love.
Still am.
Beautiful evening, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Thanks, Josefa.
Guess I needed to talk to a woman.
There's a woman inside I think you might do well to talk to.
Well, should we take a look at our bad boys now?
Fine.
- Everything all right?
- Yes, sir. You go on to church now.
Mr Simms is with me.
- Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you, Mr Simms. - And Primo...
Come back as soon as the service is over.
Mr Simms may wanna get to bed early.
Oh, tha's all right, Sheriff.
- Take your time. Don't worry about me.
- Thank you, sir.
All right. On your feet, all of you.
Over here.
Can't we have a little more light in here, Sheriff?
- Sure.
- I'd like to get a good idea of size and weight.
Hold him up while I get the key.
- There's a key dropped on the floor.
- All right, get it.
- I can't reach it.
- Reach with the dipper.
Blanket.
Come on!
- We take her along.
- She'll slow us down.
They won't rush us as long as we've got her.
Get the horses.
I think we're all aware of the shadow that has fallen over Río Arriba.
The gallows cast a shadow even at night.
Tomorrow four men are to die.
That they die is the just fulfilment of Caesar's law.
But I remind you that these four men are also creatures of God, eligible for His mercy.
Pray for them as He would.
If you recall, there was also scaffolding at Golgotha.
And Christ, bleeding and dying, took time in his agony to turn and pardon a common thief.
Remember that tomorrow.
For all of you, i'll be daybreak.
But for these four men... i'll be the midnight of their lives.
Your prayers will help them.
Help!
Wha's the matter? Que pasa?
- Here's her purse.
- How's the sheriff?
- He's badly hurt.
Everybody, come on, le's go!
Get your horses and guns!
- Get your gun and horse. Le's go.
- Where?
- After 'em!
- They stole five horses!
We can't find Emma.
They've taken her.
Josefa! They've taken Emma.
Wha'll I do? Please help me.
Please!
Mr Steinmetz, we'll all help.
I'll get my horse and go with you. Come on, Jim.
You can't overtake 'em tonight before they get to San Marcos Pass.
- One of 'em can hold that against a hundred.
- Aren't you coming with us?
I's gonna be a long hard chase. I could use some sleep.
I'll wait till morning.
Do you mean to tell me, after wha's happened, you can just go and sleep?
Yes. And then what?
I'm gonna find them, if i's the last thing I do.
Good night.
- What do you think?
- With the woman, they can overtake us.
Taylor, stay here and hold them off till sundown.
We'll head for Elder Gorge.
We'll wait for you there.
- Please let me go!
- Later.
- Please. My father will give you anything.
- I've already got all he can give me.
Everybody, le's go! Come on!
Quinn, how about those boys back there?
Come on!
Quinn!
Steinmetz!
Le's go.
Get your horse, go into town and get a wagon here.
Take this man down with the others.
Primo, Murphy looks bad.
There's nothing I can do.
Do what you can.
I've sent for a wagon.
All we can do is wait. Then we'll follow them over the pass.
Once they get to the desert, we can circle 'em.
- We can lose 'em.
- They got Emma!
- I'm not going to take that chance.
- Hold it!
Primo's right.
You can't rush 'em.
But don't worry about losin' her.
What do you know? Who are you?
You're a stranger. You say, "You can't rush them. "
Tha's all right for you, but my daughter's in danger.
Maybe you want us to lose them. I've been followin' them for six months.
I'm not gonna lose 'em now.
If I was you... I'd pick out 12 of these men and send the rest of 'em home.
Especially the old fella and the lady over there.
- I can't send Mr Steinmetz home.
- He'll not do any good and get in the way.
He won't leave.
I'm sorry.
Primo just told me you don't want me along.
Well, tha's right.
Emma's gonna need me when we catch up with them.
With you along, we might not catch up with them.
You might get hurt.
I wouldn't want to see that.
Are you worried about me?
These are mean men we're after.
They're real mean.
- For the gorge you must turn off here.
- You still like that idea?
- Yes. We told Taylor we'd wait there.
- We'd move faster on the desert.
Tha's where they'll be lookin' for us.
If we keep movin', we can reach the border in two days.
In the desert we can only ride at night. Two days and we'll burn up.
- She won't last a day.
- Why do we need her?
I need her.
We'll head for the gorge and hole up there till they stop searching'. Lead, Luján.
- What do you think, Mr Douglass?
- Sun's goin' down. Tha's what he waited for.
We can't track 'em by night.
- Le's move ahead as long as we can see.
- Everybody, get mounted!
Somebody build a fire.
Start up some coffee.
Can't we go on? Just you and me?
- Be like lookin' for a needle in a haystack.
- Yeah, but I'm worried about Emma.
Suppose we were lucky enough to stumble across 'em. You don't think they'd give up without a fight?
- She'd be the first they'd kill.
- Here is one of them! Here he is!
Come on, all of you!
Come here, all of you!
I found one of them!
There he is.
See? Must be one of them.
This is not one of them.
That must be the real Mr Simms.
- Got a timepiece? - No, sir.
Here.
You go back to the rim of the gorge.
- Then fire a shot every five minutes.
- But what good will that do?
Sound carries a long way in these canyons.
They'll hear it.
Make 'em wonder. Keep 'em up all night.
Take their minds off Emma.
One of us will relieve him every hour.
Keep it up all night.
You take turns standing watch.
I'll look after the horses.
I'll take the last tour.
You'll take the first.
I'll take the first watch.
Can't sleep anyway.
When we get out of this, you wanna stick with me or split up?
- Well, I haven't given it much thought.
- I have. You're a good man, Taylor.
I should hate to lose you.
Well, I sort of like havin' a man behind me I can count on.
That Parral's a louse.
The Injun makes me nervous.
Never know wha's goin' on inside his head.
- I never crossed a man that rode with me.
- Well, neither did I.
I need you with me.
That goes double.
I got one weakness I feel you should know about.
Wha's that?
Women.
Every man's entitled to one weakness.
You think Luján needs some help with the horses?
Well now, he just might.
Is that silk?
Where'd that come from?
- Where'd that shot come from?
- I's an old trick. They wanna keep us awake.
Get back on watch.
Go to sleep.
You never hear the shot that kills you.
Well, they were here all right. Not too long ago.
Looks like those shots of ours changed their path.
Tracks show they went down the gorge.
Yeah. Could be the Indian's thinking, to throw us off.
Stop that, you idiot!
- I want Emma to know we're following.
- Now they all know!
You said we'd lose them in the gorge.
They're smarter than you thought, red man.
There's only one man that could have followed us down here.
The one with the eyes of the hunter.
The strange one.
- That the sheriff brought to jail to look at us.
- He's right.
I saw him with the posse up in San Marcos Pass.
Well, who is he?
Wha's he doggin' us for?
- Maybe she knows.
- I never saw him before he came.
- Why did he come?
- To watch you hang.
- I's the truth!
- Let her go!
- He must know one of you.
- Maybe i's you he's after.
How could he be?
I never saw him before.
No. He don't look like no banker. Or the owner of any place we ever robbed.
Le's kill him. Then the others can't follow us.
- I's a good idea.
You do it. - Can't Luján do it?
No. We need Luján to take us to the border.
You catch up with us tonight.
- Why me?
- It was your idea!
What is it, Mr Douglass?
You see movement up there in that tall grass?
No, sir.
I think there's a man there, waitin' for us to come in range.
Why don't we make him fire first?
- Then one of us would be dead.
- We gonna wait for sundown again? Primo.
You take the lead.
You and the others circle the hill.
Stay just outside rifle range of that tall grass.
I'll go up the other side.
- Why are you doing this for us, Mr Douglass?
- I'm not doin' it for you.
Come on.
Come on. Keep moving.
- I'm waitin' for you.
- I'm here.
Drop it.
You remember that woman?
Now look at it.
- No. - You're lying!
I never saw her before. I swear I didn't.
You stopped at my ranch six months ago.
I never saw your ranch.
I don't even know where it is.
- There were four of you.
- We never did.
Please. You gotta believe me.
She begged.
And cried.
And pleaded too, didn't she?
"Please, leave me alone.
I have a baby. "
"I have a husband.
Please, leave me alone. "
"Take anything you want, but please leave me alone. "
Didn't she?
But it didn't help much.
I never saw that face before.
I was never on your ranch. I never did anything to you.
Which one of you? Which one of you did it?
I didn't do it.
I've done some bad things.
Robbed. Stole. - I've run cattle.
But I never killed no woman. - Talk!
There were four of you. Which one?
Which one?
Don't do it. Please let me live.
Please let me live. Please.
I've got a wife and baby, too. Don't do it.
Please don't do it. I'll do anything.
Then it was all four of you!
Holy Mother, help...
- Morning, Father.
- Morning, Josefa.
- How's the sheriff?
- Much better.
Good.
Poor Mrs Parral.
I feel so sorry for her.
I's hard to believe. One child can bring so much happiness, so much grief.
Any news of Primo and the men?
No. - Douglass has gone with them, hasn't he?
- Yes. - He came to church with you. - Yes.
Do you know him?
Years ago.
I hadn't seen him in five years.
But he's changed.
What happened to him, Father?
Quite a lot.
He was out tending his cattle. Came home one evening to find that his house had been ransacked and his wife had been raped and murdered.
- How awful.
- I think tha's what brought him to Río Arriba.
Jim Douglass is not the kind of man to just watch a hanging.
Must be some connection between those men and what happened at the ranch.
I think that Jim must believe that those men committed the crime.
- Did they?
- Nobody knows. I doubt if Jim knows.
But his child. What happened to the child?
A ranch hand and his wife are taking care of her.
That child could have been mine.
I was in love with Jim Douglass and he asked me to marry him.
I didn't have the sense to say yes.
You'd have married a good man.
How do I get to his ranch?
After San Marcos Pass, you take the Winthrop road to Canyon Diablo.
There'll be a small stone cabin.
- You think Parral got our man?
- I hope they got each other.
Look.
Yeah. There's Parral now.
He got our man.
I feel better.
Tha's not Parral.
I's the hunter.
- How could they have caught us so soon?
- They haven't.
I's only one man.
Well, we can handle one man easy enough.
He's marking a trail for the posse.
- Le's wait for him.
- And let the posse gain on us?
- Go on.
I'll catch up with you. - Why you?
I'm a better shot.
And I don't like a man doggin' my trail.
What do you think, Luján?
There's sure to be someone there.
- Then we'll get somethin' to eat.
- We need fresh horses more than food.
Then we'll get both.
Come back here!
Now, where did you think you were goin'?
Aw, don't cry.
I'm not gonna make you walk.
I'm gonna let you ride.
Right up here, next to me.
We haven't seen Douglass since he killed Parral.
He must have gone back.
Douglass didn't go back.
Look.
Can you spare a little food?
We haven't eaten all day.
Fooïs pretty scarce around these parts.
We're willin' to pay for hospitality.
- Where you headin'?
- Río Arriba.
Well, you're lost.
You're headed in the wrong direction.
Río Arriba's across the Diablo in the north.
You can spare a little grub for the lady, can't you?
- I guess so.
- We'd be satisfied with a cup of coffee.
You know what happened to your horse?
- Just one word and you'll get the same.
- I won't talk.
Eggs!
- Where can we get a couple of horses?
- Well, the... Douglass ranch is about four miles west of here.
But I don't know if they've got any horses or not.
Don't get any foolish ideas.
Wha's that?
- I's gold.
- Them's my teeth.
- Where's your gold?
- I haven't any.
- What are you mining for?
- Silver.
So far I haven't found any.
Well... - I gotta get back to work. - Go ahead.
Don't let us stop you.
What did he take?
Go and see what it was.
- Le's go.
The posse's coming!
- Go ahead. I'll be along.
I said now!
Come.
There's the miner's cabin.
Douglass' ranch should be about four more miles west.
Who's that?
You know, that looks like Jim Douglass.
Jim! - I'm glad I caught up with you.
- Why?
Jim, why don't you stop this mad chase after these men and let them go?
You can't undo wha's been done.
And you have a child to think of.
How can you be so sure these are the men?
Come here.
Look at this.
Tha's John Butler, my neighbour.
Poor devil never harmed anybody in his life.
Now they've killed him.
Le's get him in the house.
Jim! Jim, come here!
Come quickly! Emma!
Come on!
Hurry! Hurry!
Mr Steinmetz, hurry! We've found Emma.
She's here, in the house.
- How is she?
- I don't know.
Please don't worry, Emma.
Everything's fine now.
Really it is.
Look, Tom's here and your father's here.
I know how you feel.
Go after them, Jim, and catch them.
Get them before... Kill them!
Kill them!
You take your men and head for the border.
I'm going by my place to pick up a fresh horse.
- I'll meet you at the river. - Yes, sir.
Everybody! Get movin'!
All right, le's get goin'.
Juanita!
No te apures. We're not far behind, but they took the only horses that were here.
Helen, this is Josefa.
She's a good friend of mine.
A very good friend.
- I want you to stay with her until I get back. - Yes.
I don't know when tha'll be.
I'll take care of her.
Just as if she were my own.
I guess I haven't been much of a father.
Bye.
God bless you, Jim.
It looks like it all right.
Mr Douglass, here are the tracks.
This is where they crossed the river.
This is the international border.
We can't go further.
I can.
Señora, did you see two men on horseback cross the river here today?
Who are you?
What do you want with me?
- Look at it.
- I see it.
What of it?
I's a watch.
Look at the picture.
What about her? Who is she?
- You remember her.
- I never saw that woman before in my life.
Now get outta here.
I'm tired of you doggin' my trail.
She was my wife.
Raped and killed by you.
I tell you I never saw that woman before in my life.
Where's the Indian who rode up here on that horse?
Eat.
Why don't you kill me?
I came here to kill you.
I have no reason to kill you.
Why do you hunt me?
Just look at that picture.
- Your wife and baby? - Yeah.
She's very pretty.
My wife and baby, they are pretty.
Why do you hunt me?
- You ever see that woman before? - No.
There were four men.
Two white men, a half-breed and an Indian.
They robbed my ranch house and killed my wife.
I have never seen your ranch.
The horse you rode up here you stole from my ranch!
I did not know that was your ranch and I didn't see any woman.
If you've never been to my ranch, where'd you get this money?
That I took from a miner I met in Canyon Diablo.
We were at his house.
We ate his eggs and meat.
Then he ran down the hill to hide that money and Zachary killed him.
I took that money from his hand when he was dead.
Butler was the one who told me - six months ago, the day my wife was murdered - that the four of you, you came straight from my ranch past his place.
It is true.
We did come past his place.
But we did not come from the direction of your ranch.
We came straight from the border.
How...
Where did Butler get that money?
It was stolen from my house the day...
If my wife...
Butler.
What I have told you is the truth.
Oh, God.
Dear God.
Tha's him.
He's back.
Sheriff, he's back.
Glad you're back, Jim.
You've been away a long time.
Father, I need help.
- We all do.
- I killed three men.
The people of Río Arriba are thankful that you broughtjustice where they failed.
You don't understand. I...
I didn't... kill them for the sake ofjustice.
You were a member of an armed posse legally sent out to get them, dead or alive.
No, Father. I didn't kill them for anything that they did here in Río Arriba.
I killed them for revenge.
Revenge for something that they didn't even do.
I set myself up as the judge, the... jury and the... executioner.
They swore that they were innocent.
One of them even... He begged on his knees... for his life.
I wouldn't listen.
I killed them for something that they didn't do.
Jim, let me point this out to you.
By telling me what you have and feeling as you do, you're already a step ahead of a lot of other men that have been in your shoes.
That doesn't mean I'm condoning what you've done, but at least you haven't excused your own actions by saying, as many men would, that these men were evil and should die, and that you carried out a legal execution.
I know that, Father, but... it doesn't help.
I was wrong.
Come on.
Some people think prayers help.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no need for me to tell you, the emergency arose... and the man appeared.
Douglass, i's not often a man gets to do so much for his neighbours, and do it like you did.
We want you to know, we'll be forever grateful and you'll be in our hearts always.
Thank you.
And in your prayers.
Please.
Hey, Lew! Do you want to check this one?
He don't look like much.
Hey mister!
- Morning.
Ride over here and get off your horse.
He told you to get down.
What for?
- I'll ask the questions.
Go ahead.
I can hear you fine, right from where I'm sitting.
Mister, I don't want to have to shoot you off that horse.
And I sure wouldn't want you to, Sheriff.
Check his saddle bags first.
Wasting your time!
Only thing I've got on me is worth a hoot is this here gun belt.
Sure, give me the price of a good meal and a night's lodging and you can have this whole caboodle.
What do you say?
Somebody chasing you, Roy?
You did that on purpose, Lafe.
Why don't you grow up, Roy?
What's the matter with him?
Same old thing, getting himself in trouble across the line.
Where you heading, mister?
- West Texas.
West Texas! Ha! I should have known it!
You know one West Texan can always spot another West Texan by the way he sets his horse, or walks down the street.
Or totes his gun.
I'm from West Texas.
Name's Pecos.
Glad to know you.
- This one isn't carrying nothing, Lew.
We get enough drifters coming across the border
I wouldn't linger in Agry Town if I was you.
I don't linger no place until I get back where I belong.
You're the man to see, I want to get a room.
Cost you $10. In advance.
Well, I'm not staying a week, I just want a room for the night.
Well, it will still cost you $10.
I've got some tens in here somewhere. I...
I could change one of them fifties for you, sir.
You sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?
- Oh, not at all, sir.
There you are, mister er...?
- The name's Buchanan.
Your room is the first one at the head of the stairs.
I'll use it later.
Where can I get something to eat?
They'll fix you up with a good steak across at the saloon.
Oh, Mr Buchanan, a border town ain't no place to go walking around
I'd advise you to leave it with me in the safe.
It's safe right where it is.
Be sure to tell Nacho that Amos Agry sent you.
You related to him?
He's my brother.
The Sheriff is my brother too, his name's Lew Agry.
Looks like you got mighty high connections?
Morning, dad.
Don't you ever do that again!
I'll do it every time you go chasing across the border.
I'll settle for a lot but not another woman.
- What are you talking about?
Where d'you get those scratches?
- I rode through some brush.
Looks like you tried to ride through some Mexican wildcat.
Roy!
When you leave, you get me that bottle of whiskey.
I can't do it, your father gave me strict orders.
Get me that bottle or I'll come back there and take it!
I can't do it, Roy.
- How about me?
I was told I could get some whiskey and a good steak here.
You watch out who you're pushing.
Looked like you were arguing and wasn't getting you anywhere
I don't want no steak that's out and out raw,
I want the middle on the red side.
This ain't a very friendly town.
If I was you I would get out of here quick.
That was Roy Agry you just hit, mister.
Ain't there anybody in this town that ain't an Agry?
Please go, senor.
While I'm waiting for that steak I'll buy a bottle. Of that one.
What I don't drink I'll take with me.
How much?
- $10.
The steak?
Good thing I'm only staying over the night.
Sure is a $10 town.
Hey, kid! How about a shot of this?
Maybe you need it.
Hold it, son, I built up a small hanker myself.
Nacho, you're fixing up trouble for yourself.
Amos, I didn't give him the bottle, he gave it to him.
He certainly looked like he could use a drink.
He ain't no son of mine.
I'd appreciate it if you'd bring that bottle back here.
Do you know what I'm gonna do?
If you keep pulling on that bottle I do.
When I finish this, I'm gonna kill you.
Now that's just Jim Dandy, son.
But in the meantime, would you mind bringing me my steak?
Oh-ooh.
What do you want?
You've got to get over the saloon right away.
- What for?
Roy's been drinking and he says he's gonna kill a fella.
Roy ain't got guts enough to kill nobody.
Maybe not sober, but when he's been drinking there ain't nothing
What's it to you what Roy does?
- Well, he's our nephew, ain't he?
Besides, that fella's carrying a lot of money, I've seen it.
Lew, if you ain't gonna stop him I'm gonna tell Simon.
Stop worrying, Roy ain't gonna kill nobody.
- Lew, I tell you...
Shut up and get out of here.
'A lot of money.'
Who did we miss, Waldo?
Let's finish the hand and go find out.
Put one of these on the wall right above the bar, Nacho.
You might put another one over here.
It's not my fault, Mr Carbo.
I did not serve Roy the whiskey.
Didn't say you did.
Roy is going to kill him.
He is?
Well...
Mighty tasty steak.
- Thank you, senor.
Anybody wants me I'll be over at the hotel getting some shut-eye.
The name's Buchanan.
Quite a town!
Roy Agry!
Do not do this, boy.
Take it easy son, he's drunk.
Stay where you are.
No, Palito, no.
Please!
Please go back home.
I will after I kill him.
If you kill him you will never see your home again.
Stay out of there.
Take him over to the jail house and wait for him to come to.
When I hang a man I like him to know what's going on.
So they got Roy.
I told you what was gonna happen.
You told me!
You couldn't have been more wrong.
You said he was going to kill somebody.
Nacho, tell the undertaker to get his wagon over here.
I guess I better tell Simon.
Don't be gone too long or you'll miss the hanging.
You ain't never seen a double hanging!
You're gonna hang Mr Buchanan?
- That's right.
The way I figure, he and the Mex were in this together.
How much do you figure's in that purse, Lew?
- Well, it's hard to say.
If it wasn't for me you wouldn't have known he was csarrying that money.
Don't worry, I'll cut you in for your share.
- How much?
This doesn't seem like a likely time to be haggling over money, especially when it doesn't belong to you, Lew.
I guess I better go break the sad news to Simon.
I'll take care of that, Amos.
Try to understand, as soon as they hear us, they'll swing us from the nearest tree.
Comprende?
I understand English, senor.
I am grateful for what you did, but I'm sorry I brought you trouble.
We both got trouble, big trouble.
For me it does not matter.
Roy Agry is dead.
Why did you kill him?
Cannot tell you, senor.
The name's Buchanan, what's yours?
Sorry, but I would rather not say.
That's all right.
We ain't got much time to get acquainted anyway.
Come on!
- All right, Lew, what are we waiting for?
We're still waiting for 'em to wake up.
Here, go check on 'em.
Get up.
Morning, Nina.
Where's the Judge?
Anyone ever tell you you're a mighty handsome woman?
- Many thanks, senor.
When are you gonna leave the Judge and work for me?
The Judge treats me very well.
- I can treat you better.
Why should I leave a man of Judge Agry's position to work for you?
That's for you to answer, beautiful.
And remember if you wait too long I may not want you.
Morning, Simon.
- Morning.
Nina! Bring another glass.
I already have it, senor.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, Simon.
- Oh? Yeah?
Roy has been... shot.
Roy, dead.
It was inevitable.
Who did it?
A young Mexican.
Looks like a man named Buchanan helped him.
Did they get away?
No.
Simon, you'd better get down to the jail before they string him up.
Lew has everybody primed for a lynching.
You're smart, you'll stop it.
Why should I do that?
Because everybody in these parts knows that Simon Agry stands for law and order.
A lynching could cost you a lot of votes, Simon.
Aside from the fact the young man's name just happens to be
Juan de la Vega.
Don Pedro's son?
Why?
Ask me, I'd say the old gentleman might be willing to part with a lot of pesos to get his son back safe.
You're right.
Can't have no lynching with me coming up for election.
Sheriff, you are making a big mistake!
You cannot hang Senor Buchanan, he had nothing to do with it.
I killed Roy Agry.
Yeah, and he helped you.
- That's right, Lew.
No, you're wrong.
He had nothing to do with it.
Save your breath, kid.
Nobody's listening to you.
I am truly sorry, senor. So am I.
All right, string 'em up.
Wait!
Take those men back to jail!
These men are heading for the cemetery.
Do as I say, take those ropes off their necks.
Please listen to me.
My only son has been killed.
A son I held very dear to my heart.
Who among you has a better reason for wanting to see those murderers hang?
None of you.
I personally would like to put the noose about their neck, but the law forbids it.
You all know that I'm a law-abiding man.
It's my solemn duty to see that they get a fair trial.
That's just what they're gonna get tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.
Now the sheriff here is gonna take these men back to jail.
And I want all of you to go home.
Please, gentlemen!
We must see that justice takes its proper course.
And I shall personally be for ever grateful to you.
All right, take the ropes off.
Senor Buchanan, why did you help me?
Because you needed it.
I wish my father could meet you, so he could thank you for what you did.
Tell me, who is your father?
Well, who is he?
Don Pedro de la Vega.
I'm Juan de la Vega.
The whole of Mexico thinks a lot of your dad.
You've heard of him?
Lots, all good.
He's a fine man.
And he has a fine son.
I saw those scratches on Roy's face.
Was she your wife?
I am not married.
Your sister then?
Look, Jonny, you've gotta tell 'em.
Nobody would hang you for killing a man who did a thing like that.
No-one must ever know, Buchanan.
All right, quiet everybody.
This here trial is about to start.
Now Jim here is going to pass among you with a tray and the Judge wants me to have you put all your glasses in that tray, empty.
Judge don't want no more liquored up opinion like he had in that last trial.
Now sit down some place and take off your hats.
Come on, stand up for the Judge.
Come on, Charlie!
Well, sit down.
All right, this here court is now in session, Judge Simon Agry presiding.
Waldo, bring in the prisoners.
Bring in the prisoners!
Put that gavel down.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down!
I see the defendants have no legal representation.
We don't need no lawyer, Judge.
What is your full name?
- Tom Buchanan.
What is your full name?
I killed Roy Agry, that is all you have to know.
Your name is Juan de la Vega.
Stand up, Buchanan.
He had nothing to do with it.
Sit him down.
Where do you hail from, Buchanan? West Texas.
Where are you headed?
- Back home.
What's your occupation?
Well?
Well, I'm trying to think.
It seems to be quite a chore.
I ain't much of a thinker, Judge.
I grew up chasing cows.
Whose cows?
My dad's.
Until the drought and the bank wiped us out.
What then.
- I ramrodded some, a little border spread, and then I got some ideas about owning for my own, so I crossed the line and tried to stake myself some animals.
By rustling?
No, sir.
Fighting.
Oh, so you're a fighter?
- Yes, sir.
What kind of fighting?
Almost any kind, provided there's money in it.
I joined General Campos in Mexico.
Then murder is nothing new to you, Buchanan.
Ain't murder when you're killing a revolution. Why aren't you still there?
Revolution petered out.
Besides I...
I got myself a stake.
I see.
According to this charge, you're an accessory to the murder of Roy Agry.
How do you plead?
Your son getting shot is no business of mine.
You got any questions, Lew?
Yeah.
Mister, wouldn't you say you made your living as a gunman?
I've turned a dollar with a gun.
And you put in a lot of jail time?
- I've been in jail.
So the fact is you were just another hard case on the dodge?
You could say that.
Tell the Judge here about the fight you picked with Roy just before he was shot.
Nothing to tell. Nothing to tell!
You knocked him down and when he got up you got him drunk.
He was a man full-grown, I offered him a drink, but he took the bottle.
He was still working on it when I left.
Isn't it a fact of the case that you were the advance agent in this killing?
Weren't you sent into town to either goad Roy into a gunfight or get himself drunk he couldn't defend himself?
But the plan misfired, didn't it?
You two did the killing all right, but the Mex here ran smack into the law and you came and tried to break him free.
I saw this boy here getting a licking from this big ape, so I dealt myself in.
I figured it was one thing I could do in this town and it wouldn't cost me 10 bucks.
Oh, you don't like this town.
- I don't like some of its people.
Me included?
- You especially.
Oh, you'd like to kill me maybe?
I'd like to give you what you and your boys gave me.
Take the law into your own hands, is that it?
Well, that's the case, Judge.
He's a gunman that came into town yesterday to set it up for this boy here to kill Roy.
I never saw this boy in my life before yesterday.
I didn't have nothing to do with the killing.
Anybody got any more to say?
You've all heard the evidence, now you've got to decide whether Buchanan was or was not an accessory to the murder of Roy Agry.
You can go out to the back room and talk it over.
You folks sit down until they get out of here.
Have you reached your verdict?
Not guilty, Your Honour.
Since you've been found innocent, your presence in this courtroom
Ivy, escort Mr Buchanan back to the hotel.
I'm glad for you, Buchanan.
Juan de la Vega, stand up.
You are charged with the murder of Roy Agry, my son.
How do you plead?
- I killed your son and I'm glad.
There ain't no point in prolonging this trial, Simon, he admits he killed him, so there ain't nothin' we gotta prove.
You heard the defendant confess that he killed Roy Agry.
As Judge, I have no alternative except to direct you to bring in
I don't think we have to go anyplace to cast our vote, Judge.
Juan de la Vega, you've been found guilty by a jury of 12 freeholders
At an hour before sunset this very day, you will be hung by the neck
Court is adjourned.
I don't care what you say, this ain't no fair share and you know it.
It was only 300, Amos. - You're lying.
You shouldn't call your brother a liar, Amos, it's all the money the
Well, maybe you can fool them but you can't fool me, if I don't get at least ten more of these things, Simon is gonna get an earful.
Amos, you start playing Simon and me against each other, you're gonna get
Here comes Buchanan.
Sheriff, I'll make a deal with you.
You let the boy go and you
Hear that, Waldo?
He's trying to bribe me.
He's a real bad one.
No respect at all for the law.
Want me to lock him up?
No.
I'll forget what you just said, Buchanan.
Now get back on that horse of yours and start riding out of town.
I'd like to see the boy first.
Hello, Jonny.
- I'm very glad to see you again, Buchanan.
I thought this might help.
Thank you.
It was an honour knowing you, Buchanan.
It was an honour knowing you.
Would you do something for me?
- If I can.
Would you ask them to let my horse go, just let him loose at the bridge,
We'll take care of the horse for you.
Well... so long Jonny.
Goodbye, Buchanan.
Where's my gun?
A law-abiding citizen like you don't need no gun.
Give me my belt.
- You're getting it.
Now you saw the kid, git.
Lafe and Pecos will ride out with you.
- I don't need an escort.
You're getting one anyway.
I'm making sure you don't
Sheriff, I had $2,000.
- We were voted out of a double hanging, Buchanan.
Unless you get on that horse and start riding, we'll make up
I'll be back.
- Lafe, you and Pecos try real hard
Don't you worry about it, Lew.
Waldo, you better go back to the hotel and sit with Amos
He might have heard something that upset him.
Amos.
I've been looking for you, hop in.
He can't.
He's got some things to do in the hotel.
Nothing that can't wait until tomorrow.
I think he ought to stop by and talk to Simon, a man likes to have his
You might mention that to Lew.
Get up.
Funeral is set for noon tomorrow. Fine.
What's he doing here?
A couple of loose guns just rode out of town with Buchanan,
Well, Amos, why?
Lew, how come you sent Buchanan out of town under two guns?
You afraid of Buchanan, Lew?
There ain't a man in this world I'm afraid of.
Is that a fact?
- Yeah, that's a fact.
Look, Lew, I don't mind you stealing a few dollars from the trash but don't get ambitious and start trying to buck me.
Lew wouldn't try to buck you, Simon.
Star isn't permanent on your chest.
I put it there and I can take it off.
- You want it back now Simon? No.
We haven't had any real differences yet.
I want both of you to be at the funeral tomorrow.
As Roy's uncles, a few tears certainly wouldn't be out of place.
How are we going to work up any tears over Roy?
Just be sure you rise to the occasion.
I didn't tell him nothing, Carbo seen Buchanan riding out of town,
Lew, there was $2,000 in that purse, Mr Buchanan said so.
Sure he did.
He was standing right there on the porch,
Well, not many fathers feel about their sons the way you did.
This trial could do you a lot of good, Simon, might even make you Governor of California some day.
Senor Agry?
Yes.
Senor Agry?
- Yes, who are you?
Esteban Gomez.
- Won't you come in, please?
This is Mr Carbo, Senor Gomez.
What can I do for you?
- I've come to purchase the
That is impossible, he has been convicted of murder,
I'm sorry to hear that, senor, I will return to Don Pedro and tell him his generous offer has been rejected.
- Well, just a moment, senor, since you've come such a long way I see no harm in discussing it.
Gracias.
Well?
- Don Pedro will deliver to you 30 of his
How could I explain how I came by these fine horses?
I couldn't.
- It's a very generous are blooded stock, they are some of the finest horses in the world.
I'm sure they are.
But the fact remains that Juan de la Vega will be hung this very
$50,000 in American money.
Senor...
- I have nothing more to say.
Judge, I think Senor Gomez should be allowed to take the boy's body back with him so he can be buried in his own country.
It's a very kind suggestion.
You will be permitted to do this.
I do not think Don Pedro can raise that much money, senor.
I'll give him 48 hours to see if he can.
- 48... 48 hours.
You're a very difficult man, senor.
Lew, the hanging is temporarily postponed.
Why?
Because Simon wants it that way, that's why.
When it's on again I'll let you know.
I wonder what Simon's got up his sleeve.
I don't know but whatever it is, that kid's going
Might be making a big mistake, Lew.
Why?
- Well, Simon never was one
If I was you, I'd find out what it is.
Town crier always knows something.
How much further are you boys going to ride along with me?
A ways.
That where you going to kill me?
What do you get paid for a job like this?
Fifty?
Not over a hundred.
Not much more than that.
For a West Texan, you do killin' awful cheap, Pecos.
Buchanan, what was you planning to do with that $2,000?
You know that country up around Endicott?
I sure do.
Well, I had my eye on a spread up there but I never could get me a big
I'd love to have my spread back there,
Then how come you're in California?
Settle footed.
This country is so dang big a man just gets used to moving around, so one day I got tired of watching the sun go west but I ain't itching' no more.
Before long I'll follow the sun right on back to where I come from.
Sounds like you put a lot of store in being a Texan.
A man's got to be loyal to something.
That's the same way I feel.
You come on back here.
Buchanan, I want you to know I don't cotton none to this job.
A man oughtn't do a job he don't cotton to, Pecos.
Forget it.
Right there, Buchanan.
A step down.
Take its saddle off.
Put it down.
Don't turn around.
Who's going to do the shooting?
Both of us.
Lafe why don't we just?
- Shut up, Pecos.
I ain't got no more stomach for this than you have,
Thanks, Pecos.
L - A-F-E, Lafe.
I sure hope old Lafe ain't put out with us for stashing him
With animals all around it seems the only decent thing, don't you think?
Anyways, that hole you dug is done chock full of water, wouldn't hold nothing but a fish.
Lafe,
you and me worked for Lew Agry for nigh on a year and though I don't guess we was ever real buddies, I'm sorry it was me
You had your good side, Lafe, but you had your bad side too, like cheating' at stud and emptying my
But I ain't holding these things aging' you and if you're holding a grudge agin' me, Lafe, just remember that between you and Buchanan here, I just had to choose Buchanan
Like I always say, let bygones be bygones and I hope you're
Well, so long, Lafe, you died real good.
I sure got myself in one of them predicaments, I don't
Pecos, how do you like to be half owner in that spread of mine?
You mean that?
- Sure do.
Yeah, but you ain't got that $2,000 no more.
- I'll get it back. Huh!
Waldo and Lew will shoot you on sight.
Me too.
- I'll take you in as partner whether you'll
Oh, would you?
Buchanan, that's real nice of you, I know just
Why would I be making a big mistake, Amos?
You mean about going ahead with the hanging'?
What's Simon up to?
Why don't you ask him?
- I'm asking you, Amos.
You don't pay too good for information, Lew.
Oh, how much do you want?
I ain't greedy, Lew, all I want is 10,000, you can have all the rest.
All the rest?
And how much would that be?
- 40,000.
Dollars.
Well, you've just got yourself a deal, brother.
Now, how am I going to get my hands on all this money?
Well, sometime in the next 48 hours, a Mexican is going to bring $50, 000 to Simon for the release
Now all you have to do is figure out some way to keep that
Yeah.
Amos, you go over to the saloon and tell Hamp and Ivy to
What are you going to do, Lew?
I'm going to spit right in Simon's eye.
There's the shack and right behind it you will find a trail that will run you right into Agry Town.
Change your mind about going back?
I was thinking about young Juan.
- It will be sundown
That's bad luck all the way around.
Say, I got some coffee bacon in my pack if you've a mind to eat before you start back.
All right, Lew.
Hop in, kid.
Drive slow out of town, Ivy.
When you get to the shack once, if everything looks all right, you can back as fast as you can
All right, Mex, get out of there.
Ivy, you ride the kid's horse.
- What's the matter, can't you handle him?
Sure you can?
Come on, get up.
Senor, you hurt my horse again, I swear one day I will kill you.
There's supposed to be nobody living in that old shack.
Howdy, fellas, what in tarnation brings you out here?
How come the kid's still alive, I figured he'd be hung
Lew told you he wanted the job done, why didn't you do it that way.
Well, we done just like Lew said.
What's Buchanan's horse doing here.
Only thing you were supposed to bring back with you was a saddle.
Well, after we killed him...
Ain't no sense in my lying to you Waldo, when it come down to that poor dumb animal I just
What did you stop off here for?
- Well, after all that riding we
Where's Lafe?
- He went out hunting he will be back anytime now.
What did you bring him for?
Simon and the kid's pa made a deal with Simon that he'd pay him
Lew figured it don't make no difference to his pa who he paid the money to as long as the kid went on living.
So Lew decided to do a ransom deal.
Looks like Lew's really bucking the big men this time.
Oh, there was bound to have a showdown sooner or later.
Yeah, like you said, it was bound to happen.
Lafe get a boot out of shooting Buchanan?
- Yeah, he got a kick out of it.
Ain't never minded shooting' nobody.
Sit down, kid, if there's any food left over, we'll give you
You three stay like you was.
I never expected to see you again today, Buchanan.
I didn't never expect to see you ever.
Don't move.
You three sit down.
Get the rope.
Throw me the rifle.
Jonny, you and Pecos tie them up, except for Waldo.
Drag 'em off.
Stand up.
Waldo, I've been remembering that fight we had out in the saloon.
How long were you supposed to stay here with Jonny?
Till Lew comes.
Well, what are we gonna do now?
First, tie him up and then fix us some food, then I...
I ain't sure.
When you think Lew will be showing up?
Ain't your toe sore yet?
Lew will be here as soon as he gets the ransom money
Who's this Gomez?
He's ranch foreman for my father.
I hope he's smart enough not to turn the money over
Gomez is very smart, Buchanan.
- Good.
I'll ride with you as far as the border, come on.
Be seein' you.
You cut us loose and I'll forget about you siding with Buchanan.
Oh, you would never forget that, Waldo.
Why, if you got the chance, you'd cut my heart out
Well, like the man said, be seeing you.
Didn't I just say goodbye to you? Yes, sir, you did.
But I've got to think about what I'd do when Lew got here.
Well, what do you want to do?
I know a place where Juan can cross the border without no chance and I'd be much obliged if I could ride along with you.
All right, Pecos.
- But I still ain't going back into Agry Town, ever.
Lew's going to kill us when he finds out the kid got away.
Well, here we are, that's your country.
Guess this is where we part company, Jonny.
Please, do not return to Agry Town.
Come to the hacienda with me,
He will be very happy to make up your losses.
I'll make up my own losses.
I must do something to repay you for all you have done.
If you must go back to Agry Town, let me go with you.
You really want to do something for me?
- Name it and it's done.
Start riding and don't stop till you get home.
He named it, kid.
- So long, Jonny.
Pecos, ride a ways to see that he keeps going south.
I will be waiting right here for you, Buchanan, and good luck.
Juan!
What's the matter with you?
- I couldn't have missed him.
Look at Buchanan leaving.
You know something, Jonny?
Looks like this time I let my big mouth talk me into real trouble.
Tell Buchanan...
All right, boy, mount up.
We're going back to town.
Lew, I want to know what's holding up the hanging'.
Simon's orders.
You all saw how broken up poor Simon
What's that got to do with it?
If your son was killed you'd want to see his murderer
You'll just have to wait until Simon's feeling better.
Simon.
Simon, wake up.
I know the funeral's been a chore, but I think this might make you feel better,
Your Money Man's here.
I have fulfilled your wish, senor. Fine.
Now if you'll just turn over the money.
I will turn over the money when you turn over Juan de la Vega.
What's the matter, don't you trust me?
- No, senor.
How do you know you can trust him?
We haven't seen the money, how do we know he's got it?
And I believe you.
Carbo, bring the boy back here.
Senor Gomez, as you say in Spanish, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.
Lew!
Carbo just pulled up behind the jail, I think he's lookin' for you!
But...
Amos, ever since this happened you've been running around like a
How about I buy you a drink?
Lew.
What do you want, Carbo?
Keys to the jail cells.
Oh, sure.
Lew, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
You'd better make it right before it's too late.
- I ain't made no mistake.
I ain't goin' no place.
- We're going to Simon's.
Now, what would Simon and me have to hash over?
Where's the kid? Ah.
Well, you just tell Senor Gomez that if he's got any trading to do
I'm the man to see, because Simon ain't got nothin' to trade.
You know, Carbo, now that I've gone into business for myself I might not have time for this sheriff business any more.
You keep this up, Lew, you're going to wind up in a box alongside Roy.
Hah!
Put your hands on the top of the desk.
And, Sheriff, would you mind opening up that safe?
You kill me, Buchanan, ain't nobody going to open that safe.
You know something, Sheriff, it just might be worth it.
Hand me my gun belt.
Gentle.
Haul out my money and count it over here on the table.
Put it in stacks of $500, it'll be quicker that way. Lew!
Everybody's getting riled up, they're going to come down here...
Ahh...
Hello, Amos.
Give Lew a hand counting' up my money.
How much is there?
1,700.
You'd better start diggin'.
Get out with that 50, Amos.
It's all that's left, Buchanan.
- Put it back in my belt.
Amos, you were saying something when you came in.
Because we ain't hung the kid yet.
They say if Lew don't they will.
Lew, you'd better get on back up to the saloon, looks like you're gonna have to do some mighty fast talkin'.
Lew, Lew!
what do you think they're gonna do when find out the kid in jail?
They won't find out till after I get that 50,000.
- What are you gonna do?
Find Gomez.
It's time we talked business.
- How are you gonna find Gomez?
Very simple, I'm going to look for him.
if he wants that kid back, he just might be looking for me!
Lew. We've waited long enough.
And we ain't waiting' any longer.
If you don't get on with it, the men will take care of it themselves.
That's what I come in here for.
You all know Simon won't like missing the hanging, so we'll wait, but if he don't show up soon we'll go ahead without him.
Whiskey for everybody on me, Nacho.
Drink up, fellas, I'll be back.
Set 'em up, Nacho.
OK, drink up, everybody.
I thought I told you to go home.
I couldn't help it, Buchanan.
That's right, he couldn't help it.
Now you can do one of two things.
You make a break for it and we shoot you both in the back or you can toss over them guns.
Go get the keys.
We're sure making' progress.
Buchanan, they killed Pecos.
What are you all doin' here?
- We had a little trouble.
Where's Lew?
He's in jail with Buchanan.
I asked you where Lew was.
I cannot understand why you do not deliver Juan to me, senor.
We can't deliver the boy in broad daylight, the town's
I am impatient, senor.
I have fulfilled my part of the contract.
I will leave now.
When you are ready to return Juan to me, you will discover
Might as well face it, Simon, you're going to have to kiss
Lew's holding the trump card.
Lew never saw the day he could outfox me.
And nobody ever saw me kiss $50,000 goodbye.
Come in.
Well, Amos, what is it?
- Well, I was just lookin' for Lew.
You were?
You should have known better than to
Mixed up in what?
I haven't got any time to waste.
Where's Lew hiding the kid?
What are you talkin' about?
I don't know what...
Now, where's the kid?
In jail.
- Don't lie to me!
I'm not lyin' to you!
He's back in jail, I'm tellin' you the truth.
I believe you, Amos.
Does Lew know he's back? I don't think so.
He's lookin' for Gomez.
I was just lookin' for Lew.
Thank you, Amos.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
You kept us waitin' a long time, Simon.
It's about time we stretched
Hold on, we can't have an official hanging until the sheriff is there.
Where is Lew?
- He's in the back room.
You won't be able to talk 'em out of a hanging this time.
After we get the money, that's Lew's responsibility.
Well, I...
Senor Gomez, you would be a very foolish man to believe anything
Gomez, don't let the judge here smooth-talk you.
He don't know
He's in jail, where he's always been.
Now, if you'll just hand over the saddle bag, I promise you that
I will hand the money over to no-one until the boy is handed over to me.
Come on, Simon, what's keeping you and Lew?
- How long do we have to wait, Lew? !
Now, I don't blame you for being impatient.
We'll be right there.
If you believe me, you lose your $50,000 and save the boy's life.
If you believe Lew, Juan dies.
Well, which way's it gonna be?
I will believe you only when I see the boy.
All right, Senor Gomez.
Why don't you walk with him over to the jail?
Incidentally, I've authorised Mr Carbo to receive the money
Well, Lew, I wonder which one of us is going to be right.
See Lew?
Lew, can I see you a min...
Waldo, you're a fool!
Simon? Turns out that you were right.
But I think we can change that.
- Let go of me, Lew!
Juan, I'm letting you go.
I didn't expect to find you here, Buchanan.
Come on.
We could use a gun.
Hey!
Excuse me, senor.
The carriage!
Buchanan!
Get up!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, you'll hit Simon!
Buchanan, look.
Lew, look, the saddle bag!
Lew... bring out Gomez.
Gomez is all right.
Lew Agry? I hear ya!
- Tell everybody to move back up the street,
If you don't, I'm gonna shoot the judge.
That ain't no loss.
You heard him!
He means it, Lew!
- And if we do you're releasing Simon?
You have my word on it.
All right, Gomez, beat it.
If he makes a move for that saddle bag, shoot him.
Hold it.
Buchanan, he isn't going any further until you let Simon go.
Tell him not to get nervous, Judge.
Let him keep on walking, Lew!
All right, Gomez, move on.
Juan!
Judge, now you go on out there, pick up that saddle bag
Pick it up and come right back!
Run this way, Simon!
Come on!
Now, Lew, you got any more ideas on how to get that saddle bag?
Yeah.
A real good one.
Oh, no.
Don't look my way, Lew.
Why not?
You can run faster than Simon, you ought to be able to
Just like you did the judge?
Oh, no.
No, Lew, not me either.
Suit yourself.
But if you don't I'll kill you right here.
Don't shoot, Buchanan! D...
Don't shoot!
That's far enough.
Now bend slow and pick up
I can't, Buchanan.
Lew will kill me.
Do as I tell you or I will!
Hold it, Buchanan.
Drop that gun and stand up.
Get up!
You've just gone and saved us the trouble of a hanging.
Lew, I can't let you do to Buchanan what you did to Simon.
What are you talkin' about?
- Murder.
There were those on this side that saw it, Lew, they'd swear to it.
Drop your gun, Lew.
- My own brother?
Lew...
Never should have crossed Simon.
I'll take those.
- Not after all the trouble I've gone to.
Anyway, it looks like this is your town now.
There you are, Jonny.
Gracias.
Buchanan, when you have a Mexican as a friend, you must allow him to
My horse is your horse.
No, Jonny.
- Please, Buchanan.
This time I promise I will go straight home.
Adios.
- Adios.
I don't think anybody'll try to stop him this time.
Do you, Carbo?
Under the circumstances?
Where do you think you're going?
- West Texas.
Good, I'd advise you not to stay here.
Like you say, this is my town now.
Mr Carbo... you can have it.
Don't just stand there, Amos.
Hurry along there, please.
Hurry along now.
We're late already.
Right, that's the lot.
I said that's the lot.
Vie Bushell!
Well, I'm blowed.
Remember me?
Stockwell Road School?
- Shelly Wilson.
- That's right.
Dyed my hair.
Suits the uniform.
Well, I never!
- How are you keeping?
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.
Well, isn't this nice?
My first day on this route and I pick you up.
Do you still live around here?
Oh, yes.
Just around the corner from the old school.
And do you work out west?
- So do we.
We want to get there this morning.
Come on, we've got to get to work.
Really, the manners of people these days.
Room for one more inside.
Sorry, that's the lot.
Say, Vie?
Vie?
- Hello.
- Hello, love.
I've just taken a minute off.
I had to come and tell you.
I've just seen Sally Wilkins.
She's joined the act.
Thank heavens.
We won.
Can you come out in Hyde Park with me Saturday afternoon?
Yes, why?
Well, I've got to try and pick up a French soldier.
Eh?
Well, it's a French national holiday and Mom thought it would be a good idea to find a French soldier and bring him back for supper.
I wish I had a French mother.
Well, will you come?
What on Earth do you want me with you for?
Well, I mean...
Well, I couldn't go on my own.
Oh, all right.
But as long as you do all the talking.
'Cause I don't know enough French even to say no.
This jewelry's imitation.
There you are.
Over there.
- Oh, no.
They're not French.
- Oh, aren't they?
Look, Win.
They're French.
I don't think we're cut out for this work, Vie.
You know, we'll probably finish up getting arrested.
Do you mean they'll think we're...
Oh, crikey.
Oh, dear.
There you are.
He's looking at you, Vie.
- He's a French officer, isn't he? - Mmm-hmm.
- In the Foreign Legion.
- Is he really?
Oh, isn't that romantic, Vie?
What do we do now?
Wait?
Your pardon, mademoiselle, have you the time, if you please?
The time?
Oh, it's...
Oh, blimey, I don't know.
What's the time, Vie?
I'm sorry, mademoiselle.
- Now I speak English. - That's all right.
Is it permitted that I sit down?
Oh, yes. Yes, sit down.
Well, go on, Vie, ask him.
Well, it's just that my mother thought that if you've got nothing to do, you'd like to come back and have supper with us.
But, mademoiselle, I don't know your mother.
Oh, that doesn't matter.
What?
Oh, I understand.
She sent you to seek a lonely Frenchman, that she might entertain him.
Will you come?
Why not?
I beg your pardon, mademoiselle...
Well, I'm Violette Bushell and this is Winnie Watson.
Mademoiselle.
Now we all know each other, don't we?
Oh, please.
I bet you haven't heard this one. It's terrific.
- I got it from one of the boys last week.
- There we are.
Another glass of wine like the officers have.
I wish health to you, monsieur.
And you, madame, and to the charming Mademoiselle Violette.
Hear, hear.
I'm so glad Violette found you.
It's been a lovely evening.
- Hasn't it, Charles?
- First class.
The luck was for me.
I'm so happy.
Such fine stories of your adventures.
If I had been a man, I'd like to have been a professional soldier.
All those wonderful places you've seen.
Algiers.
Tunis.
Morocco.
Did you have a rough time getting out of Dunkirk?
Oh, please, sir, one day, perhaps.
Maybe we dance, mademoiselle?
Yes.
Excuse me, madame.
I think your parents are very charming.
- Where were you born? England?
- Yes, I was born in London.
But my parents met in France. The last war.
I understand.
I say, look at Vie.
It's the first time I've ever seen her take an interest in a boy.
She may be my sister, chum, but I'm warning you, she's a terror with the boys.
Well, you asked for it, Roy.
Now you've got it.
I'm sorry. Music!
Start the music!
Quick!
Bully.
There you are.
The toughest one in the family.
- Will you have another drink?
- No, thank you, madame.
If you will excuse me, I must get back now.
I'm on duty tonight.
Perhaps... Perhaps, in the next days you will teach me something of London?
If you will permit, madame.
- But of course.
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Well, I'll just walk along with...
- No. No. No, Charles.
Bye-bye, Etienne.
Good cheer. Hope for the best.
Nice knowing you.
- Good night, monsieur.
- Good night.
Good night, mademoiselle.
I'll fetch your cap.
Come on, Dad, how about a sing-song?
What shall we have?
- My Old Dutch.
- My Old Dutch.
My Old Dutch.
All right, off we go.
We've been together now for 40 years
And it don't seem a day too much
7:00, tomorrow, Hyde Park?
The same seat.
I shall remember.
I'll try not to be late.
Good night, Violette.
Au revoir, Etienne.
You look very sweet in the moonlight.
What are you thinking?
I was pretending that we were in the south of France sitting in a lovely hotel, looking out at the sea.
From my home in Marseilles, I could look at the sea.
Oh, I'd love to go to Marseilles.
And Monte Carlo.
When we are married, we will go together.
And to Paris.
Have you been to Paris?
I used to go over the summer when I was a kid and stay with relations, but that was in the country.
It's the most wonderful city in the world.
Paris.
The trees in the bois.
The shops in the Champs-Elysees.
In the spring it is fairyland.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were here.
- I...
Hey!
Put that light out!
I'm sorry, Dad.
I forgot about the curtains.
That's all right.
I was looking for my pipe.
- I'm sorry, monsieur.
I should have gone.
- Yes, well, it is getting on.
Vie, your mother wants you in the kitchen.
What for?
I don't know.
She wants you. Get along now.
- Well, now, Etienne...
- Monsieur, I wish to say something.
Well, all right.
You know, I have known Violette only a little time.
Soon I go away.
- Yes, well, that's just it...
- Please, Monsieur Bushell, please.
I wish to say...
Please, monsieur, I want your permission to marry your daughter.
Marry her? You want to marry her?
- Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you.
- Hey, steady on.
Not so fast.
This wants thinking about, you know.
- But we are sure, monsieur.
- You may be sure, but, well, damn it all, old man, you've only known the girl for three days.
But monsieur, it is not time that tells these things, but the heart.
We love each other.
No, no, it won't do.
She's too young.
I'm not having it.
- Oh, aren't you?
- Now, Vie.
I'm sorry, Dad, but Etienne and I are going to get married.
- Monsieur Bushell...
- He asked you first 'cause he's French, and he thought he ought to, but it won't make any difference.
Oh, won't it?
- No, it won't.
- Oh?
Well, all right then.
Oh, Dad!
- Oh, Etienne!
- Violette.
There we are, Madame Szabo.
A week ago today we were on our way here.
We celebrate the occasion tonight with champagne.
Oh, darling.
Please, darling, don't look anymore.
When the honeymoon is over, we go back to the war.
See those trees over there?
I'll race you to them.
All right.
Violette?
Violette?
Did you call?
Make way for me. I'm coming up.
Too late. I'm coming down.
- Oh, darling.
- Are you happy?
How long can we stay?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I was just thinking how very much I love you.
Darling, will you laugh at me if I tell you something?
Last night when you were asleep, I wrote a little poem about my love for you.
A poem?
Oh, it's not very good, but...
Well, the words came into my mind and I wrote them down.
Here.
You read it.
I... I want to hear you read it.
I think I remember it.
"The life that I have Is all that I have
"And the life that I have Is yours
"The love that I have Of the life that I have
"Is yours and yours and yours
"A sleep I shall have A rest I shall have
"Yet death will be but a pause
"For the peace of my years
"In the long green grass
"Will be yours and yours and yours"
That's all of it.
Thank you, darling.
It's beautiful.
- Etienne?
- Well?
You didn't answer my question.
How long can we stay here?
I heard this morning in two days we must return.
In three days, I go.
Where?
Overseas.
I don't know where.
Oh, Violette, my darling, you know this must be.
Yes,
I know.
It can't be helped.
We've still got three days.
Oh, you will come back, won't you?
Of course I shall come back.
Soon the war will be finished.
Then, we have another honeymoon.
We'll go together to Notre Dame and give thanks.
What shall we have first, a girl or a boy?
We shall have a girl.
Then we'll take her with us to Paris, and I shall buy for her the prettiest little dress in the world.
- You know, I think I'd rather have a boy.
- No. I insist upon a girl.
Then she will grow up to look just like you.
And I shall be twice as proud.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Dear Tania
Happy birthday to you
Very good.
Come, everyone, have something to eat.
Would you like to finish up the chocolate pie?
Oh, she's sweet, Vie. Really, she is.
- Have a biscuit, Win?
- Oh, thank you, love.
What a shame Etienne hasn't seen her yet.
Well, I was hoping he'd get special leave, but when I heard he was in North Africa, I knew there wasn't much hope.
How is he?
Have you heard from him?
No.
No, I haven't. Not for some time.
I've been a bit worried, really.
Well, letters take a long time to come, don't they, lovey?
- Isn't Tania gonna cut her cake?
- Oh, yes.
And you know what they say.
No news is good news.
Come on, darling, stand up.
Cut the cake, come on.
- Very good.
- Well done.
And now the other side.
Oh, you are a clever girl.
Now, first plate, please. There we are.
Oh, thanks.
Mom, could you answer it?
Yes.
Mrs. Szabo.
- Mr. Potter, please.
- Fourth floor.
Thank you.
Mrs. Szabo.
Good morning.
My name's Potter.
Come and sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
Well, I suppose you're wondering why I sent for you?
I expect it's about the pension.
I understand you're partly French, Mrs. Szabo.
My mother is French.
And your husband was in the French army?
Yes.
He was killed at El Alamein six months ago.
Yes.
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
You... You speak French yourself, of course?
Yes.
I was brought up to speak French and English.
And you're quite an athlete, I'm told.
And you are something of a crack shot with a rifle.
Mr. Potter, if it's about the pension, then I really don't...
Well, actually, Mrs. Szabo, it's not about the pension.
- But you wrote to me.
- Yes, I know.
Ministry of Pensions.
That's not correct.
I belong to quite a different department.
Well, if it's not about the pension, why am I here?
Because I think that you have certain qualifications which might be of great use.
Qualifications?
What for?
The war effort.
I must tell you at once.
It comes under the heading of dangerous work.
Look, I... I really don't think you've got hold of the right person...
What kind of work?
Well, briefly, we're doing everything we can to make things as difficult for the Germans as we can, in every way that we can, from blowing up their troop trains, to putting chalk in their ink.
The French are magnificent, of course.
But they have to be organized and supplied.
We need liaison people.
- It's quite a job. - Yes.
Yes, I suppose it is.
One more thing.
The Germans don't like what we're doing.
They don't like it at all.
In certain circumstances, they react violently.
And brutally.
Well, now, are you interested?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Since your husband died, you've rather shut yourself away from everybody, haven't you?
Oh, we have to make some fairly close inquiries before we interview people for this sort of work.
Oh, yes, I see.
Well, I just couldn't seem to face up to things.
Quite.
But you're picking up the threads again now, aren't you?
I'm trying to.
Good.
Well, I'd like you to turn this over in your mind.
I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, I...
I really don't think I can be of any use to you.
I suppose you're thinking about your baby?
Well, she's all I have.
What if anything happened to me?
Yes, of course.
Well, that's something that you must think about.
But you don't have to make up your mind right away.
Why don't you come and see me again in a week's time?
Yes.
Yes, all right.
If you wish.
You do realize that you must tell nobody about this interview?
Nobody at all.
Not even your parents.
Yes, of course.
Mr. Potter, wouldn't it be possible to find someone else for this job?
I don't know. It might be possible.
But, you see, it's taken us a long time to find you.
There are so few people with your qualifications.
Oh, just a moment.
Don't forget your pass.
Otherwise, you'll be here forever.
Oh, good afternoon.
My name's Vera Atkins.
I'm looking for Mrs. Szabo.
Oh, that's me.
- Will you come in?
- Thank you.
You don't know me, but I'm working in the same department as Mr. Potter.
- Oh.
Would you come in here, please?
- Thank you.
Mr. Potter got your letter.
He just wanted me to see you to make sure that you understand the step you're taking.
Well, I've thought about it for two weeks and
I know now it's the only thing I can do.
You realize your decision is entirely voluntary?
No pressure will be used.
- I still want to join.
- Good.
- Will you sit down? - Thank you.
Oh, what a dear little girl.
- It's Tania, isn't it?
- Yes.
How old is she?
Just over two.
And yet you still want to do this?
My husband was killed fighting in the desert.
For his sake, I...
I couldn't live the rest of my life knowing I failed to do my bit.
He never saw Tania, but I suppose, in a way,
he was fighting for her.
And now it's my turn.
You do realize it may end the same way for you?
Yes, I do realize that.
Right.
The first thing to do is to get you into uniform.
Then you won't be asked awkward questions about what you're doing.
You'll be commissioned as an officer in the FANYs.
Can you start at once?
Oh, yes.
My mother will look after Tania.
Good.
- May we come in?
- Of course, Mom.
Hello, darling.
Oh!
Did you have a nice walk?
- Oh, this is my mother, Miss Atkins.
- How do you do?
- And my father.
- How do you do?
Pleased to meet you, Miss Atkins.
What do you think? I'm going into the FANYs.
What?
You mean you've joined up?
What is the FANYs?
Oh, uh, First Aid Nursing Yeomanry.
You know, driving ambulances, running canteens, that sort of thing.
- Yes, that's right.
- Oh, well.
That sounds a nice job.
Look, miss, you're gonna fight the Germans.
You're gonna help us win the war, right?
Yes.
That's a very clever girl.
Now, we'll try again.
This is the best of the bunch?
I can't stand it.
I'm going to be sick.
All right, now, I'm a Jerry, you see.
And I'm coming toward you.
Right, now, here I come.
Pay attention over there.
I'm not doing this for my benefit.
Look, miss, I...
Never mind.
Get back in the line.
It ain't fair.
Ladies, I've told you.
I've told you time and time again.
When you fall, fall properly.
Then you don't hurt yourselves.
Oh, it's very simple.
A child could do it.
Watch me.
- Lf only he'd break his bloody neck. - Mmm.
- Finished?
- Yes.
All right.
Get going.
Good evening, ladies.
You quite comfortable?
I suppose you're waiting for the bang.
- Yes.
- Yes.
And in the meantime, if I'd have been a German sentry, I could have come over there, knocked you two off, gone over to that bridge, unplugged the fuse, and gone over and had me dinner.
- Have you got a revolver?
-Yes.
Tell me where it is.
In the holster.
You're keeping it warm, I suppose?
The number of times I've told you!
Never leave yourselves undefended!
Give me a hand here, will you?
What's the matter with you?
We've got you, Sergeant.
Don't worry.
Put that away.
You might do some harm with it.
Well, that was really good.
You can all go back to base now.
Can we come back in the lorry with you, Sergeant?
No, you can walk.
But it's seven miles.
Eight.
Give you a nice appetite for breakfast, won't it?
Driver!
Appetite for breakfast.
How far are we from base now?
About two miles.
See where we are?
We're in Commando HQ.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a nice, hot cup of tea.
Wouldn't you prefer a whiskey?
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Come on.
What the devil do you think you're...
Quick!
Get him in here!
Onto the bed.
Tuck him up. That's it.
You've knocked out the CO.
He's waking up.
It's one thing to live off the land.
That's part of your training.
But it's another to make an irresponsible raid on government property, and steal government liquor and damage government personnel.
It'll be up before the CO this morning.
All right, now, who's responsible?
- I am, Sergeant.
- No.
Oh, no, all of us.
We're equally responsible.
Okay. Okay.
All right.
Well, I can tell you here and now, the CO's gonna have something to say about this.
Did I say dismissed?
Come back here.
Come back here.
What's the matter with you?
Blimey women.
There's one thing more.
And it gives me pain, great pain to say it.
I'm proud to have you in my section.
I've been trying to put something over on those commandos for a year now.
Go on, you're dismissed.
Oh, by the way, there's an end-of-course party on Thursday night in the mess.
The drinks are on you.
Well, I suppose Winston knows what he's doing.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Keep your legs together.
What are you trying to do, split yourself in two?
I don't know, even the women are better than you are.
That's something I thought I'd never say.
All right, on parade again 1400 hours.
Fall out.
The thing is, you see, I don't like heights.
I get air sick on top of a bus. Oh.
You should have joined the Navy.
- But if you can do it, I suppose I can.
- It's the next course I'm scared of.
The finishing school?
Finish me. All that psychological stuff.
You know what they do?
They invent a new personality for you.
- Yes? - Hmm.
New name. New background. Everything.
What about your present background?
Do you live in London?
No exchange of personal information.
Security instructions sub-clause 144-a.
You're learning fast.
Do you know the Studio Club?
It's in Knightsbridge.
Oh, no, that's not my part of London.
When we're through this, we might meet.
Look at that chap.
I'll never be able to do it like that.
Have a drink?
Do a theater, maybe?
What?
Oh, yes. Yes, we might.
Yes.
See you on the flying trapeze.
Yes.
I wish we could get out and walk.
- You were all right yesterday.
- Beginner's luck.
So far I've landed on everything except my face.
I've got a feeling this is the day.
Right.
We're coming up over the DZ now.
Just remember everything you've been told.
You'll be dropping in a stick of five.
All right, stand by for action.
Action stations!
Go!
Two!
Two!
Five!
I did it! I did it!
Easy. Nothing to it.
What's the matter?
My ankle's gone.
Here. Hang on to me.
I'd say you've got yourself a spot of leave. Oh, no.
I must finish the course.
Oh, no.
Medical orders sub-clause 54-b.
As soon as that's better, I suppose you'll be off again.
Yes, I shall.
Well, the next time you might write your mother a bit more often.
She worries, you know.
- I did write.
- Twice in three months.
And what did you say? Nothing.
And even now, you've been home two weeks and what have you told us?
Helping in canteens, driving lorries.
Do you really think what you're doing's helping to win the war?
I've got to believe it.
Well, I don't believe it.
And what about your spare time? What do you do with that?
You meet men, don't you?
- Sometimes.
- Officers, I suppose?
Yes, officers.
The men I work with.
Sometimes we make up a party, go to a theater or a nightclub or something.
Well, what's wrong with that?
I'm not a child.
You're not much more.
Oh, Dad.
All right, you've been married and you got a baby. But that doesn't mean you know it all, you know.
Look, Vie.
I don't know what it is, but you've changed.
You used to tell us everything.
I wish you'd live at home with us instead of racketing around all over the place.
I can't. I've got to get around.
It's part of my work. What?
And crock yourself up like that?
Look. I told you, I twisted it jumping out of a lorry.
Now, what does that prove?
That I'm having a mad flirtation with a colonel?
Well, I don't know what to think.
Oh, don't be so stupid.
All right.
You do what you like.
But I tell you this, my girl, if you're not careful, you'll come to a bad end.
Now, you mark my words.
Thanks.
What's wrong, Charles?
It's Vie's.
Fell out of her bag.
What is it?
A parachute badge.
That's how she hurt her ankle.
Thanks.
It fell out of your bag.
I spoke out of turn, didn't I?
I'm sorry, Vie.
Have you got much more of it to do?
I'm sorry, Dad, I can't tell you anything.
I'm not allowed to.
It's okay, Vie.
I can guess what the job is.
And I'm sure you're doing it for a good reason.
Yes, I am.
Fair enough.
No more questions.
And if you get a chance to have a bit of fun, you take it, bless you.
Very nice.
I hope you mean it.
It's taken me four weeks to get you here.
Now, what about tomorrow night?
- Well, we can't plan as far ahead as that.
- Oh, pity.
That's the worst of war, no time.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
New places, new faces.
Just when you're getting to like one particular face.
I wonder if that isn't the best of war.
No time to get attached.
I see.
Tony, I'd like to ask you something some time.
No time like the present.
Let's go outside.
Cooler out here.
And quieter.
- Tony... - Mmm-hmm.
Do you think I can do this job?
Don't you?
I don't know.
I get frightened.
You got through your training all right?
Yes, I know. But when it comes to the real thing.
If it does, shall I feel the same?
It's so important not to fail.
You won't fail.
You'll do a grand job.
Oh, I want to. I want to so much.
Don't worry too much about it.
We're all in the same boat.
None of us really knows how he'll stand up to it until the time comes.
I'm just afraid of being afraid.
- It sounds silly.
- I know.
The thing is to face up to that one and accept it.
Then you'll be able to control it.
Yes.
Yes, I see that.
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.
Oh, goodness.
We are being serious, aren't we?
All right, let's go and dance then.
Well, if this is true, it's damn bad luck.
Rouen group was one of our best.
- What are we gonna do about it?
- We'll just have to have another try.
I'm sending Fraser into France again.
- Fraser?
- Yes, why not?
- He formed the Rouen group originally. - Yes.
Yes, I know.
What's wrong? Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
It's just a personal reaction.
I find him rather a strange chap.
Seems so remote.
That's why he's such a good agent.
He doesn't have to work at it 24 hours a day.
Hello, Fraser.
How'd you like the parachute course?
I didn't, sir.
Give me a nice French train every time.
Well, you've seen the signal.
Yes.
Vera showed it to me.
Are you sure it's genuine?
It's from Paris.
Absolutely reliable.
The trouble is the lack of detail.
Somebody's talked.
There have been arrests.
That's all we know for certain.
Well, we'll soon know the truth.
It can be very dangerous for you, Tony.
Your face is plastered all over Rouen.
You're bound to be recognized in a town of 1 16,000.
One hundred sixteen thousand four hundred and sixty-seven, to be precise. Look.
I'm the only one that knows all the contacts.
If there has been a roundup, we may have to begin again from scratch.
And time's short.
That whole area right through to the coast is solid with Gestapo.
- It's worth trying, surely. - No.
I don't think it is.
I've got a better idea.
I'm going to send somebody over with you.
You can stay out of Rouen itself.
Your assistant can go in and discover what's going on, reporting to you as and when necessary.
- Agreed?
- Lf you say so, sir, of course.
It will have to be somebody good.
It will be tricky.
They'll be working blind.
- Who are you giving me? - Vera.
Come in, will you?
- Hello.
How are you? - Fine.
Thank you.
You know each other, of course.
Yes, but...
It seemed to us a woman would be less liable to suspicion in Rouen than a man.
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, I suppose so.
I've already explained the mission briefly to Violette.
She's confident she can carry out your instructions.
- I hope so.
- I'm sure she can.
- Quite sure.
- Good.
Well, Captain Fraser knows the area well.
In fact, he organized the Rouen group.
So you, in turn, can rely on him.
Yes.
I see.
Well, come and look at the map.
If only you can find one or two of your old contacts and a bit of explosive, that will be something.
- What's in your mind, sir?
- Look.
Here's the main railway line from Germany through Rouen to Le Havre.
It's in constant use by the Boche.
West of Rouen the line crosses a viaduct.
This must be blown.
Yes, I know that viaduct.
Well, let's get down to details.
With luck we can get you over at the next moon.
Your identity card.
Clothing coupons.
Ration cards and money,
600 pounds in French francs.
Will you sign for them here, please?
If you want any more, I can let you have some.
I've never been so rich in my life.
I've checked through your toilet things.
It's all right, I see you've used them.
- Yes, last week. - Good.
You're quite safe with them.
- I'll check your handbag. - Oh.
Right.
Well, how do I look?
The perfect secretary.
I hate this jacket.
That's worn this year in Rouen.
You can't check the rest of me, but I assure you, it's all French.
That's fair enough.
Just one other thing.
Your lethal pill.
Just in case of accidents.
Keep it somewhere safe and handy.
No, thanks.
I don't have to have it, do I?
- Well, no, but...
- It's all right.
Anyway, they're not going to catch me.
As you wish.
Cigarettes, matches, a picture of a child.
- These you have to leave behind.
- All right.
Oh, just one more English cigarette.
Well, this is where it really starts.
Yes.
How do you feel?
A bit sort of unreal.
I know.
I did the first time.
All those months of training, blood and sweat and tears, building up, you think, to a tremendously exciting climax, and suddenly here you are, in the middle of the night, with your little suitcase,
trotting off in a tiny unarmed aircraft, to fight the German army all by yourself.
Crazy, isn't it?
Crazy.
Come on.
They're waiting to kiss us goodbye.
- Bon voyage, Colonel. - Thank you.
Monsieur Dumont, it is good to see you again.
Good to see you.
- This is Mademoiselle Luran.
- Welcome, mademoiselle.
Can you get her to Rouen as quickly as possible?
- You can ride a bicycle? - Yes.
We will take her to friends nearby, and in the morning she can board the train for Rouen.
Good.
It's no good telling you where to start in Rouen.
You'll just have to use your wits.
You've got the names and addresses. Yes.
I only hope one of them is still there.
If you can get the viaduct blown up, good.
But don't take any unnecessary risks.
I'm relying on you to get back to me to report.
Yes, of course.
We'll meet then in Paris, as arranged, three weeks from now.
That's the 28th.
I'll be there.
Good luck, mademoiselle.
And you, monsieur.
We have a car waiting, monsieur.
Why not come in here, mademoiselle?
We have a seat too many.
Oh, thank you very much.
May I offer you a cigarette? No.
No, thank you.
- Do you mind if we smoke?
- Please do. Cigarette?
- Are you going through to Rouen?
- Yes.
You work in the war? - No.
I'm visiting relatives.
- I see.
What kind of work do you do?
Oh, I'm just a secretary.
Oh, that's very interesting.
My little daughter, she wants to be a secretary.
- Oh, really?
- Photograph here of her.
Yes. Isn't she pretty?
Here is a photograph of my wife and my children.
Mademoiselle, where do your relatives live?
I don't know.
I'm going to find them.
Do you have somewhere to stay?
I shall stay in a hotel. Thank you.
But mademoiselle, you will find accommodations very difficult in war.
I stay in a small hotel.
I could find you a room there.
I'd rather not. Thank you.
In any case, I must look for my relatives.
But I can find them so much more quickly than you can.
I insist that you allow me to help you.
Very well, monsieur. Thank you.
Right this way.
Have you a room for mademoiselle?
Certainly, monsieur.
The usual room for you, monsieur?
Annette?
Mademoiselle, I should be pleased if you would dine with me tonight.
- Thank you.
- Here at 8:00?
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.
This way, mademoiselle.
- I have a message for Madame Burno.
- She's not here.
Is Monsieur Burno here?
Neither my mother nor my father are here.
Well, what time will they be back?
I must see them urgently.
They've been taken by the Germans.
And I don't want to be seen talking to you.
Well, you're my last contact, madame.
None of the others have been able to help me.
How many of the group are left?
If I knew, I would tell you.
But I don't.
I only know that many have been caught.
I'm trying to trace a Monsieur Garnier.
Garnier?
He works at Berto's Garage.
- Where's that?
- In the Rue du Bognet.
But be careful.
We are not too sure of him.
- Berto's Garage, Rue du Bognet. - Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
Yes, I'll be careful.
- Monsieur Garnier? - Hmm?
Can I hire a bicycle here?
No, mademoiselle, no.
Oh.
Is there anywhere else in Rouen I could try?
Not that I know of.
Oh, well, never mind.
It's a nice day for walking.
It's good that the spring is here at last.
Yes.
It has been a long winter.
And now the days are drawing out.
What do you want to know?
How many of the group are left?
It's a tragedy, mademoiselle.
Of 98 members, only myself and two others remain.
That's terrible.
- Have you any explosive?
- Yes.
Plenty. Do you know how to use it? You and the other two?
No. We are watched all the time, mademoiselle.
The Gestapo.
What is the target?
It's the viaduct that carries the main line to Le Havre, 20 kilometers west of here.
The viaduct?
But it's guarded night and day.
Will you try?
I'll speak to the others.
- You must not stay here.
- When will you see them?
- Tonight.
Perhaps tomorrow.
- Tonight. - But mademoiselle, I...
- Please.
I'll call back in the morning.
But mademoiselle, you just don't realize...
I know that if it's possible, you'll do it.
Your name?
- Corinne Reine-Leroy.
- Address?
64 Rue Thiers, Le Havre.
Your papers.
What are you doing in Rouen?
I'm trying to find some relatives.
At Berto's Garage?
- I wanted to hire a bicycle.
- And did you hire one?
No. No, he said he had none.
Took him a very long time to tell you that.
He's a talkative man.
- You come with us.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler.
This woman was talking to the man Garnier at Berto's Garage.
I suspect that he was passing information to her.
This is a surprise, mademoiselle.
- Good morning.
- You know each other, Herr Oberst?
Yes.
A chair.
You will understand, mademoiselle, that we must take precautions.
I'm sure you meant no harm, but why were you talking to the man at the garage?
It's very simple.
I was trying to hire a bicycle.
As I told you, I'm trying to find some relatives, and...
Well, I just got tired of walking.
The garage has no bicycles for hire, yet they talked for several minutes.
I thought it quite possible the man might know of my relatives and, perhaps, give me some news of them.
And did he?
Well, he knew my uncle by name, but...
Well, that's all.
Yes.
And what is your uncle's name?
Gromier.
Marcel Gromier.
Herr Oberst, the woman is lying.
Isn't that for you to decide?
Well, mademoiselle, it appears that my men have been a little, shall we say, overzealous.
Please accept my apologies.
By the way, what happened last night?
You promised to dine with me.
I waited over an hour.
Oh? Yes, I'm so sorry.
I got caught in the air raid.
Yes, of course.
Then you'll dine with me tonight instead?
- That would be charming.
- Excellent.
- At 8:00 then?
- Good.
She has tricked you, Herr Oberst.
You don't understand.
I understand perfectly.
Do you really think I can be fooled as easily as that?
Do you think she was receiving information?
Probably.
- Shall we have her followed?
- No. Not yet.
Not until...
Not until after dinner tonight.
Well, if he thinks I'm having dinner with him tonight, he's got a long wait ahead of him.
You're quite sure he suspects?
Yes, I'm quite sure.
He was so ready to believe me.
And much too quick with his invitation to dinner.
Did Monsieur Garnier help you at the garage?
I think he will.
Don't know.
I don't know what to make of him.
You realize, my child, you're in great danger.
You must get out of Rouen by 8:00 tonight.
Yes.
I've got to get to Paris.
I think I can help you.
Bonjour, Corinne.
Bonjour, Robert.
Come and sit down here.
Right on time.
Good girl.
Oh, it's good to see you.
- You're looking tired.
I'm all right, though.
Well, what's the news?
In brief for now.
It's not good.
The Rouen group's had it, I'm afraid.
Three left out of 98.
And I'm not sure of them.
But you got the viaduct?
What?
The viaduct.
It went up last night.
- Didn't you know?
- He did it!
Garnier did it!
He certainly did.
Blew it sky high.
With an ammo train on it.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Let's go find some lunch.
Will we go home tonight?
Not for two or three days.
I'll have to fix the plane.
Take a look at Paris.
Try to do some shopping.
Or have you done it?
It's the most marvelous dress.
I couldn't resist it.
Black market, of course.
Terribly expensive.
- I've mortgaged my pay for months.
- Where'd you get it?
Molyneux.
Molyneux.
But that's where all the Germans take their girlfriends.
Is it?
Oh.
Oh, look.
I must get that for Tania.
But my dear girl, you're broke.
Oh, you said you'd lend me some if I ran out.
But that was in an emergency.
Well, what do you think this is?
Why do they let women into the Army?
Here, help yourself.
Thank you.
Look.
There's a restaurant.
I'll go and get a table.
Yes, I won't be long.
We shall have a girl.
Then we'll take her with us to Paris, and I shall buy for her the prettiest little dress in the world.
Soon the war will be finished.
Then we'll go together to Notre Dame and give thanks.
End of the journey.
I'm so tired I could sleep for a week.
Violette, enjoy your rest.
- You've deserved it.
- So have you.
Oh, it will be wonderful to wake up in the morning without that tight feeling in the stomach.
We might not get the chance to work together again.
You know, ships that pass in the night, that sort of thing.
I hope we won't lose sight of each other.
Of course not.
After all we've been through together?
You can't get rid of me so easily, you know.
Right.
That's settled.
Ring you tomorrow morning.
Oh, you're hopeless.
God bless you.
Good night.
Tania?
Darling?
Hello, darling.
Hello.
Mommy's back.
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.
Would you like to see the lovely thing I brought for you?
Come on, then.
Come on, then.
Oh, what a good girl.
Come on.
Just for two minutes.
Oh, Violette, darling!
Hey, hold on. Hold on.
What about my turn?
Hello, Dad.
- Oh, Vie, I've got so much to ask you.
- No questions, Charles.
Oh, come on. Let's go and have a cup of tea, shall we?
Yes, of course.
No sleep tonight, Mother.
Oh, I have missed you, darling.
- Have you missed me?
- Of course she hasn't.
She's been as naughty as you used to be.
Dad, could you bring in the other things, please?
All right.
Come on.
There.
Oh, it's lovely to be home.
Well, things haven't changed much, Vie.
- No.
They're just the same.
- Good. Now, you sit there, darling.
We're going to open this box and see what I've brought back for you.
Yes.
Just like Christmas, eh?
- You open that one, Dad.
- I'll open this, yes.
Now, what have we got here?
Stand up, darling.
Let me see if it fits you.
Oh, it's too big.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes.
No, it's too big, darling.
Well, never mind.
You'll soon grow into it.
Now, Dad.
This is for you.
Oh, now, Vie, you shouldn't have done that. Now, really.
Well, look. That's just what I needed.
And, Mom, I've got some perfume for you.
- Oh.
- I know you like it.
What a wonderful surprise it all is.
Dad, could you give me that box, there?
Yes. Here you are.
Thanks.
Well, now, this is...
Well, it's...
Oh!
It's really beautiful.
Beautiful.
Only in Paris you could...
Oh, Mom.
You know, Vie, the boys are coming on leave tomorrow.
Oh, that's grand.
I got something for them, too.
Oh, don't worry. They'll just be pleased to see you.
I'll go get the tea.
Oh.
You know, Violette, it will be the first time we've all been together for so long.
I wonder...
Well, we must make the most of it.
Look at that dress.
Doesn't it make you envious?
No. Angry.
Some people forget there's a war on.
- Well, look who's here.
- Hello, Vie.
How lovely.
Come and have a drink.
- Yes, please.
- I don't believe it.
Violette, you look ravishing.
That dress.
If I didn't know you better, I'd say it was straight from Paris.
French from head to toe.
- You don't know Bob, do you?
- No. Bob Mortier.
Violette Szabo.
- Nice to know you.
- How do you do?
- Would you like to dance?
- Well, thank you.
Oh, no, you don't.
- This one's mine.
- Sorry.
Couldn't miss this one.
Denise's friend seems nice.
Bob Mortier, yes, he does.
Remember the last time we were here?
Yes, I do.
A lot's happened since then.
They were playing this tune.
It's been my favorite ever since.
I hope you don't get too fond of it, Tony.
No. Of course not.
All the same, don't shut yourself up in the memory forever.
I know what you mean.
When will the next time be?
There won't be a next time.
- Not for you.
- Why not?
Let's sit down.
- Table all ready, sir.
- Thank you.
Now, listen. You did a magnificent job.
But they won't send you in again.
- Yes, but surely...
- No. It's always more dangerous the second time.
Well, I don't want to go.
- It's not that I...
- Tania? Is that it?
Yes.
I don't think I could bear to leave her anymore.
What about you?
Will you go again?
That's rather beside the point, isn't it?
No. Not really.
If you went, I should worry about you.
Oddly enough, I find that rather a comforting thought.
- Bob's bought you a drink.
- Thanks.
I know it's asking a great deal.
You have every right to say no, and we certainly shan't hold it against you if you do.
But this is a vital operation and we're short of good people.
So I have no option but to ask you.
Well?
Of course I'll go.
Thank you.
I think if I could find a replacement, it'd be better...
No.
But this is going to be a dangerous mission.
Much more dangerous than last time.
You trying to get rid of me?
That doesn't even need an answer.
You want her with you, don't you, Tony?
Yes, but...
Yes, I do.
Good.
Well, then, at this stage, I can't tell you what your mission will be.
In fact, you may not be briefed until the last moment.
But I can tell you this.
You'll be operating in the Limoges area.
You'll be dropped by parachute at Suzac.
And I want you to be prepared to go at the next moon. That's round about the sixth of June.
Any comment?
Well, that's all for the moment.
All right, then, if you'll forgive me, I've got plenty to get on with.
- All right.
- Oh, Vera, can I have a word with you?
Yes. Come on.
Well, what is it you want?
Vera, I've taken your advice and I've made a will.
Oh?
- Would you look after it for me?
- Of course.
Not that there's much to make a fuss about.
There's 100 pounds or so in the bank that Etienne left me, plus my pay. - That's for Tania, of course. - Mmm-hmm.
If anything happened to me, there would be a pension, wouldn't there?
Yes.
Well, then, there are one or two bits and pieces for my mother.
A bracelet Etienne left me, and my wedding and engagement rings.
Well, it's better to have everything straight.
Just put this in my drawer till you come back.
Vera, thanks for everything.
Good luck, Violette.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Why do we insist that you do this?
So that if anything happens to me,
I can't possibly remember the code I've used.
Exactly.
You can't remember it, so they can't get it out of you.
But what happens if you have to destroy this silk?
Well, then, I have to use a poem instead. A poem I've memorized.
The enemy know you have destroyed this code, so they'll do everything in their power to make you tell them your poem.
Always remember, if ever the Germans get your poem, they can transmit to England, and endanger the lives of all the people who come after you.
- Will you leave us now, Miss Shore?
- Yes, sir.
Now, Violette, your poem.
This will only be known by us two.
Yes, I understand.
I have a large selection for you to choose from.
They come in all sizes.
Could I use one that I know, please?
Certainly.
If you remember it well.
Yes, I remember it very well.
Can I hear it?
"The life that I have Is all that I have
"And the life that I have Is yours
"The love that I have Of the life that I have
"Is yours and yours and yours
"A sleep I shall have A rest I shall have
"Yet death will be but a pause
"For the peace of my years In the long green grass
"Will be yours and yours and yours"
You'll never forget that, will you?
No, I'll never forget it.
I'll work something out on that and let you have it.
That's settled then.
In this establishment it's considered bad luck to say good luck, so I'll just say au revoir.
Thank you, darling.
Going away again, Mommy?
Yes, darling.
Just for a little while.
But I'll be back soon.
And then we'll have a party and you can wear your lovely dress.
Take care of yourself, love.
Of course I will.
Oh, when the war's over, I'll start a new career.
- What as?
- Cat burglar.
Climbing walls, opening safes, I'll know it all.
Goodbye, Mom.
I won't worry.
Goodbye.
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me
To me
Bring back
Bring back Bring
What's the time?
Five minutes past midnight.
D-day plus one.
We should be crossing the Normandy coast now.
I wonder how they're doing down there?
Well, we'll soon see.
Okay, chaps, let's get ready.
Are you okay, sir?
Number two.
We're running up to target.
Action stations!
Container!
One!
Two!
Good luck, sir!
Three!
The Germans are coming up from the south.
There's an SS panzer division approaching from Toulouse.
They should be passing through Salon-la-Tour, that's 20 kilometers west of here, tomorrow or the day after.
They will not pass us, you know.
Maybe not. But more Germans will be coming up any day now.
Using every road.
What about the other groups east and west of here?
They will fight?
Random skirmishes won't do any good.
No.
Each group must know exactly what to do and when to do it.
- All right.
- Give each leader his orders
- And he will obey them.
- I shall set up our headquarters here.
We must get word through to the leader of each group immediately.
- I could go. - No.
You must stick by your radio.
Why don't you send me?
There's no one else.
All right.
The group west of here first, then south, then east.
I will present her to the leader in the west and he can pass her on to the next group.
But you're needed here to control this group.
I can be back in three, four hours.
All right.
Make sure that you are.
We can't carry on here without you.
When do we start?
- Tomorrow morning early.
- Magnificent.
I prepare the car right away.
Georges, come on.
Bob, get madame to rustle up some food, will you?
Then we must work out the details for Violette.
Right.
You don't want me to go, do you?
No. I don't.
I can take care of myself.
I'd rather you didn't have to.
You might look after yourself, too.
Salon-la-Tour.
That is where we cross the main road from the south.
Through a village?
Is that a good idea?
I was born there.
They know me.
They will warn us if there are Germans around.
Well, that's all right then.
Look.
That is the house where I was born.
- You see that church tower there? - Mmm-hmm.
I climbed up to the top of that when I was nine years old.
I liked climbing trees when I was a kid.
You know, I...
I think you are too young and too pretty for this kind of work.
You ought to see me before breakfast.
Any Germans come through today?
Germans?
No.
But I have this gun ready if they do.
You keep your gun to shoot rabbits.
Don't look at him.
Finished.
Jacques!
Jacques!
Come on.
- Which is the best way out?
- I know where there's a car.
We must warn the others.
Grenades.
Hey, after them!
We must get through those trees.
But it's across open ground.
It's the only way to the car.
Let's go!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
The car is gone.
Fall back.
You go ahead.
I'll cover you. Make my own way.
No, no. We stay together.
- Quickly.
It is our last chance.
- I can't! I can't!
- We must get over the river.
- I can't!
- It's my ankle!
- I'll carry you.
Don't be a damn fool!
You've got to get back!
I promised.
- Go on.
Get out. - I'm not leaving you here, no.
Run! Run, for God's sake, run!
Come on!
No!
Get your hands off me!
You put up a good fight, mademoiselle.
Cigarette?
Well, we shall see.
Your ankle is getting better?
I hope they're giving you treatment for it.
You Germans are most considerate.
Now, Violette, you see, already we know who you are.
It's only a question of time before we find out everything.
Tell us what we want to know and we'll guarantee your life and the lives of your friends.
You must think I'm a half-wit.
I'm sorry you choose to be difficult.
But I'm used to that.
I am very patient.
Don't you realize the British are only making use of you?
I am British.
I thought you were French, as your husband was.
I should have you shot right away, but I don't want to.
You have a child, haven't you?
What will become of your child if you die?
Come now. Be sensible.
You're young, you're attractive, you're in Paris and the sun is shining.
Would you like some new clothes?
The theater, perhaps?
Supper at Maxim's?
I should be honored...
Violette, others before you have taken the same attitude,
but not for long.
We will try again tomorrow, madame.
When I came to your cell, you behaved very foolishly.
Here in the Avenue Foch the change of scene may help you.
Now, when and where were you dropped?
I don't remember.
Who was your commanding officer?
What contacts did you make in France?
I never knew their names.
Violette, you mustn't take us for fools.
Are you going to go on refusing to answer my questions?
I refuse to tell you anything!
You have only yourself to blame now.
And now, tell me from whom you take your orders.
I'll tell you nothing.
Nothing.
No!
No!
- How long has she been kept awake?
- Seventy-two hours.
So hot.
Very uncomfortable.
I'm ready for her.
Not yet, Violette.
You cannot sleep yet.
Soon you can sleep.
Can you hear me, Violette?
Soon you can sleep.
Sleep.
We know you destroyed your code.
So you must tell us your poem.
All we want from you before we let you sleep, are the words of your poem.
What poem?
Open your eyes, Violette.
And tell me your poem.
And then you can sleep.
What are the words of your poem?
Come now.
Tell me and then you can rest.
"Rest I shall have..."
What kind of poem?
What kind of poem is it, Violette?
You can sleep then.
"Sleep I shall have..."
Is it a love poem?
Not a love poem?
A poem of death?
Last night...
Tell me, Violette.
I wrote a little poem about my love for you.
"A sleep I shall have A rest I shall have
"Yet death will be but a pause
"For the peace of my years
"In the long green grass
"Will be yours and yours and yours "
It's beautiful.
Now it's my turn.
Let me say it.
I want to say it.
Now.
Now you will tell me your poem.
Now.
I hate you.
- Tell me!
- No!
- Tell me! - No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Well, here we are.
At least they didn't separate us.
Oh, it's perishing in here.
Oh, be careful.
Vie?
Lilly?
Denise?
Oh, don't.
Don't cry, Vie.
Everything's going to be all right now.
- We're all together again.
- Yes.
You know that the allies are near Paris?
In a few days you will be free.
Denise.
Oh, it's wonderful to be with you again.
Please don't cry.
Don't cry.
Any idea where they're taking us?
No idea.
I can't stop thinking about when I opened my eyes and saw you two in the cell.
Remember when Lillian fell out of the train up in Scotland.
It took three days to find her.
Poor kid.
She's had an awful time.
What's happening?
What is it?
It's all right.
It's all right.
This is our chance to get away.
I hope you're good at the three-legged race.
- What about Lillian?
- I'll look after her.
All right!
You follow us!
- I think we can get out through that door.
- Let's.
Water!
Water!
Water!
Bring some water!
It's our last chance.
Let's get them some water.
Water!
Bring some water!
Water!
Bring some water!
Here we are, boys!
Here we are!
Water!
You'll all get some.
Now careful there.
That's enough!
That's enough!
- Come on!
- Careful.
Now, you'll all get some.
Now, where are the guards?
Where's the next one!
Come on, now.
Careful, there.
Take it easy.
Tony!
Oh, Tony!
Violette!
- It's empty, get some more. - Take it easy.
Take it easy.
- What are you doing here?
- We're doing your job.
Seeing the prisoners don't escape.
You touch me and I'll report you for leaving us.
I'm sorry I can't get any closer.
Tony, what happened?
- How did they get you?
- I took a chance.
There was a train needed blowing up.
I wasn't quick enough and they nabbed me.
What about you?
- Did Jacques get back? - Oh, yeah.
He got back, thanks to you.
And the German division, did it get through?
No.
They held them up all along the line.
Thank God it turned out all right.
Violette, you were at Frennes, weren't you?
Did you go to the Avenue Foch?
- Oh, Tony, don't spoil it.
- Did you?
Well, once or twice, but they didn't get anything out of me.
- Wasn't bad. Really, it wasn't.
- Oh, God.
- You, too?
- Yeah, doesn't matter now.
We're together again, for a while.
New places. New faces.
That's what you said in the Studio Club.
Did I?
I'm getting tired of new places. Aren't you?
Darling, if we get out of this...
- When we get out.
- All right, when.
Won't be long now.
Just a few weeks.
I shan't ever let you out of my sight again.
I shan't ever want you to.
My daughter used to have such beautiful hair.
Face powder.
Where did you get it?
Whitewash from the wall in the kitchen.
But why?
What's the use?
I don't know.
Just makes me feel better.
You all right, Lilly?
I don't feel too good.
Come on.
Try and sit up.
I'll help you. Come on.
Come on.
Oh, I can't make it today, Vie.
Look. You've got to try.
You've got to.
You mustn't let them see you can't.
Bloch, Rolfe, Szabo, you stay there.
Thank God.
Why are we to stay?
We are fit for work.
- You are coming with me.
- Where to?
Commandant Suhren's orders.
Vie, is this it?
We're all together.
By order of the Fuhrer, the three British agents,
Denise Bloch,
Lillian Rolfe, and Violette Szabo are to be shot.
On the 28th of January, 194 7,
Tania put on the dress which Violette had brought back from Paris.
Now it fitted her.
And she wore it when she was invited with her grandparents to Buckingham Palace.
His Majesty King George VI gave Tania the George Cross and said,
"It is for your mother.
Take great care of it.
"She was a brave woman,
"and you must always be very proud of her. "
- Good day.
- Hello.
- That's a very pretty dress you're wearing.
- It came from Paris.
You've got a medal too, eh?
You'll have to take great care of that.
I'm keeping it for Mommy.
- Hope to see you again soon.
- Yes.
"The life that I have Is all that I have
"And the life that I have Is yours
"The love that I have Of the life that I have
"Is yours and yours and yours
"A sleep I shall have A rest I shall have
"Yet death will be but a pause
"For the peace of my years In the long green grass
"Will be yours and yours
"and yours "
We want Pollitt. Brick Pollitt. We want Pollitt.
Brick Pollitt.
Don't you do that!
I'm warning you, Trixie.
Can't you stop your child from putting her hands in the ice cream?
Couldn't you at least wash your hands before you did that?
How could you do that to a child?
Like this, honey.
Did you see what she did?
I told her to wash her hands first.
One of those no-neck monsters hit me with some ice cream.
Why do you call Gooper's kiddies "no-neck monsters"?
Because your brother's children have got no necks.
Their fat little heads sit on their fat bodies without a bit of connection.
Especially 'cause, if they have no necks you can't wring them. Right, honey?
Did you ever hear so many dog's names tagged on to children?
They've got five monsters and number six coming up.
They've brought the whole bunch here like animals to display at a county fair.
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.
It's obvious what they're up to.
What are they up to, Maggie?
They're up to cutting you out of your father's estate.
Everybody knows Big Daddy's dying of...
I ought to send Sister Woman a bill for a new pair of stockings.
Do we?
Know that Big Daddy is dying of...
Don't you believe it?
You'll know soon enough.
Suppose he is?
There's some things you've got to face.
There's some things in this world you've simply got to face.
Why was Big Daddy in that horrible clinic for six weeks if the examination didn't show anything?
Why did Brother Man bring his whole tribe down here in this sticky heat?
And why so many allusions to you and Rainbow Hill?
It's a place that's famous for treating famous alcoholics and dope fiends.
I'm not famous.
No and you don't take dope. Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate for Rainbow Hill.
That's where Brother Man's going to tell Big Daddy to ship you. Over my dead body!
With you out of the way, Gooper gets hold of the estate signs the checks, and cuts off our credit whenever he wants.
How'd you like that, baby?
You're doing just about everything to aid and abet them in grabbing control, after Big Daddy...
Well, you are.
Quitting work, devoting yourself to drinking!
Breaking your ankle last night on the high school field.
We've got one thing on our side. No, two things.
Are my seams straight?
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.
He just can't stand Brother Man and his wife that fertility monster. She's odious to him.
I can tell.
Just like I can tell he likes me.
That's the second thing we've got on our side.
He likes me.
The way he looks me up and down, and over...
He's still got an eye for girls.
That kind of talk is disgusting.
Anybody ever tell you you were a back-aching Puritan?
I think it's mighty fine how that old fellow, on death's doorstep takes in my shape with what I consider deserved appreciation.
Gooper still cherishes the illusion he took a giant step up the social ladder when he married Mae Flynn of the no-neck Memphis Flynns because she was queen of the Cotton Carnival.
I can just see Gooper falling for Her Majesty sitting on that brass throne, riding that tacky float down Main Street smiling and bowing, and blowing kisses to all the trash on the street.
You know what happened to her?
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso leaned out the window and said:
"Hey, Queenie! "
Sister Mae looked up and smiled and waved and that drunk shot a squirt of tobacco juice right in her face.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?
Like you were just looking.
I wasn't conscious of looking at you.
I was conscious of it.
- Lf you were thinking the same thing...
- Why not?
- Will you please keep your voice down?
I know you better than you think.
I've seen that look before and I know what it used to mean.
- And it still means the same thing now.
- You're not the same woman now, Maggie.
Don't you think I know that?
- Don't you think I know...
- Know what, Maggie?
That I've gone through this horrible transformation.
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.
Are you planning on meeting Big Daddy's plane?
I get so lonely.
Everybody gets that.
Living with somebody you love can be lonelier than living entirely alone when the one you love doesn't love you.
You can't even stand drinking out of the same glass, can you?
Would you like to live alone?
No, I wouldn't.
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?
Most drinking men lose theirs.
Why can't you?
I think you've even got better looking since you went on the bottle.
You were such a wonderful lover.
You'll be late!
You were so exciting to be in love with. Mostly, I guess, because you were...
If I thought you'd never make love to me again I'd find the longest, sharpest knife and stick it straight into my heart.
How long does this have to go on, this punishment?
Haven't I served my term? Can I get a pardon?
Your finishing-school voice sounds like you were running upstairs to say, "Fire! "
Is it any wonder?
You know what I feel like?
I feel all the time like a cat on a hot tin roof.
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.
Cats jump off roofs and land uninjured. Do it. Jump.
Jump where?
Into what?
Take a lover.
I don't deserve that!
I can't see any man but you.
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?
Why can't you get fat or ugly or something, so I can stand it?
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.
I'm more determined than you think.
I'll win all right.
Win what?
What is the victory of a cat on a hot tin roof?
Just staying on it, I guess as long as she can.
Where are the flowers?
Aren't you putting it on a little thick?
Mama, she didn't bring anything for Big Daddy.
Pretty seedy looking flowers for Big Daddy, huh, Gooper?
I picked them myself.
Looks like she picked them off a grave.
Don't talk about graves when we don't know if Big Daddy's going to live or die.
Doc, isn't it great?
Kiss me!
Kiss your grandmother.
You look fine, Big Daddy.
The exploratory operation proved there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy. Nothing at all!
Just a spastic colon. And that's all.
That's the best birthday present of all.
Where's Brick?
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg. - How?
Got drunk again and tried to jump the high hurdles at 3:00 AM.
That poor boy still thinks he's an athlete.
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper. AP got hold of it too.
Yeah, and UP and thanks to your professional legal advice, every other P.
Don't you want to ride with the children?
He's his sassy old self again, all right!
Be quiet, woman!
Hush up!
I'm going to live, Maggie.
I'm going to live.
They had me real scared.
I've wasted so much time.
I've got a million different kinds of feelings left in me.
And I'm going to use them. I'm going to use them all.
Why did you and Brick suddenly drive up from New Orleans?
For your birthday, what else?
I had one last year and the year before. Didn't see you then.
You know how Brick is sometimes.
Maybe he thought he was coming to my funeral instead.
Brick loves you!
But does he love you?
What do you want?
Proof?
If I was married to you three years you'd have the living proof.
You'd have three kids and a fourth in the oven.
Get me out of this. I want to talk to Brick.
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.
"We love you when we're with you "And we love you out of sight
"Big Mama, too"
I've got news, honey! Big news.
Big Daddy's going to live.
That's right, he's a well man.
That's what Big Mama said and Dr. Baugh was right there with them.
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.
They almost dropped dead from shock themselves.
He's all right?
Feeling like 40 and talking like 20.
And we can drive back to New Orleans tonight.
- I'm taking no chances on moving you.
- I won't break.
Or letting them poison Big Daddy's mind against you.
I just want you to get dressed and come to Big Daddy's birthday party.
First thing Big Daddy asked about was you.
Big Daddy!
Now what makes him so big?
His big heart, his big belly or his big money?
The heat has made you cross.
Give me my crutch.
Why don't you put on your silk pyjamas, honey and come on down to the party?
There's a lovely cool breeze.
Give me my crutch, Maggie.
Lean on me, baby.
You've got a nice smell about you.
- Was your bathwater cool?
I know something that would make you cool and fresh.
Alcohol rub. Cologne.
No thanks.
We'd smell alike.
Like a couple of cats in the heat.
It's cool on the lawn.
I am not going down there.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy!
At least give him this present that I remembered to buy for you, for his birthday.
Just write a few words on this card.
You write something.
It's got to be your handwriting. It's your present.
I didn't get him a present.
What's the difference?
If there's no difference, you write the card!
- And have him know you didn't remember?
- I didn't remember!
You don't have to prove it to him!
Just write, "Love, Brick" for heaven's sake!
- You've got to.
- I don't have to do anything!
You forget the conditions I agreed on to stay living with you!
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all!
That's the first time you've raised your voice in a long time.
A crack in the stone wall?
I think that's a fine sign. Mighty fine.
What did you do that for?
To give us a little privacy for a while.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
I don't mind making a fool of myself over you.
I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.
Feel embarrassed!
I can't live on this way.
- You agreed to accept that condition!
- I know I did, but I can't!
Let go.
Let go, Maggie!
We've got the most wonderful news about Big Daddy!
You think there's robbers in the house?
Brick's getting dressed, Big Mama.
He's still getting dressed.
It won't be the first time I've seen Brick not dressed.
Brick, honey!
Sweetheart, how does your leg feel?
Come out of there.
I want to give you the news about Big Daddy.
I told him already.
I just hate locked doors in the house.
I know you do but people need privacy, don't they?
No, ma'am, not in my house.
What did you take this off for?
It looked so sweet on you.
Not sweet enough for Big Daddy's birthday party.
Out!
Mae and Gooper are so touchy about their children.
You hardly even dare suggest there's any room for improvement.
Shoot, Maggie, you just don't like children.
Why that's not true.
I adore them. Well brought up.
Why not have some, then, and bring them up well? - Instead of picking on theirs?
- Big Mama!
Hugh and Betsy have got to go. They're waiting to say goodbye.
I'll be right down.
Tell them to hold their horses.
Where's Brick?
What you said about having children... It's still kind of a secret, but...
Shoot, Maggie! Stop playing so dumb.
Is he still drinking this stuff much?
- He may have had a little highball.
- Don't laugh about it.
Some men stop drinking when they marry. Others start. - He never drank before...
- That's not fair!
Fair or not, I want to ask you a question.
Do you make Brick happy?
- Why don't you ask if he makes me happy? - I know...
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.
When a marriage goes on the rocks the rocks are there, right there!
That's not fair.
Is Brick here?
I thought I'd check his ankle.
Is it giving him much pain?
You know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.
Even when he had that awful back injury in football.
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.
I think they're fixing to sit down at the table.
You forgot to write out the card, honey.
Can I get you something cool?
How's the ankle?
Itches some.
Funny, that's the same leg you tore a muscle in the...
'Bama State.
Twenty-one to... Nothing.
You miss football, don't you?
Hurt much when you put weight on it?
Yeah, you were quite a team, you and Skipper.
What is it, Doc?
You didn't leave that party to come up and discuss my health.
- I've already heard the good news... - It's bad news.
It's what we expected.
It's malignant and it's terminal.
He hasn't a chance.
- But Maggie said, and Big Mama...
I lied to them.
I lied to him, too.
Professional ethics. Gooper?
I told him the truth coming in from the airfield.
He's going to die.
What kind of truth is that?
- Did you like the singing, Big Daddy?
- Pass the black-eyed peas.
Look at Big Daddy eat!
Ain't it something to thank your stars for?
They've been practicing just for you.
Tell them to sit and eat. - Children, come on.
- Over there!
Telegrams! Hundreds of them from every corner of this great state...
Wishing you happy birthday.
Do you want me to read them?
One from the governor and the senator...
It must be getting on to election time, hey, Deacon?
Let's remember, we're all lambs in the same pasture.
Everybody, including Big Daddy, owes thanks to those in high places who...
Gave us nothing!
Every scrap on this table was raised right here on this place, Deacon.
I made a pastureland out of this place when it was nothing but a swamp.
And it was done with the help of God, and not any governor. Amen.
- What are they up to now?
- It's part of the entertainment.
Don't they get any intermission?
That's funny!
He don't mean it, Sister Woman. - He loves children!
- Of course he does!
Will you put some honey on this?
They're all Pollitts, I'm proud to say, every one of them.
I know Big Daddy's just as proud as we are that there's a flesh-and-blood dynasty waiting to take over.
That's no way to talk.
"Take over." When we all know Big Daddy's going to live to be at least 100.
I'll drink to that!
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!
To Big Daddy!
In the name of every person in this county in the name of the church and school board, the board of trustees felicitations on your 65th birthday.
Brick, honey, I brought you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
What's that supposed to mean?
We're leaving.
- We can't.
- I can.
- The party's coming up here to you.
- I'll get one of the boys to drive me.
You just can't walk out on Big Daddy's birthday party!
Don't you care nothing about him?
Get out of my way.
You've got no cause to dislike him.
Do I dislike him?
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.
What's he ever done to you?
Why do you hate him so much?
What's he ever done to you?
Nothing.
What was Dr. Baugh doing up here? What did he...
That's right.
Big Daddy is going to die.
I don't believe that.
Dr. Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.
Wouldn't he, Maggie?
Poor Big Daddy.
I'm fond of him.
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.
I really am, you know.
When he finds out...
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.
That's why you want to go now.
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.
You've got to do this for me, Maggie.
And leave the field to Gooper and his wife? No, sir!
Let's face facts, baby.
You're a drinker. That takes money.
I don't want his money!
Are you ready to settle for ten-cent beer?
That's what Gooper'll dole out to you when they freeze you out.
They've got a plan, baby.
You should've heard them laying it on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute!
Big Mama's already on their side.
You're a drinker and I'm childless.
We've got to beat that plan, we've just got to!
I've been so disgustingly poor all my life.
That's the truth, Brick.
Have you, Maggie?
You don't know what it's like to have to suck up to people you can't stand, just because they have money.
You don't know what it's like never having any clothes.
That dress I married you in was a hand-me-down from a snotty, rich cousin I hated.
You can be young without money. But you can't be old without it.
Where did I fail you?
Where did I make my mistake?
Make that your last drink until after the party please, honey.
I think I made my mistake when I tried to tell you about Skipper.
That's my fatal error.
- I never should...
- Shut up about Skipper! I mean it! Shut up!
The laws of silence won't work about that!
Not about Skipper and us.
It's like locking the door on a fire to forget the house is burning.
But not looking at a fire doesn't put it out.
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper...
I don't want to hear about it!
Why won't you face the truth, just once about Skipper, about me, about yourself?
Are you bringing that party up here or not?
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this and I don't care if it's in front of them.
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?
Are you still blaming me for Skipper's death?
I could kill you with this crutch.
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?
Skipper and I had a friendship. Why won't you let it alone?
- It's got to be told!
- I don't want to hear it!
It's got to be told and you never let me tell it.
I love you and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!
Skipper was no good!
Maybe I'm no good.
Nobody's good.
But Skipper is dead!
And I'm alive!
Maggie the cat is alive!
I'm alive!
Why are you afraid of the truth?
Truth?
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you to knock before you open a door.
Otherwise, people might think you're lacking in good breeding.
What's Uncle Brick doing on the floor?
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie but I failed and I fell.
Little girl, would you hand me my crutch, please?
What were you jumping high hurdles for?
Because I used to, and people like to do what they used to do after they've stopped being able to do it.
And that's your answer.
Now go away.
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!
You're just jealous because you can't have babies.
Mae and Gooper gloat over us being childless even in front of their little no-neck monsters.
I went to a doctor in Memphis.
A gynaecologist.
He says there's no reason why we can't have a child whenever we want.
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.
But how in hell do you imagine you're going to have a child by a man who cannot stand you?
That, boy of mine is a problem I'll just have to work out.
Here comes that party, here we come!
The preacher almost cried when I told him I got a stained-glass memorial window.
Who gave you that window, Deacon?
Clyde Fletcher's widow, a generous woman of fine character.
What someone should give our church is a cooling system. Yes, sir.
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots and the tetanus shots diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots, polio shots.
Gooper, what have all the kiddies been shot for?
Everything but stealing chickens.
Congratulations, Big Daddy, on your birthday.
- Bull! - Guess what memorial Gus's family gave?
- A new house and basketball court... - Deacon!
What's all this talk about memorial stained-glass windows?
Figuring on somebody kicking off around here?
How about some nice music to start the party off with?
Turn that damn thing off!
Where's my Brick?
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.
How does your leg feel, honey?
Your hand was made for holding something better!
Put that liquor down. - He is putting it down, all right!
How about a birthday kiss, honey?
Hey, everybody, you know the first time Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.
It's a fact.
Ain't that so, honey?
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper and Big Daddy said, "That's my kid, ain't it?"
It was kind of funny. I'd never had a beau till I met your father.
He said, "I want that kid. "I need him.
"He ain't going to have nobody else's name but mine.
Let's get the preacher.
"That's what marriage is for.
Family."
Children were mighty important to Big Daddy, even then.
Ida, will you stop that yammering?
That's just his manner of talking. He don't mean it.
I've been his one and only lover, haven't I, sweetheart?
Ida, will you keep quiet?
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow
"And so is Big Mama, too
- Ida, what the hell's the matter with you?
I'm so happy.
I've just got to cry or something.
Big Daddy's 100 percent healthy!
Aren't you going to give Big Daddy his birthday present?
- You can open up your birthday present. - You open it. I want to talk to Brick.
Brick, come over here.
- It's a cashmere robe!
- You sound surprised.
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny!
What's so funny about it?
All my family ever had was family.
Quiet!
- You bought it yourself last Saturday. - I said quiet!
The salesgirl that sold it to you waited on me and she told me about it.
I'm not butting in on more talk about memorial stained-glass windows, am I?
Not at all. What do you get out of this charity work, anyway?
I love humanity.
That's my reward.
And if humanity returns your love, you might get elected councilman or mayor, hey, Deacon?
Don't start picking on Deacon.
- Good night, Deacon.
That's exactly what I was about to say.
I better go before it starts raining.
Good night, everybody. Bless each and every one in this place.
They tell me you were indulging in some athletics last night.
- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?
What were you doing on the high school athletic field at 3:00 in the morning?
I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.
Because you were drunk!
Sober, I would not have tried to jump even the low ones.
It's time to blow out the candles!
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt on his 65th birthday.
- To the biggest cotton planter...
- I told you, quit this bull!
I won't let you talk this way, not even on your birthday.
I'll talk like I want to on my birthday, or any other rotten day.
Anybody don't like it, they know what they can do about it.
- I know you don't mean that. - You don't know nothing, never did.
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.
I've put up with a lot of bull around here because I thought I was dying.
That's when you started taking over.
Your loud voice and busybody butting in here and there and everywhere. Sashaying around here, making a big noise like a boss.
I'm the only boss around here.
I built this place with no help from you.
And I'll run this place till the day I die.
Is that perfectly clear to you?
I ain't going to die.
Ain't nothing wrong with me but a spastic colon!
Made spastic, I reckon, by all the lies and liars I've had to put up with around here.
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with these 40 years I've lived with you.
Now blow out them candles.
Go on.
Blow out them candles on that stupid cake.
In all these years you never believed I loved you.
And I did.
I did so much.
I did love you.
I even loved your hate and your hardness.
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- Lf he should die before...
Son!
I was calling Brick.
I was just delivering him to you.
- What did you do that for?
- Do what?
Wipe off her kiss?
Your woman's got a better shape on her than Gooper's got on his.
- Is that the only difference you've noticed?
- Difference in shape is pretty important.
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?
They don't look peaceful.
How's that?
They're a couple of cats sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres of land.
They're both squaring off, determined to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise for them babies.
I ain't letting go for a long time yet, if they're waiting for that.
You just sit tight and let them scratch each other's eyes out.
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.
Five head of them already and more coming.
6-0. She'll probably drop a litter next time.
- Are you stuck out there?
- I was just passing by.
You were just sneaking and spying.
Do I have to lock all the doors around here to have a private conversation?
- Why hurt those that really love you?
- Bull!
I'm going to move you and Gooper out of that room.
It's none of your business what goes on in here between Brick and Maggie.
I hate sneaking and spying! It makes me puke!
They listen, do they?
Yeah, they listen.
They run and tell Big Mama everything they hear.
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!
- What are you doing now?
- Freshening up my drink.
- You know you've a real liquor problem? - Yes, sir.
- Is that why you quit sports announcing? - I guess so.
Yes, sir, that's it.
Don't guess!
So you quit.
- Some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?
Do you think a shot of that whisky would injure my spastic condition?
No, sir.
It might do it some good.
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!
That's the way to feel.
I can breathe.
All my life I've been like a doubled-up fist pounding and smashing and driving!
But now I'm going to take things easy with them.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
What's that, sir?
Pleasure!
I'll tell you, I still have a feeling for women, and I'm 65.
- That's mighty remarkable.
Admirable.
It's not only remarkable and admirable, it's downright satisfying.
- I'm going to have me a ball. - A ball?
I'm going to pick me a choice woman and I'm going to smother her in minks and choke her with diamonds.
I'm going to be happy!
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches? - Yes, sir.
- Why?
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?
- A click in my head.
- Did you say, "click"? Yes, sir.
That click in my head that makes me feel peaceful.
Boy, sometimes you worry me.
Like a switch clicking off in my head.
Turns the hot light off and the cool one on.
All of a sudden, there's peace.
You're a real alcoholic!
That is the truth.
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.
- I'm waiting for that click and I don't get it unless I'm alone! I'm not talking. When it's quiet!
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.
This talk is like all the others. It gets nowhere and it's painful!
- Let it be painful.
- I can crawl and hop if I have to.
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out this family and be drinking on skid row.
Yeah, that will come too.
Now that I'm straightened out, I'm going to straighten you out.
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!
- Where are you going?
- To get another bottle.
No, you're not, you drunken whelp!
- Why are you shouting?
I can't stand it! - Get out of here!
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?
You had better know why you drink or give it up!
Give me my crutch.
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.
Good!
At least you're not too numb with liquor to feel pain.
- Why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.
- Tell me first.
- No, give me a drink first.
- First you've got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.
What are you disgusted with?
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!
Who's been lying to you?
Maggie?
No, not one lie or one person. The whole thing.
- You got a headache? - No, I'm trying...
Trying to concentrate, but you can't because your brain is soaked with liquor.
Mendacity!
What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her!
Get out of there!
Mendacity!
Look at the lies I've got to put up with. Pretenses, hypocrisy!
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.
Church!
It bores me, but I go.
All those swindling lodges, social clubs, and money-grabbing auxiliaries that's got me on their number one sucker list.
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?
You've got to. There's nothing to live with but mendacity.
Yes, sir, you can live with this.
That's not living.
- That's dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.
Then why not kill yourself?
Because I like to drink.
I can't talk to you!
Do you expect me to turn over 28,000 acres of the richest land this side of the Nile to a drunk fool? No, sir.
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize worthless behavior?
Give it to Gooper and Mae.
I can't stand Gooper and Mae and those five screaming monkeys.
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!
To this day, I ain't made no will. Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.
I can wait and see if you pull yourself together or not. That's right.
- I'm not kidding. - No, sir, I know you're not kidding.
You don't care?
No, sir, I don't care.
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.
I'm going home tonight. Now!
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?
Let's not leave it like this. Like all them other talks we've had.
We always seem to talk around things.
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.
- Now we've got to talk straight.
- It's too late for talk.
Why?
What are you disgusted about?
Because you can't play football anymore?
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!
What? Sit in a glass box watching games that I can't play?
Describing what I can't do while others do it?
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can stand it? You'll get that back for me?
I think you're passing the buck.
Do you know many drinking men? I've known a good number.
Could any of them they tell you why they drank?
You're passing the buck?
You're passing the buck to things like disgust and mendacity.
If you've got to use that kind of language it's 90 proof bull and I ain't buying any!
You started drinking with your friend Skipper's death.
Ain't that the truth?
What are you suggesting?
Nothing. But...
But what?
Say your mind. Say it!
- Why are you so excited? - Go ahead, say it!
Why are you shouting like that?
Skipper and I were friends, understand?
Gooper said that Skipper was...
Skipper is the only thing that I've got left to believe in! And you drag it through the gutter! - Just a minute!
- You make it shameful and filthy!
Give me your hand.
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!
Didn't you ever look up to anybody? Anybody at all in your whole life?
Didn't you ever believe in anything, anybody?
No, sir, I guess you didn't.
Nothing and nobody except Big Daddy himself.
You and Skipper played football together. Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?
I could depend on him. - On the football field!
- Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!
- Are you sure of that? - Yes.
Bull!
Why did your big strong man fall apart?
Why did Skipper crack up?
You're asking for it, we're going to have that talk.
That straight, true talk.
It's too late to stop now.
Can you say it without a drink?
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.
What else do you need?
Skipper?
- He was a crutch for you too, wasn't he?
- Yes, sir.
I could lean on him, in school and out of it.
How did Maggie take this great and true friendship?
Ask her.
I'm asking you.
If you want to know why Skipper cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.
What did she do?
Chase him out of the window of that Chicago hotel?
Did that little bitty girl shove your big hero out all by herself?
Why?
What went on between Skipper and Maggie?
Ask her.
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you!
What was going on between you and Skipper?
Well, you see, Big Daddy...
Well?
You wanted to talk truth upstairs. Go ahead!
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!
Skipper didn't like me.
Why didn't Skipper like you?
- You know he was against our marriage.
- Why?
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what?
Freedom to run from town to town. Planes, trains, always running! - Football practice, dirty stories...
- Nobody forced you to come along with us!
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon in the locker room with the boys.
Since when did a man's smell ever injure your sensitive feelings?
Football, baby!
The idea of football smelled.
Especially the notions of a professional team.
He didn't need any team of his own.
He could've gotten a spot on any pro team in the country.
You organized your own team on account of Skipper.
- You're a liar! - He wasn't good enough on his own.
Professional football is a business not a social club!
You mean the business of making money?
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!
Not from the first day to the last.
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers. He lapped them up.
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!
Because they shut you out and you hated that.
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.
By the man I worshiped.
That's why I hated Skipper.
You hated him so much you got him drunk and went to bed with him.
Is that true?
You don't think I ravished a football hero?
Skipper was drunk.
So are you most of the time.
I don't seem to make out so well with you.
Are you saying nothing happened between you and Skipper?
- You know what happened.
- I don't know!
I wasn't there. I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.
- I was in the hospital... - Skipper played.
He played all right!
His first professional game without Brick.
Tell Big Daddy what happened.
Go on, tell him.
You're a sports announcer.
Give us a running account of the all-American bust.
Tell him how many times Skipper fumbled and stumbled and fell apart.
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.
And it was all over:
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.
Bad breaks.
An off day. No, baby.
Without you, Skipper was nothing.
Outside: Big, tough, confident.
Inside:
Pure jelly!
You saw the game on TV. You saw what happened.
But I didn't see what happened in Skipper's hotel room. That little episode was not on TV.
Tell Big Daddy why you were in Skipper's room.
He was sick. Sick with drink. He wouldn't come out.
He'd busted some furniture and the hotel manager said to stop him before he called the police.
So I went to his room.
I scratched on his door and begged him to let me in.
He was half crazy.
Violent and screaming one minute weak and crying the next.
And all the time, scared stiff about you.
So I said to him maybe it was time we forgot about football.
Maybe he ought to get a job and let me and Brick alone.
I thought he'd hit me.
He walked toward me with a funny sort of smile on his face.
Then he did the strangest thing.
He kissed me.
That was the first time he'd ever touched me.
And then I knew what I was going to do.
I'd get rid of Skipper.
I'd show Brick that their deep, true friendship was a big lie.
I'd prove it by showing that Skipper would make love to his best friend's wife.
He didn't need any coaxing. He was more than willing.
He even seemed to have the same idea.
You're just trying to whitewash it.
I'm not!
I was trying to win back my husband. It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything. Even that.
But at the last second I got panicky.
Supposing I lost you instead?
Supposing you'd hate me instead of Skipper?
So I ran. Nothing happened!
I've tried to tell him a hundred times but he won't let me.
Nothing happened!
Hallelujah, St. Maggie.
I wanted to get rid of Skipper. But not if it meant losing you.
He blames me for Skipper's death.
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.
Skipper won out anyway.
I didn't get rid of him at all.
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?
I lost you anyway.
- You didn't talk to him again before he...
- But Brick did.
- How do you know?
- Skipper told me. - When?
When they put his broken body in the ambulance.
I rode with him to the hospital.
He kept saying, "Why did Brick hang up on me?"
Why, Brick?
- Where are you going?
- Home.
- You can't drive. You're drunk.
- Not yet, Big Daddy. Not yet.
Now, give me that bottle.
What are you running away from?
Why did you hang up on Skipper when he called you?
Answer me!
What did he say? Was it about him and Maggie?
- He said they'd made love.
- And you believed him?
Yes.
Then why haven't you thrown her out?
Something's missing here.
Why did Skipper kill himself?
Because somebody let him down.
I let him down.
When he called that night I couldn't make sense out of...
But there was one thing that was sure.
Skipper was scared.
Scared about what happened that day on the football field. That I'd blame him.
Scared that I'd walk out on him.
Skipper afraid!
I couldn't believe that.
I mean, inside he was real deep-down scared and he broke like a rotten stick.
He started crying:
"I need you." He kept babbling, "Help me."
Me help him?
How does one drowning man help another drowning man?
So you hung up on him.
And then that phone started to ring again.
It rang and it rang and it wouldn't stop ringing.
And I lay in that hospital bed, unable to move or run from that sound.
It kept ringing louder and louder.
And the sound of that was like Skipper screaming for help.
And I couldn't pick it up.
So that's when he killed himself?
Because I let him down.
So that disgust with mendacity is really disgust with myself.
When I hear that click I don't hear the sound of that phone ringing anymore.
And I can stop thinking.
I'm ashamed! That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.
But the truth is always there in the morning, isn't it?
And it's here right now.
You're just feeling sorry for yourself. That's all it is. Self-pity!
You didn't kill Skipper.
He killed himself.
You, Skipper and lots like you, living in a kid's world playing games, touchdowns, no worries, no responsibilities.
Life ain't no damn football game. Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid pretending you hear cheers when there ain't any.
Dreaming and drinking your life away.
Heroes in the real world live 24 hours a day, not just two hours in a game.
Mendacity!
You won't live with mendacity, but you're an expert at it.
The truth is pain and sweat paying bills and making love to a woman that you don't love anymore.
The truth is dreams that don't come true and nobody prints your name in the paper till you die.
The truth is you never growed up.
- Grown-ups don't hang up on friends. - Get away. And they don't hang up on their wives.
Now that's the truth that you can't face.
Sure, somebody else's truth!
- You're running again.
- Yeah, I am.
Running from lies, like birthday congratulations and many happy returns of the day when there won't be any, and...
Please, let me go home.
- What did you say?
- I don't remember.
- There won't be any happy returns?
- Forget it.
Let me go home. Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.
Who said I was going to leave the place or anything?
I'll outlive you.
I'll bury you.
- I'll buy your coffin.
- That's right.
Many happy returns.
They were lying weren't they, son about that report from the clinic?
This pain that keeps grabbing at me...
It's death ain't it?
Answer me!
The truth!
You said it yourself. Mendacity is a system we live in.
Look at us, Maggie.
The great Pollitt Enterprises stuck in the...
I hurt him, Maggie.
I hurt him really bad.
What's the matter?
What's happened? - Why is Big Daddy...
- We've got to talk to you.
- Get Dr. Baugh! - Where is he?
I don't know, just find him.
I wouldn't go down to him right now.
What are you doing?
I'm coming down.
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.
If that pain gets too bad this is morphine and a syringe.
The instructions are written out.
It's no use pretending anymore.
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.
Make it easy on yourself.
You'd better take off those wet clothes.
Why?
You afraid I might catch cold and die?
Why can't I go down to him?
His stomach's upset, Ida.
All he needs is a peppermint.
It's time we had that talk, Doc.
- It'll be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.
It's time we all had our talk.
What talk are you talking about?
- What were they fighting about?
- We didn't discuss it.
What's he doing in the cellar all alone?
Why can't Big Mama see him?
He's got the stomach upset. It's made him irritable.
When couples have been together as long as me and Big Daddy they get irritable with each other from too much devotion.
Of course that's so.
He loves his family.
He loves them around, but it strains his nerves.
He wasn't himself. I could tell he was all worked-up.
It's the party and the excitement.
He's probably just a little worn out, that's all.
Did you notice how he ate?
He ate like a P-I-G hog.
I hope he doesn't regret it.
He helped himself twice to hopping John.
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.
That man put away enough to stuff a field hand.
I hope he doesn't have to pay for it later on.
There ain't nothing wrong with Big Daddy but nerves.
Ain't that so?
He's as sound as a dollar. And now he knows he is.
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he he wasn't doomed to what he thought he was doomed to.
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.
We won't allow anything to happen to him.
I don't need any doctor.
He's something to say about Big Daddy.
I want Brick.
He'll be down directly.
Sticky rain always makes me sick.
Give me something to wash this tablet down with.
What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.
Big Mama needs you.
They'll tell her without me.
I just can't stand the way that Mae and Gooper are... What?
Trying to grab this place for themselves? Let them have it all.
If you want to fight for a piece of his carcass you go ahead, but you'll do it without me.
I deserved that. But not this time. This time you're wrong.
What I can't stand is... It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.
I know what it's like to lose somebody you love.
Careful, your claws are showing.
Close that door.
Don't close that door.
Let a little air circulate.
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy hearing this discussion.
What discussion of what?
There won't be a word said in Big Daddy's house that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?
Where do you think? Gone to pieces, that's where!
Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?
- He don't need no cure. - Of course not.
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then. I don't trust a man who don't drink.
Good for you!
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand while we talk.
What are you all surrounding me for?
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.
Are you all crazy?
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.
- You calm yourself, Sister Woman!
How can I calm myself with everyone staring at me as if blood was on my face?
What's all this about?
Big Mama wants to know the truth about the clinic report.
Truth!
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.
The truth is as dirty as lies!
Is there something I don't know, Doc?
I want to know!
- Somebody must be lying.
- Sit down, Mama, please.
I want to know about my husband.
He had the most thorough examination at the Oppenheim Clinic.
One of the best clinics in the country.
The best in the country, bar none.
They were 99.9 percent sure before they even started. Right, Doc?
- Not now! - The test was positive!
Shut up.
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.
Hopeless?
Why didn't they cut it out of him?
- It's gone past the knife.
- He's dying, Big Mama.
You get away from me, Mae!
I want Brick.
Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?
- I'm your son, too. - Gooper's your firstborn.
- He'll be in pain. - Gooper and I think...
Do you want to see him suffer? Then he's got to be started on morphine.
Nobody's going to give my husband morphine.
Why don't you give her a while to adjust to the idea?
Instead of the needle, haven't you got a pill to make the pain disappear?
Sometimes I wish I had a pill to make people disappear.
Does Brick know?
You know, honey we was never a very happy family.
There wasn't much joy in this house.
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just...
You know how some homes are happy.
I thought, coming home from the clinic today, "Now we'll be happy here."
You and Brick will live with us and have your children here.
And we'll help each other be happy.
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?
Margaret, honey you've got to help Brick.
Make him pull himself together.
- He's going to take hold of things.
- What things?
The place.
Big Mama, you've had a shock.
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough... He'd never put this place in irresponsible hands!
He ain't putting this place in anybody's hands.
My husband is not going to die!
I want you to get that in your heads. Both of you.
- We're hoping too.
- We intend to pray for him.
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to...
Gooper is your firstborn!
He's always had to carry a bigger load of the responsibilities than Brick.
Brick never carried a thing in his life but a football or a highball.
Will you let me talk, please?
A 28,000 acre plantation is a mighty big thing to run.
Almost single-handed.
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?
Mama, let's be fair.
Ever since Big Daddy's health started failing Gooper's worked like a fool to keep this place up.
Gooper won't admit it. He never thought of it as a duty.
The point is I won't see this place ruined by a drunken ex-football hero.
Shut up about my husband!
You shut up!
He has no right to slander...
I can discuss my brother with my family members which don't include you!
Or was it the Rose Bowl he made his run in?
It was the punch bowl, honey.
The cut-glass punch bowl.
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.
I have never seen such malice toward a brother.
What about his malice toward Gooper?
He can't even stand being in the same room with me.
- Where's my father?
- He's in the cellar. And he's alone.
- It's a deliberate campaign to ruin Brick. - He don't need help.
For the most disgusting, sordid reasons on earth.
Avarice.
Avarice and greed!
Don't cry.
That takes the cake!
Who are the tears for?
Brick?
Big Daddy?
Or for yourself?
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?
You know why she's got no kids?
Ask her big, beautiful husband.
You just won't let me do this the nice way, will you?
You always said I never loved Big Daddy. How would you know?
Did he ever let anyone love him?
It was always Brick. From the day he was born he was always partial to Brick.
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.
He said get married. I did. He said have kids.
I did.
He said live in Memphis. I did.
Whatever he said to do, I did.
I don't give a damn whether Big Daddy likes me or did or never did or will or will never.
I've appealed for common decency and fair play.
I intend to protect my interests.
I'm not a corporation lawyer for nothing.
Go get my briefcase out of our bedroom.
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.
- Give me your hand.
- I don't want your hand!
It's my pain. That makes it my business.
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?
I came to apologize.
What for, telling me the truth?
- There must a dozen reasons. - Save them.
I hate apologies. Especially for the truth.
Whatever you did, don't apologize. Just don't do it again.
Start by getting me a cigar out of that coat.
It's wet from rain.
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.
Modern science!
Get me that that robe.
- There's a bottle in that desk.
- I don't want a drink.
I do. I want a drink.
I've got a million clicks in my guts.
You know about clicks, don't you?
So you bought me a birthday present, huh?
No, Maggie bought it.
- She's got good taste that girl.
- In some things, yes but not in men.
Nice soft material. This is my soft birthday.
Not my gold or silver. This is my soft birthday.
Here's to my last birthday.
Aren't you drinking to that?
You know what I'm going to do before I die?
I'm going to open up all these boxes.
Bought most of it when I took your mother to Europe on that tour.
Never had such a lousy time in my life.
That Europe is nothing but a great big auction.
Bunch of old worn-out places. It's just a big fire sale.
Big Mama went wild in it.
She just bought and bought.
She was lucky I'm a rich man. Yes, it sure is lucky.
Got any idea what I'm worth?
Ask Gooper.
He knows to the penny unless I miss my guess.
Close on $10 million in cash and blue-chip stocks besides some 28,000 acres of the richest land this side of the Valley Nile.
That is pretty rich to be.
There's one thing you can't buy in a Europe fire sale or any other market on earth.
That's your life.
You can't buy back your life when it's finished.
No, sir. Nobody can do that.
Feeling sorry for me or you?
For you, Papa.
That's good, because you're going to miss me.
Why did you let Ma buy all this stuff?
The human animal is a beast that eventually has to die.
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.
The reason why he buys everything he can, is because of a crazy hope that one of the things he buys will be life everlasting which it never can be.
I've suddenly noticed you don't call me Big Daddy anymore.
If you needed a Big Daddy, why didn't you come to me?
If you wanted someone to lean on, why Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.
You should've come to your kinfolk. Those who love you.
You don't know what love means. To you it's another four-letter word.
You've got a short memory.
- What did you want that I didn't buy?
- You can't buy love!
You bought $1 million worth of junk! Does it love you?
Who do you think I bought it for?
It's yours, the place, the money!
I don't want things!
- Get out of my way.
Waste!
Worthless!
Please don't cry.
That's funny.
I never saw you cry before. Did you ever cry as a kid?
Can't you understand? I never wanted your place or money.
I don't want to own anything!
All I wanted was a father, not a boss!
I wanted you to love me.
I did and I do.
Not me and not Gooper, and not even Mama.
That's a lie.
I loved her. I gave her...
Things, Papa, you gave her things.
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.
Some jewelry. You gave her things, not love.
I gave her an empire.
I've seen you out there on your empire with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.
What are faces? You don't build an empire by remembering faces.
Next week, I'll start building that textile plant.
I'll not only grow my own cotton, I'll weave it and market it.
I'll tell you in a year or two from now...
The men who build empires die, and empires die too.
No, it won't.
That's why I've got you and Gooper.
Look at Gooper. Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?
Look at me. You were right.
I am a 30-year-old kid. And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?
There's got to be some purpose in life, some meaning.
Look at me, for the sake of God, before it's too late!
For once, look at me as I really am.
Look at me!
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.
On my own in the open market, I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.
- All of you blame me for everything, huh?
We've known each other all my life and we're strangers.
You own 28,000 acres. You own $10 million. You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.
- In my own way...
- No, sir.
You don't even like people.
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?
I want a part of me to keep living. I won't have it end with the grave.
This is what my father left me.
This lousy old suitcase!
On the inside was nothing but his uniform from the Spanish-American War.
This was his legacy to me. Nothing at all!
And I built this place from nothing.
And that's all he left you?
Yeah, he was a hobo.
He worked once in a while as a field hand. I'd tag along.
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt, waiting for him.
Outside of hunger first thing I could remember is shame.
I was ashamed of that miserable, old tramp.
I was riding boxcars when I was nine, something you never had to do.
And you'll never have to bury me like I did him.
I buried him in a meadow, alongside a railroad track.
We were running to catch a freight and his heart gave out.
That lousy old tramp died laughing.
Laughing at what?
Himself, I guess.
A hobo tramp not a nickel in his jeans.
Or maybe he was laughing because he was happy.
Happy at having you with him. He took you everywhere and he kept you with him.
I don't want to talk about that.
Yeah, I loved him.
I reckon I never loved anything as much as that lousy old tramp.
And you say he left you nothing but a suitcase with a uniform in it from the Spanish-American War?
And some memories.
And love.
Did I tell you all them stories about my old man?
About fifty times.
It's a plan to protect the Delta's biggest estate from irresponsibility.
Where is it?
What the doctor left to make his pain easier.
Brick's down there with him.
He'll help Big Daddy.
How?
By running the 100-yard dash?
Maybe he'll cheer him up by kicking some field goals.
One more crack, Queenie and I will not only spit in your eye but I will punch it black and blue.
- I'm not listening to any more... - Mae was only saying...
I know what she said, and I know exactly what she meant.
The only world that Brick knows...
It's not a world he made.
- Why won't you take it?
- It'll kill the pain, that's all.
- It'll kill the senses, too.
When you've got pain at least you know you're alive.
It's easing somewhat now.
When you've got pain it's better to judge yourself, a lot of things.
I'm not going to stupefy myself with that stuff.
I want to think clear.
I want to see everything and feel everything.
Then I won't mind going.
I've got the guts to die.
What I want to know is, have you got the guts to live?
I don't know.
We can try.
We could start by helping each other up these stairs.
At least read them.
Put those papers away before I tear them up.
I don't want to know what's in them.
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language. I'm his wife, not his widow. His wife!
- What I've got here... - He said it's just a plan.
Plan basis. What I'll say to your plan is...
What is it Big Daddy says when he's disgusted?
He says "bull" when he's disgusted.
I say "bull" like Big Daddy.
Then stop talking like your father's dead and me along with him.
What about her? She wants her share, too.
As far as Brick is concerned nobody's going to take nothing.
Not till Big Daddy lets go and maybe just possibly, not even then! No, Mama, not even then.
Looks like the wind took some liberties with this place.
- Storm cross over the river? - Gone to Arkansas.
Rain do some good, Cap'n?
Some good, I reckon.
Can I come in?
Has the storm done any damage?
Which storm are you talking about?
The one outside or that hullabaloo going on in here?
Heard some mighty loud talking.
What's the powwow about?
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.
What's in them important-looking documents you've got there?
Nothing. Nothing much of anything at all.
Then what are you and Sister Woman scurrying and scrounging around for?
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.
What's that smell in this room?
Didn't you notice the powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity?
Ain't nothing more powerful than the odor of mendacity.
- Didn't you notice it, Gooper? - What, sir?
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell of mendacity in this room?
I don't even know what that is.
You can smell it.
It smells like death.
What's the matter with that woman?
What's-your-name, what's wrong?
She just had a slight dizzy spell.
You'd better watch that.
A stroke's a bad way to go.
Look, he's wearing Brick's birthday present.
I haven't given you my present yet but I will now.
I have an announcement.
An announcement of life beginning.
A child is coming sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.
I have Brick's child in my body.
And that is my present to you.
Did you ever in your born days hear such a bald-faced lie?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Yes, indeed, this girl has life in her body.
And that's no lie.
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!
I'm going out to look this place over before I give it up.
The place and the people on it.
You want to come with me?
What were you two talking about down there?
Us.
Me, too?
You ripped your own brother apart.
Do you believe that, Gooper?
A family crisis brings out the best and the worst in every member.
That's the truth.
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.
- She made it up. - I said shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us.
She's not kidding you.
How can she have a child by you, when you won't even...
We occupy the next room and the walls aren't soundproof.
We hear the nightly pleading and the nightly refusals!
Not everybody makes as much noise about love as you do.
I never thought you would stoop to her level!
You heard what Big Daddy said, "That girl's got life in her body."
- That's a lie!
No, truth is something desperate, and Maggie's got it.
Believe me, it is desperate, and she has got it.
Why don't you say something, honey?
All right, honey.
Shut up!
Come on up here.
That girl's got life in her, all right.
Thank you for keeping still. For backing me up in my lie.
We are through with lies and liars in this house.
Lock the door.
Senor Reece is coming.
- Beg your pardon?
- He's here, in Chicago.
Mr. Reece, did you say?
- He'll be here soon.
- He wants his usual accommodations?
- Just like always.
- Tell him everything will be ready.
Right.
Tucker, Hamblin.
Mr. Reece is in town.
He'll want the south wing of the 2nd floor.
- We already have people in that wing.
- They'll have to be moved.
Tucker, the kitchen and liquor pantry will need extra waiters.
We'll put Mr. Reece in 200A as usual.
Mr. Fowler, the Vidals are in that suite.
You're well acquainted with Miss Vidal.
Move them elsewhere.
You just don't move people like the Vidals.
Bring Mr. Reece's trunks up.
Everything is to be pressed, evening clothes first.
You know I cannot see you here.
My aunt is inside, and my father is due.
I know, I have to speak to your father.
- My father?
- Yes.
It's a hotel situation. Something about the rooms.
May I wait inside? Please?
Yes, of course.
Last night, I thought it was the moonlight.
I was wrong.
- About what?
- You're just as pretty in here.
- Frank, please!
- You said she doesn't speak English.
She can see the expression in your eyes. Anybody can understand that.
Did you understand the poem I sent?
Poem? What poem?
- Father, this is...
- Yes, I know Mr. Harris.
There's been a mistake.
It seems these rooms were reserved.
However, I have another suite of rooms that is much larger.
- There's a breeze...
- We're comfortable here.
Yes, sir.
But I'm only acting on orders from the manager.
- Isn't there anything I can do...?
- Yes, there is.
You can tell me if you wrote this poetry to my daughter.
I'm in love with your daughter.
I'd like to marry her.
I could never approve.
Our way of life is too different.
I don't intend to remain a hotel clerk.
I came to get in the cattle business, to make a fortune on the trail.
In Maria's world, money is no recommendation.
Maria, we are going home.
Let's start packing.
And now, be good enough to have my bill sent up.
Goodbye, young man.
And don't think that love can find a way.
I know all the ways.
Here he comes!
- Pleased to have you again.
- Pleasure to be here.
- I want my men taken care of.
- We'll take you to your rooms.
- Bring a large herd?
- Worst trail ever.
Storms, droughts and Indians fed on my beef.
Send up whiskey and cold chickens.
I'm sick of beef.
Right away.
- You have enough food for the party?
- All taken care of.
And hot baths. We've been on the trail for two months!
First one to the bath, boys!
- Senor Vidal, what are you doing here? - A visit.
I'm returning to Mexico.
We'll be there in spring.
Any cattle worth buying?
I can sell you all you want.
Hold on to them.
We'll do business when I get there.
Thank you.
Maria.
Maria!
We lost 87 head on the stock train between here and Wichita.
They got shaken off their feet, kicked to death.
You should have seen that roadbed.
It had rail gaps in it 8 inches wide.
Might've been safer to trail through.
Lose a few pounds, save a few cow.
- How's the opera season this year?
- Beg your pardon?
Opera, man.
Opera!
- I don't know, I guess it's all right. - You guess?
You call yourself civilized, but know nothing about the opera?
- I keep my mind on business.
- Let's get to business.
- I have 2476 head.
Quotations?
- Two and a half cents per pound.
- Could go down by morning.
- Could go up.
I got 80 percent grassers 10 percent half-fats, 10 percent canners.
- Little low on canners. - Little high.
You get the best of it.
I figure two and three-quarters for the lot.
We figured two and a half.
Two and three-quarters, or I feed them till they go to three.
Decide. I want a bath.
New York market's closed.
We should wait.
- He's right.
We should think it over.
- You do that, Mac.
Paco, go keep an eye on those cows.
We're holding on to them for a while.
Chicago has all the coal in the world!
You can't get enough hot water!
Where's that boy?
Boy, when I take a bath, I want hot water!
When I mean hot water, I mean hot water!
Hot water...
Can't take a bath...
Tom you ready to talk business now?
Boot's grown to my foot.
I think I'm beefsteaked.
- You were kind of quiet out there.
- Let the boys do the bickering.
Makes it easier to close the deal.
Two and a half cents for everything if you deal right now.
You know how I feel about cows.
I'd just as soon own them and be poor as sell them and be rich.
You can't wait for them to fatten, you have to start on a new drive.
You need beef so bad your mouth's watering.
You can have the whole lot for 48,000.
You got a deal.
Now we can quit lying and get to business.
Pull up a chair and open the whiskey. Have a drink.
- Boy, we need more whiskey!
- Yes, sir!
Tom, when will you get smart stop beating yourself out on that trail?
Hook up with me here.
We'll build the biggest meatpacking business in town.
I could never learn to play partners.
I just think about it, I get itchy all over.
Get some nice clothes on, we're going to the opera.
- Opera?
- Yeah.
- What about the party?
- That's after.
Pour it in, son.
Sounds like the party's already started.
Close that door out there!
I'm freezing my whiffletree!
Come in.
I took the liberty of bringing these to you myself.
- Set them down and open one for me.
- Yes, sir.
I understand you're going back down to Mexico?
If the good Lord spares me.
And if I ever get another drink.
Mr. Reece...
- To the brim, that's what a cup's for.
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Reece I'm a farmer.
You had me fooled.
No, what I mean is, I was raised on a farm.
I know a lot about animals, and I'm interested in the cattle business.
That's why I came here.
I'd like to go to work for you, sir.
Cockroach.
What makes you think you'd like to go trail-herding?
All my life I've dreamt of going into the cattle business. Getting on the trail.
I hate Chicago, I'd like to live in the open.
- You know what I mean.
- I know.
Lying under the stars, the boys singing around the campfire.
And your faithful old horse grazing at the grass by your side.
- You do much riding? - Me?
I bet I could ride all day and night.
Is that a fact?
- I bet you like horses.
- I sure do.
I thought so.
You're an idiot. A dreamy idiot, and that's the worst kind.
Know what it's really like?
Dust storms and cloudbursts.
Only a fool wants that.
And that hogwash about horses.
The loyalty and intelligence of the horse.
A horse's brain is the size of a walnut.
They're mean, treacherous and stupid.
Not enough sense to move away from a hot fire.
No sensible man loves a horse.
He tolerates the filthy animal because riding's better than walking.
Pour me a little more whiskey.
In spite of having a brain the size of a bean, no horse ever...
- And did you ever taste horse?
- No.
Hasn't got a gamy or beef flavour.
Just tastes like horse.
As for cattle, those miserable, slab-sided fleabags...
- Pour yourself a drink. - No.
No matter what you say, I want that job.
- Try another outfit.
- I have.
A tenderfoot's too much responsibility.
- It wouldn't be your responsibility.
Can you put the studs in that dress shirt?
I don't wanna be late for the opera.
I thought I saw a spider up there.
Isn't that beautiful? It is.
Mike, isn't that the most beautiful thing you ever heard?
One thing about opera: It sounds just as bad no matter who sings it.
Hey, boss!
This is the best party you ever threw!
- It was good last year.
- She wasn't here last year.
And we weren't expecting that extra money.
Thank my friend here. He overpaid for the herd!
Yes, you did!
Well, well, well.
Leaving a little early, aren't you, Peggy?
- Tom, the poker game's all set up.
- Let's go to work!
You ladies amuse yourselves for a while. Don't go away, though.
Come on, Mike!
I hate to keep bleeding you, Tom, but I have to raise it 100.
It's up to you, Reece.
- I'll call you.
- Pass.
Pass.
Three kings.
Beats me.
- $50 on the filly.
- You got a bet.
Joe, you take your hands off me!
Just not my night, I guess.
Why don't you wait over there for me?
It's your deal.
Here's the hand, right here.
Want to buy some chips, Tom?
No, not right now.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Sure.
I'd like to pay my bill.
I'm leaving in the morning.
I better pay while I still have some money.
Divide what's left amongst the help.
We thought you'd stay for a week.
So did I, but I don't usually lose quite so fast.
- See you next time.
- Without cash, how can you buy cattle?
My credit's still good.
Mr. Reece could you use some money?
What if I could?
You might take me along as a partner if I was willing to invest some money.
- How much you got?
- $3800.
- I beg your pardon?
- $3800.
My father gave it to me when he sold the farm.
- Where is it?
- Here in the safe.
- Well, get it out, boy.
- Yes, sir.
There they are, gents.
All spades.
Where did you get money this late?
An honest man has friends everywhere, but you wouldn't know that.
I ante.
Mr. Harris would like to talk to you.
- Harris?
- He's the desk clerk.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Deal me out of this one.
You want to see me?
I wrote out an agreement about our partnership, a contract.
Contract?
What for?
So we'd both know what the deal was.
See, it's...
I've never signed a contract or welshed on a deal in my life.
You think I'd sell my reputation for $3800?
I didn't think that.
I just, it's...
I tell you what you do.
Go home and get some sleep.
We're pulling out in the morning.
Fine. I hope you didn't think I didn't trust you.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Oh, by the way my name's Tom.
Thanks.
Mine's Frank.
Thanks.
Stampede! Come on, let's go!
Pick up your gear.
The train leaves in 10 minutes.
- All right, Mendoza.
Wake up. - What?
- We're heading south.
- So soon?
What happened?
You lose all the money so quick?
I won it back. Most of it, at least.
- I'm getting out while I'm ahead.
- I hear you've got a partner.
- Who told you that?
- Hi, Tom!
He did.
He woke me up this morning. He's excited about going on the trail.
He's got a girl. She lives down in Guadalupe.
- How are you feeling today, Tom?
- I've got a headache.
- Look, boy...
- My name's Frank.
I borrowed some money last night, and I'm paying you back.
With interest.
I don't want the money back.
We're partners.
I was drinking. I made a mistake.
I never had a partner, and never will.
Suppose you take this and go back to the hotel.
- I quit my job at the hotel.
- Why'd you do a fool thing like that?
Because you've got a girl in Mexico?
You made a deal with me.
I paid for a share of your outfit, and that's all I want.
Don't talk like that.
I've ridden for 20 years. Sweat over every trail.
You think you bought a percentage of that?
- I bought what you were selling.
- I got four arrow holes, you buy that?
I believed you when you said you never welshed on a deal.
- I'm giving your money back.
- That's not our deal.
- He's right.
- How do you know?
If he wasn't right, you would have killed him by now.
You called me Tom.
I'd prefer you called me Reece.
Anytime you want your money back, you ask for it. Anytime.
- How about this guy, Reece?
- He's all right if you are.
Does he pay off at the end of a run?
You ask him for what's coming in the middle of a river crossing he'll pay off in dry bills.
There! - Dirty old dog!
- Curtis, you should've been with us!
You look scarier than last I saw you.
We been in Chicago. We got barrel fever.
Reece only gave us one night, but what a night!
- Get my telegram?
- The men and grub are ready.
The horses are outside of town.
- Hire the extra hand?
- Sure.
Here's Doc Bender. Used to be marshal at Wichita.
Hi.
You got quite a reputation. I wanted a cowhand, not a gunslinger.
I'm a cowhand now.
I like cows better than I like people.
All right.
Let's get going.
Paco, get him something to wear. He can't go on the trail like this.
Thought I'd buy clothes if you'll wait.
Nobody's waiting.
You stay with us, you have to keep moving.
See if there's a spare rig for him in the chuck wagon.
Come on, Harris.
Beats me how women can go for you cowboys.
Women like the smell of a horse on a man. It makes them giggle.
The smell of a horse on me never did me no good.
Just makes them move away.
Maybe you're associating with the wrong horses.
Good-looking boots.
Move them out.
- How's the water supply been?
- Not bad, boss.
Pick your horses!
Pick the horses that haven't been ridden since we left!
Start breaking the ones that haven't been broke.
- Do these go on any special way?
- Yeah, like an apron.
Shake your tail, or there won't be anything left fit to ride.
Bring that horse back!
If you can't ride that horse, you'll have to carry him.
Set another place, here comes Harris!
Next time catch him.
Here he comes again!
- What is that?
- Salt water and whiskey.
Best way to toughen it up.
Feel any better?
Yeah, it burns instead of just aching.
That's what it's supposed to do. It fries your hide.
You look like you're half-dead. I can't get enough sleep.
Don't you get a day off?
No Sunday on the trail.
You have to learn to sleep in your saddle.
Yep.
That's it.
Harris?
- I told you to ride night herd.
- I made a deal. Capper's doing it.
Do your own job and forget about making deals.
If you can't pull your weight, say so. You can have your money back.
I told you I didn't want it back.
Then get out there and go to work.
This little filly up in Chicago says to me:
"Honey, stay here with me.
I'll take care of you the rest of your life."
- Why didn't you do it?
- Who wants to live in Chicago?
Turn him loose around a woman for 24 hours he's got enough flies to last the season.
Joe, tell the boys about the time you ate them Indians.
I ain't ate but one Indian my whole life.
Even then it was just a haunch.
Being a town marshal I figured that was a pretty good job.
What made you give it up?
Same old story. You know.
Man gets a reputation with a gun he's just got to do too much killing.
Last time in Wichita two of them jumped me in the dark and I had to shoot them.
Later, I found they were just young, drunken saddle bums looking for excitement.
That's when I quit my job as marshal.
That's no way to live.
I can't understand, something smells good.
To hear you trail hands talk, you'd think you were being poisoned.
You've got a visitor!
Snakes.
I found one curled up in my boot yesterday.
No, wait!
I ask you. Did you ever see a more comfortable picture in your life?
Come to think of it, I don't believe I ever did.
Harris, want to see a prairie eel?
Shoot him, Slim.
- Shoot him, Slim!
- Ain't my snake!
Cut it out.
- Here, Charlie, it's a girl. - I like them with bigger hips.
I said to cut it out.
It got me.
It got me.
Go get him.
I got his legs.
I got him here!
- Let go of me!
- Wait a minute!
You trying to pump that poison to your heart?
Leave me alone.
Must have got him in the vein.
He's bleeding enough.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Someday there'll be fences up and down this trail.
I'd rather fight Indians than cut my way through fences.
Joe would rather be fighting Indians.
- Makes him hungry thinking about it.
- Cut it out.
I was near starving to death.
Besides, I didn't even know that Indian.
Anyway, I threw away everything but one haunch.
- Which one did you keep?
- The left one, of course.
The right one is the working haunch.
How long do you figure to Guadalupe?
Eight or nine days, something like that.
I've been dreaming every night about them Mexican gals.
I wouldn't take $400 for what I dreamed last night.
You've been talking in your sleep too.
I wish you'd dream something else.
You think of something better to dream about I'll dream about it.
Looks to me like he's dead, boss.
Slim, you, Capper, Harris. Get some shovels.
Make it deep, so the coyotes can't get at him.
Keep away from there.
You killed him, aren't you satisfied?
You have to steal his boots?
- I killed him?
- Put it down or I'll bust you open!
You're not busting anybody.
Someone did something stupid. No reason to make more trouble.
You don't like what goes on here, that's too bad.
Nobody said you were gonna like it.
Now get out there and start digging.
Anybody know the right words?
All right.
When something like this happens people ask how come it happened.
I mean... Was it his fault?
Was it somebody else's fault?
It isn't for us to say. We don't know all the answers.
All we know is a man's dead, and that's that.
It wouldn't have made a difference.
If it hadn't been a snake, it would've been a steer.
Or a Comanche.
His horse might even have stumbled in a prairie dog hole some dark night.
He was a good man with cattle.
Always did the best he knew how.
I hope somebody can say the same over me.
All right, fill her up.
After seven weeks, it will be good to have chicken again.
- What are the decorations for?
- Some kind of fiesta.
Ask him where the Vidal ranch is.
He says when we leave this town, there ain't nothing else but.
We're going to Vidal's to pick up a herd.
I'm going too.
- What for?
- I'm your partner.
You mean you've got personal business?
I forgot about Miss Vidal.
You men drink now, we'll be branding tomorrow.
Any man that starts a fight will have to finish it with me.
- Welcome.
- We're glad to be here.
This is Paco Mendoza.
Frank Harris.
Yes, I know Senor Harris.
He writes poetry.
- He does?
- I used to.
Come in, please.
- May I present Senor Reece...
- How do you do?
...Senor Harris Senor Mendoza.
My sister Dona Luisa, my daughter Maria and her husband, Manuel Arriega.
Would you gentlemen care for a drink?
If you don't mind I thought we might look over the beef.
As you wish.
Manuel, please bring our horses.
This way, sir.
How long will this take?
We'll stay till the job is finished.
I hope you're satisfied.
- Looks good.
- Best there is.
By the way, we're having a fiesta.
There will be much amusement.
I hope you all will come.
After the branding.
The boys could stand a little amusement.
- You did not get my letter?
- I left Chicago the day after you.
I wrote to explain the whole thing.
I never expected to see you again.
- Why didn't you wait?
- Please, you must leave now.
- I'm not permitted to see you alone.
- Why didn't you wait?
I should explain, Manuel that Senor Harris is a friend from Chicago.
And I should explain to you, Maria, that you are my wife.
You will of course not wish to see her again, alone.
I believe Senor Reece is waiting for you.
That's all I could grab hold of, honey.
You can't win all of them.
The final event, ladies and gentlemen is the game of the cattle.
- Mendoza, what's this about?
- It's a crazy game.
Stay out of it.
That bull in there is a real killer. See?
The horns are painted red.
Man has to put a ring over his horn.
Some do it, some get killed.
That's not for me.
Manuel Arriega challenges anyone who wishes to compete against him.
Perhaps one of the Americanos would like to take a chance?
I wouldn't go in there for a whiskey and a woman to pour it.
Now for the American caballero!
I'll bet 10 on the American.
- Who wants to make a real bet?
- $100!
You got it!
Anybody wants an advance, go ahead and make your bets.
Harris, come here.
I'm playing this one myself.
- Why didn't you say so before?
- I didn't have money up before.
- Trying to show off?
- Protecting my bet, that's all.
Getting killed for money is one thing doing it to impress a girl is stupid.
Paco.
Take him away, I don't want him.
- You crazy?
- I don't want to get him cut up.
The next contestant is Don Thomas Reece.
Open it up, son.
I could not let you go without seeing you once more.
Without talking with you, alone.
You know my father was troubled about us in Chicago.
As soon as we returned here, Manuel and I were betrothed.
Here, children have nothing to say about these things.
Do you love him?
I am not a child anymore.
I cannot have everything... Tell me.
Do you love him?
- What's the matter?
- I need a drink.
Better stay out of there. Charlie's inside asking for trouble.
He'll get himself carved up.
- Doesn't he need help?
- You want to help him? You help him.
Get knifed in the belly, you won't be able to hold your guts in.
- I'm not gonna run out on him.
- You're a good boy.
Joe, wake up!
Charlie's in trouble!
- He's gonna get his throat cut!
- That's his problem.
- You gotta help.
- I told you to stay out of it.
- He's grabbing someone's gal.
- No reason for us to get hurt.
If a man picks a fight, he's gotta fight it.
The fun's in the picking, not the fighting.
Doc, you gotta help.
Charlie's in bad trouble.
Four guys in the saloon are gonna jump him.
- Four of them?
- Yeah.
I don't like the odds.
- What do we do? Let him get killed?
- All right.
We heard about Charlie.
Now shut up and go to bed.
- What'll you do about him?
- Go to bed, same as you.
What happens to him?
Man's old enough to get in trouble, he can get himself out of it.
I got cows to worry about.
A man's life means nothing to you?
All you care about is your herd of cattle!
You're the most miserable bunch of men I ever saw in my whole life.
Not one shred of decency in the lot of you.
I thought I'd be living with some men on the trail.
Not just a pack of animals.
I'm sorry we don't measure up to your way of thinking.
But get one thing straight:
Nobody cares what you thought it would be.
You wanted to play cowboy. Didn't realize it's rough.
I'm gonna help Charlie.
Is anyone going with me or am I alone?
Nobody's leaving.
You start trouble, we'll lose men.
The whole town will be on our hands.
Why don't you forget about what's really bothering you?
Starting a fight won't help you get that girl back.
That doesn't work, either.
I'm going back and there's nothing you can do about it.
- The fire!
- I see it.
- You had enough?
- No!
Enough!
- You don't even fight like a man.
- Fighting's no game with me.
I'll remember that.
Next time I'll use a crowbar.
You just do that.
Peggy I want some hot coffee.
All right.
How's the arm, Charlie?
It's my drinking arm, not my loving arm.
He got cut up a little, is all. Not enough to teach him a lesson.
Harris will make a good cowboy.
You think I've been rough on him.
That's what my father said to my mother.
He always treated me too hard, my father.
But he liked me very much.
Capper!
Just leave it for the coyotes.
- He can't keep up with the herd.
- See if you can get a cow to feed him.
I don't want it on my saddle!
- It's worth $20 in Chicago.
And you?
- Take him back to the herd.
Get on, cow, cow!
You're learning.
That a cow means more than a man?
I play your rules, but that doesn't mean I like them.
I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
What?
That girl back there.
Those things can be pretty rough.
But a deal like that never works out in the long run.
You got too much going against it.
So you just mark it off, and figure it's a part of growing up.
Nobody asked me, but I think you're better off.
You do, huh?
Maybe it's not my business...
That's right.
It's none of your business.
Curtis. Look, Indians.
Been following us for three hours, hoping to pick up some strays.
We'll bed the herd here for the night and make camp up there.
Paco!
- How many men are with the herd?
- Two, just like always.
Better put a couple more on tonight.
- Where's Harris?
- He went after strays. 40 of them.
There's Indians.
Why send him?
I didn't.
He went by himself.
I want two more men down there tonight.
- Harris back yet?
Hey, Reece.
Indians.
Comanches.
Hold your fire till they get in range.
- Must make you feel hungry, Joe.
- Shut up, will you?
They're not even heading this way.
They're after something else.
Harris must be down there. They'll hit him and take the strays.
How come they passed us by?
They got a better deal down there.
Kill one man and get 40 head of cattle.
We wouldn't stand a chance.
He picked a fine time to play cowboy.
While they're busy with him, we can get away.
He's a goner.
Paco.
We'll stampede the herd into that arroyo and drive the Indians off.
We'll never get the cattle back in this country.
I, too, like this boy. But we have to think about the herd.
It's my herd, isn't it?
It's all right. It's all right.
You won't be able to ride.
You scattered our herd all over!
Why are you bellyaching?
I could've fought them off one by one!
I wish I'd let you try.
Reece's knee is shot up.
I'm taking over the herd.
Mendoza's taking over.
I'm the partner, not him.
Doc and Capper, take Reece to the wagon.
We work straight through till we get that herd rounded up.
- I ought to tear him apart.
- You'll tear yourself apart.
He's young.
What can go wrong?
I'll keep an eye on things.
- We'll cut him some splints.
- Come on.
Let's keep moving, men.
We can't rest now.
Come on, it's nearly dawn.
Mount up.
Get off my bedroll, Curtis.
I've worked day and night.
I ain't moving.
Move or I'll teach you manners.
You do and you'll learn more than you teach.
Cut it out!
Now we'll see what you had for breakfast!
Get back up the hill.
You better slack off. The boys are getting pretty mean.
We rounded up all the herd we could find.
- How many head did we lose?
- Just over 200.
- That's a lot.
- Yeah, it's too bad.
- It's too bad for you.
- Why?
We found all my cows.
Seems it was yours that ran off.
That's interesting.
How did you separate yours from mine?
It was easy.
I used a crowbar.
Okay! Move them out!
- How far is it into town?
- Just over the hill.
I'd like to draw my time when we get in town. Stay a while.
I thought you weren't going back.
I figure if I wasn't marshal, I could live here peaceful.
There's a fellow in town, Sam Hacker.
A no-good cuss.
But we were good friends.
- I miss the old son of a gun.
- You're getting old.
It ain't that.
A man has to have something besides a gun and saddle.
You just can't make it by yourself.
I wish you luck.
I hope it all turns out peaceful.
Maybe I'll see you next time.
- Railcar's loaded.
- Twelve cars!
Keep them moving.
We've gotta go!
Did you hear about Doc Bender?
He's dead.
- He killed himself.
- You're crazy.
He was in the saloon drinking with a friend of his, Sam Hacker.
Hacker got real mean and pulled a gun on Doc.
Doc had to kill him.
- What happened to Doc?
- He hung himself.
In the livery stable.
Nobody knows why.
- Thirteen cars loaded.
- Right, 13.
Doc won the fight.
Why'd he want to kill himself?
Nothing we can do about it.
Mendoza!
Get to work.
We got cattle to load.
We need that next string of cars right now!
- You just don't give a damn, do you?
- You're a fine one to talk.
You buried a man once. "In the long run, it doesn't make a difference."
Maybe watching you made me change my mind.
If you had anything inside worth saving I'd beat you down, but you'll never learn.
You haven't gotten tough, you've just gotten miserable.
Boss, we're gonna lose some cattle.
We got three down steers in one car and two in the next.
Harris, give Capper a hand.
- There's four down now, see them?
- I see them.
Are you crazy?
Those cows will rip your belly open.
- I wouldn't go in there.
- They're not your cows.
I have to laugh.
You made him tough.
Now you don't like what you made.
Know what I think?
He'd have been all right if not for that girl.
Come on, play.
Well, he learned how to handle cows maybe he'll learn how to handle women.
Ain't my business but that crazy Harris is prying cattle off the floor.
- What did you leave him there for?
- I ain't the ramrod here, he is.
- Where are you going?
- I'm tired of burying people.
I suppose this is one of mine, huh?
It all depends on if we can save it.
Come on, let's go!
Miserable slab-sided fleabags!
Listen about those cattle we lost. Maybe I made a mistake. - Yeah?
- I don't think they were all yours.
I'd say about fifty-fifty.
That sounds like a fair split.
Come on, let's go.
- Good to see you again.
- Good to be here.
- Meet my partner, Frank Harris.
- Hello, Fowler, how are you?
Take care of him. He used to be in the hotel business.
- I have your rooms all ready.
- Fine.
How long will you stay?
One week, maybe.
Two weeks, if it's all right...
- Make it three.
- Ring for anything you want.
- Plenty of hot water and whiskey.
- Make that double.
Pour it in, son.
- Tom.
- Frank.

Sheriff muller speaking.
No, governor.
Nobody dead.
Yes.
Sideswiped.
Yes. Only 2 escaped.
Yes, governor.
I know what my first obligation is.
We're still waiting on the dogs.
Yes, governor.
Any minute now.
I got to call in to warden comisky.
Yes, governor.
I'm quite sure you will.
Hello, Max.
Dave.
Am I the first?
You're the only one I called.
Anything new?
Who was that on the phone?
Governor.
Oh? Anything I can print?
Sure.
He says he's going to get to the bottom of this.
Well, that's nice of him.
It's an election year.
Well, it's election year for you, too, Max.
Try warden comisky again.
We need that laundry for the dogs.
Ok.
And call marysville.
See if they located that dog man.
Here you are, sheriff.
Some coffee.
Thanks.
Thanks.
It's hot.
Come on, boys, let's go.
Pile it out, let's get the lead out.
That's right. Pile it out, will you, boys?
Let's go. We have no time to lose.
Here we go.
Now what the devil?
Well, here we are, Max.
Who sent for you?
I called them.
What am I going to do with them?
Deputize them.
We're short-handed.
I only have 6 men...
Turn that radio off, please?
If those roadblocks don't pick those boys up, we may have to fine-comb a lot of ground before we're gonna flush 'em.
Well, watch how you play with those guns.
They're not toys.
You kiddin', Max, after all the hunting we've done together?
It's just like hunting' rabbits.
These are men.
Same thing.
Sure, men and rabbits, same thing.
It's not the same thing.
Well, we just wanted to give you a hand, Max.
Help out.
Want to be helpful, Lou?
Sure, Max.
Good. Get rid of this.
All right, boys.
Chow down the line, huh?
Let's eat it up. Off we go.
When you gonna quit being a stubborn dutchman?
They really want to help, and they can come in handy.
I GUESS SO.
All right.
Now, what about those 2 men who escaped?
SHERIFF!
I GOT THE WARDEN ON THE PHONE.
Fine.
Uh, you can get the captain to show you the transfer records.
Get everything you want from them.
COME IN 21 attention, plan "a" cars.
Cover all ramps to wall street west station men at all Bridges.
Attention all cars. Attention all cars.
Be on lookout for 19
Noah Cullen, negro.
Assault and battery, intent to kill, 10 to 20. Parole refused, solitary, work camp.
John Jackson, Caucasian.
Armed robbery--
Caucasian?
Caucasian, 5 to 10, attacked guard, additional 5, parole refused.
Hey, Max, how come they chained a white man to a black?
The warden's got a sense of humor.
What'd he say just now?
He said not to worry about catching them.
They'll probably kill each other before they go 5 miles.
Hey, you, Max!
Stop aggravating those dogs!
What's he so excited about?
For heaven's sake, you shouldn't be eating in front of the dogs.
That isn't very nice.
After all they've got feelings, too, you know.
Now, shut up in there!
Calm down, solly.
We're not hurting their feelings.
I'm sorry, sheriff, I shouldn't have yelled at you, but look, my dogs are very high-strung.
Now, will you please...
I'm sorry.
What are those?
These beauties in here, these are dobermans.
You just don't know nothing about dogs, do you?
Not that kind.
Well now, you see, my bloodhounds here, they won't even touch a hamburger, but these here beauties... Well, when my bloodhounds track them down, these boys will take care of them all right.
We ain't gonna need 'em.
We're dealing with dangerous criminals, sheriff.
No telling what we'll run into.
How dangerous can they be, chained together?
Excuse me, solly.
Look, muller, come here.
You're new to this kind of operation.
If your views are humanitarian, you better start thinking about the farmers here as well as your own deputies.
Will you let me do my own thinking, captain.
It's your show, sheriff.
But I say the dogs go along.
I've got my own men to think of.
All right, but kept on leash.
Hear that, solly?
You keep those dogs on leash.
Don't matter to me.
Don't let them go unless I tell you.
All right.
All right, solly, get busy.
You'll find the old clothes in the back of the squad car.
All right, I'll have to make a pretty big circle, though.
Your men been tramping all around this here place. Yeah.
Helmick! Get everybody up to the Jeep!
I'm going to buy me a pair of buckskin shoes, with a brand new suit, and a silk shirt, and I'll be Charlie potatoes.
Charlie potatoes coming down the street with a Panama hat and a good-looking gal.
Come on, boy. You got a free arm.
Come on, boy.
Hit it! Come on, boy.
Hit it now! "Boy," eh?
Yeah, hit it.
Yassah, boss.
No more "yassah, boss."
I'll catch a boat to rio and never be found.
No more "yassah, boss."
I'll never be found.
No more "yassah, boss."
It won't break.
Need a chisel and a hammer.
Come on, let's go.
Go where?
Pineville. Let's head for pineville.
Pineville's south.
I don't go south.
I used to know a girl in pineville. If she's there we'll get this broke.
And then what?
I'm a strange colored man in a white south town-- how long before they pick me up?
Get off my back!
I ain't married to you.
What do I care?
COME ON!
You're married to me, Joker, and here's the ring.
But I ain't goin' south on no honeymoon.
We're goin' north.
Through the swamp?
WE GO ROUND IT.
Used to work a turpentine mill 60 miles north of here.
There's a train come to pick up the turpentine every day, come out of the west end of the swamp heading' cross the line to the paintmakers up north in Ohio.
Now, we try for that train.
How long you been in jail?
8 years.
Then how do you know the train's still running?
I DON'T KNOW.
You don't know.
You're asking me to go 60 miles, and you don't even know?
What're you inviting me on?
A long walk off a short pier?
And I'm going to come up with a wet head.
Nothin' doin'.
Now, come on.
Come on, damn you.
Come on!
You're Charlie potatoes, huh?
Yeah.
You're going to dance down the street with a gal on one arm and this on the other?
You're gonna grab a boat to rio pulling your own anchor?
We can get this broke.
What are you going to do?
Bite it through with your teeth?
Maybe your head's hard enough.
Time's going to come, Joker. The time's going to come.
But if you want it to be right here, right now, that's ok with me.
You've got the advantage, boy.
You're tough to see if the light ain't good.
But you can hear me, Joker, so listen good.
Either we go north together, or together we go them 10 miles right back to dead street.
You're right, boy.
Man, you're right.
The time is going to come.
It's sure going to come.
All right, now north is up that way.
All right, men.
We're ready to move out.
The sheriff's in charge, and I'm second in command.
You take your orders from us.
At the command to proceed, you'll deploy into 2 groups in a skirmish- line formation, pivoting around the headquarters group, which consists of the sheriff and myself.
You, douse that radio.
One more thing-- this may take a couple of days, maybe more.
So all check your gear, your rations, ponchos.
You new deputies, you check with the troopers.
Keep your lines dressed.
Don't fall behind.
Just one minute.
Anything you'd like to add, sheriff?
Negative.
Deploy.
Let's move out.
Boy, I can't...
I almost swallowed half that river.
Thanks.
What for?
For pulling me out.
Man, I didn't pull you out.
I kept you from pulling me in.
What is it?
You didn't approve of dogs.
What are you talking about?
I got nothing against dogs.
They're man's best friend, aren't they?
What are you looking for? Lipstick?
All right, solly.
Get going.
Wait a minute, sheriff.
I can't run my dogs anymore today.
They need a rest.
We got another good hour of daylight left.
Never mind. Our men need a rest, too.
Ok?
Ok, solly.
It was that last waltz that did it.
You're giving those cons a pretty good head start.
They have to rest, too, you know.
You don't look so good yourself.
Now.
Got him.
Listen to them.
What are they? Night birds, mostly.
Bugs.
I wish they'd shut up.
Thanks.
I keep listening for the dogs.
It's too soon.
They must have started by now.
How fast do you think they can go?
Ain't no road.
They have to come on foot same as us.
Animals in there?
Some.
What kind?
All kinds.
Like what?
Like 'gators and wild pig, black bear.
How come they don't make any noise?
They're animals, they're either being hunted or hunting.
Either way, they don't make no noise.
I go with that.
Listen to them.
There must be a million of them, and not one understands what the other one is saying.
They're just bugs.
Bugs or people, nobody understands anybody.
Them animals, they're smarter.
You keep quiet, and you hunt for yourself.
I go with that.
What was that?
Weasel.
Hoot owl must have got him.
I thought you said they didn't make any noise.
Only when they're dying, Joker.
That's a great way to live.
You keep quiet all your life, and the only time you open your mouth is when you're dying.
Thanks.
Ah, why don't you cut it out?
Hmm? You keep saying "thanks." I hate that word, "thanks."
Don't mean nothin'.
"Don't mean nothin'," eh?
You try making a living with that word, you'll find out.
I used to park cars in Nash's.
Fella'd give me his car, and I'd say, "thank you, sir."
Here I was doin' him a favor, but I had to say, "thank you, sir."
And the louder I said it, the bigger the tip.
That figures.
That don't figure nothing.
You got to be Charlie potatoes, the man with the money.
Then you don't have to bow down to nobody.
That's the way I'm gonna live.
Even when he didn't give a tip, I still had to say "thank you."
That word got like it was sticking needles in me every time I said it.
That can happen with a word.
You know what I mean, boy?
Yeah, and I got a needle sticking in me right now.
Look, Joker, don't call me "boy."
Why, you're just too sensitive, man.
I'm too nothin'.
That's right, you're too "nothin" is right.
But I got a little advice for you, man, because I like you, man.
You gotta take things as they are.
You can't keep fighting them, unless you wanna be unhappy.
I see you got a lot to learn, boy.
Like you livin' in that fancy hotel.
Yeah, like me living in that fancy hotel.
You think they're gonna let me in that fancy hotel, too?
Oh, sure, they're gonna let you in that hotel.
Through the back door, if you got a pail and a mop.
And you through the front door, just long enough to collect your tip.
What's eatin' you?
Just because I called you a ni-- yeah.
Well, that's what you are, ain't it?
It's like calling a spade a spade.
I'm a honky.
I don't try to argue out of it.
You can call me a bohunk.
You ever hear tell of a bohunk in a woodpile, Joker?
You ever hear tell of "catch a bohunk by the toe"?
Depends on how you mean it.
How'd you mean it?
Like I said it, don't crowd me. I didn't make up no names.
No, you breathe it in when you're born and you spit it out from then on.
That name sure bugs you, don't it?
Well, that's the way it is, and you're stuck with it.
'Cause I didn't make any rules.
No, but you sure live by them.
Everybody lives by 'em.
Everybody's stuck with what he is, even them swamp animals.
Even that weasel.
You calling me a weasel?
No, I'm calling you a white man.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Come on, let's get out of here.
Do you think he saw us?
I don't know.
What is this?
Where are we?
I think it's some kind of Clay pit.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Why don't you let go of the chain?
You telling me what to do?
Come on, let's try it again.
Let me try it.
Let me try it on your shoulders.
Come on.
Give me a little slack.
I can't.
Don't let go now.
Hold on. Hold on.
I got it! I got it!
Don't slip!
Hold on!
What are you doing?
Looking at this hand.
What for?
It looks infected.
Well, what're you gonna do about it?
Needs fixing. Don't do me any favors.
I ain't doin' you no favors, Joker.
That feels nice and cool.
It's a poultice.
What do you want me to say?
Want me to say "thanks"?
All right, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks!
That word sure bugs you, don't it?
Well, I been sayin' it all my life.
When I was a kid, I didn't have no shoes.
My old man'd take me to church and I'd sit there with the rest of the kids, and I'd say, "thank you, lord.
Thank you." Well, they didn't have no shoes either, Joker.
All god's children got shoes.
Come on.
Muller speaking.
Kill the roadblocks.
They've headed north.
No, there's chance of them circling back.
THEY'RE ALREADY ACROSS THE McHenry.
Well, trail's still pretty fresh.
We should have them in a day or 2.
Max, I got something I want to say to you.
It's important.
Come on, baby, just get down here. Thanks, we'll make it all right.
Call my wife, will you?
And tell her everything's ok.
Fine. Listen to what I gotta to say, Max.
It's important.
No matter what, I'm not letting my dogs cross that water out there.
You hear?
Fine.
It better be fine. I ain't lettin' nobody make me ruin my dogs.
I sure hope you treat your grandmother the way you treat those dogs.
That's funny.
Th-th-that--you're a real big, funny man.
It wasn't meant to be.
Uh-huh. I tell you something, I think more of these here dogs than I do about any 2 old, stupid, stinking convicts.
Don't you forget that, huh?
Good, good.
Come on, baby, come on.
Max, you don't care if I use your phone, do you?
Got anything?
Well, the way I got it figured, we'll Ford it h--
We'll Ford it here and regroup across the river, then backtrack and pick up the trail.
Fine.
You know, that detour'll cost us 2 hours.
Can't be helped.
I think it could.
Why don't we call cumberland while we still got the Jeep. For what? To ask for a tank and a couple of armored divisions?
You realize those men have a 12-hour start, and we're about to lose 2.
I appreciate the arithmetic.
Catching men is my business.
And making the decisions is mine.
It don't look like much.
That the company store?
Yeah.
There's tools in there, and food, too, a-waitin' for us.
They'll be asleep pretty soon.
We better hunker down before somebody sees us.
They slopping' the hogs.
That means suppertime's over.
I used to feed the hogs at the prison farm sometime.
That sure was a nice farm.
Yeah.
All that machinery.
You know something, a fella get himself a farm, he'd have a pretty sweet setup.
Long as a fella don't have to scratch it out with hand tools and a mule.
Leastways you always got somethin' to eat.
I worked 36 acres by hand once.
my wife helped me.
Sometimes even my little kid.
Man, we never had enough to eat.
I didn't know you was married.
What happened to your kid?
He was just 5 years old when I left.
He don't even remember me no more.
Everybody winds up alone, not just you-- everybody.
That's the way it is.
One down.
5 to go.
I got an old man around someplace.
Last time I seen him since I was 14 years old was the day I got out of the army, and we spent half my bonus check getting lushed up together.
Ah, I got nothin' against him.
My old man...
He was a Bible-thumper.
Oh, he was always trying to teach us something.
What's there to know?
I used to work in automobiles, transmission man.
$1.80 an hour, so some fink driving a Cadillac could it drive around without having to shift gears.
That's pretty good pay.
Well, maybe for you it's pretty good.
You know what it meant to me? Saturday night in a gin mill being Charlie potatoes with a blonde, or maybe a redhead. Anything I wanted.
Then bright and early Monday morning there I was back in that pit with the grease in my eyeballs.
Yeah, somebody got to fix them cars.
Yeah, well, let somebody else fix them cars me, I want to drive them.
You got to buy them first.
At $1.80 an hour?
That's just a stopover for a secondhand Chevy.
No, not for me.
I got smart.
You're a maker or a taker.
Me, I'm a taker.
Yeah, that's how you wound up in jail.
I wound up in jail because I didn't know how to be a big enough taker.
I was just a stealer. You got to be a big enough crook so you can get away with anything.
Just a few more lights now.
What did they get you for?
Assault and battery.
Intent to kill.
Oh, that's great.
Man come on my land because I didn't pay the note.
I gave him an argument.
He pulled a gun on me.
I took it away from him. They put you in jail for that?
I whipped his head good.
Were you gonna kill him?
Maybe.
If they hadn't pulled me off him, I would.
You gotta learn to roll with them punches.
Yeah!
What are getting so mad about?
I ain't gettin' mad, Joker.
I been mad all my natural life.
I'm just telling you the facts of life.
I don't want to hear it!
I been listenin' to that stuff all my life.
From my wife, "be nice."
They throw me in solitary confinement, and she says, "be nice."
A man short-weighed me when I turned in my crop.
She said, "be nice, or you'll get in trouble."
She teach my kid that same damn thing.
I never could get that woman to understand how I was feeling inside.
All of a sudden, there was nothing left to say.
Ain't they never goin' to sleep?
I used to think if I could get her away someplace, you know?
Someplace where folks weren't always so afraid, maybe she won't be so afraid all the time.
Man.
There he go.
Well, that buttons it up for the night.
If we leave now, they'll be asleep when we get down there. Come on.
What's the matter?
Your white face.
It shines out like a full moon.
Don't take it wrong.
What am I going to do about it?
I don't know what you--
here.
How's that?
You missed a couple of spots.
Now just the meanness shines through.
Then we sure look alike.
Check.
Chain.
Can't see much.
I can't--i can't reach it.
I'm SLIPPING.
Grab a hold of the chain.
How you doin', Joker?
My wrist.
I'll bet we woke up this whole town.
SOMEBODY'S IN THERE.
I HEARD THEM.
HEY, OVER HERE!
Can you see anybody?
There's somebody in there.
The counter's down.
Where's Claude?
He's got the keys. Yeah, let's try the back door.
They're in there.
I know it. You stay at that window.
You hang on to me, Joker, the best way you can.
We're gettin' out of here.
Hey, come on back here, you!
Come on, now!
Hold it, you guys!
Here they are!
Hold it!
Looks like you 2 boys are in for trouble.
Mac, THEY HURT Joe REAL BAD.
Say! This one's white.
Here, Max.
You look pretty beat.
I figured sure we'd grab them sometime today.
Better take it easy. Here comes capt.
How about a nice hot cup of coffee, captain?
No. I thought you might want to know the casualty report.
Sure. Go ahead.
3 men.
How bad?
Legs.
Send them back. Someone's got to go back with them.
Pick someone out.
That's a lot of men out of the line.
What about it? Well, solly says the trail'll get no fresher.
So?
So I'd just like to make it a matter of record that I requested help.
You refused.
So it's your responsibility.
It is my responsibility.
Anything else you'd like to remind me of?
Just this. I happen to be civil service.
I don't have to worry about my job.
He's got a point there, Max.
Aahhh. If I listened to him, I'd be calling out the marines.
Still, if those men get away because you refused to call in help, you're gonna look pretty foolish.
And I'd have to print it, Max. Look, let me tell you something, Dave.
I got a wife and 2 kids, and a mortgage.
My job as sheriff pays me $6,800 a year.
It comes in steady. I don't have to work too hard.
It's a good set-up and I like it.
But, ah, don't frighten me about losing it.
I can always go back to practicing law.
Max, no offense.
You never made much of a living as a lawyer. Stop kidding yourself.
I didn't think it was possible, but I'm beginning to hate those 2 men.
I'll get them.
Rafe, get rid of the women and children.
All right, ladies, let's go.
WHAT YOU MEN FIXIN' TO DO?
OLD-FASHIONED PRAYER MEETING, MA'AM.
Let's go, now.
"Prayer meeting." That's pretty funny.
Give us a break, buddy, huh?
I ain't your buddy.
Which one of you did it?
Did you do it?
Why did you do it?
How is he, Sam?
He ain't come to yet.
He ought to be all right.
He ought to be.
Did he do it?
Are you protecting your buddy?
Well, it don't matter.
You can't do anything to us. We're escaped cons.
So?
So they're gonna be lookin' for us.
What are you going to do when they find us?
You're gonna be crow meat when they find you, that's what's gonna happen.
Well, you ain't gonna get away with it.
Nobody's gonna know who pulled the rope.
Don't you know there's a-a reward for escaped convicts?
Rewards always say "dead or alive."
Don't you understand?
You can't go lynching me.
You are?
I'll tell you the kind of white man you are.
Spit on him.
For god's sake, Mac. Go on.
Spit on him. Mac.
Let me alone, Sam!
We're just having a little fun, huh, boys?
WAIT A MINUTE!
Get out of my way, Sam, or you gonna have trouble, too! I've already told you, Joe's gonna be all right.
You told me fine.
You just don't give a damn, do you?
All right, the rest of you big men, you want to lynch them, huh?
You, glover.
You look anxious.
Go ahead, tie it around their necks.
You want blood, huh?
Here. Go ahead.
Go on!
Or do you want to burn 'em?
You want to burn 'em, huh? You wanna burn 'em?
Or do you want to burn 'em?
Go on!
Mac!
Go on!
Burn their eyes out!
Any more big men?
Joe's all right.
Took 6 stitches, but he's ok.
All right.
Lock them 2 up. I'll take them back in the morning in the wagons.
Put Mac in his shack where he belongs, and the rest of you go on to bed.
* long gone * ain't he lucky?
* long gone * to Kentucky
* long gone * what I mean * long gone Sam on a bowling' green * * now, bowling' green
* sewing' machine * a little kitten sittin'
* on a sewing' machine * sewing' machine
* sew so fast * sewed 11 stitches you know you must have been crazy to do a thing like that.
They might have beat us to death.
They still might.
What you got to live for, Joker?
You want to spend the next 20 years of your life on some chain gang bustin' rock?
It's better than being dead.
You ever seen a lynching'?
Why?
Because anybody as scared as you was, man, they... They got to have seen a lynching'.
Yeah, I seen a lynching',
I've seen what they do to a guy, how they drag him out of jail in the middle of the night, how a mob like that mob out there, they start drinking and then they start thinking, and big Sam, he falls asleep somewhere.
Then that mob comes in here, and they get us.
Then what?
That should be mighty easy for you, Joker.
You just go ahead and tell them that you're a white man.
Wait a minute. What are you doing?
I didn't hear any wagon being hitched up.
I'm letting you loose.
Why? What do you mean, you're letting us loose?
I already told you.
I'm letting you loose.
Wait a minute.
How about letting us have that crowbar?
Don't go to pressing' your luck too far, boy.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
You get caught, wasn't nobody let you loose.
You broke out yourselves.
Understand?
Yeah, yeah.
Run, chicken.
Run.
Hold on, man.
Wait.
I've got to rest.
We must have run a million miles.
How far do you think we run?
Man, you sure can run.
You'd kill us both if I didn't make you stop.
Well, why don't you say something?
What do you got to squawk about?
We got away, didn't we?
You got nothin' to say, huh?
You ought to be thanking me.
You didn't put up any fight. I had to do all the talking.
Look, man, don't give me that look.
You should have got what was coming to you after spitting in that guy's face.
Why you-- what's the matter?
You afraid of catching my color? You picking' a hand to me?
To you?
The big-shot taker?
You're nothing.
Go on, tell me all that big talk about Charlie potatoes when the chain's off and nobody's chasing you.
Come on.
You can't, can you? You can't because you're nothing.
You're not even a man.
You're a monkey on a stick. That cracker mob back there, they pulled the string, and you jumped!
You said one day we're gonna tangle, Joker, you said the time was gonna come.
And that time is now!
I'm gonna kill you.
That's right, white man.
Only it ain't so easy to kill me, is it?
PUT UP YOUR HANDS.
Come on up here!
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Cullen, there may be people around!
He bumped his head.
Let me go!
Keep him away from me! Don't let him hurt me!
He ain't gonna hurt you.
Where you live, kid?
Go on answer him.
Over the hill.
That way? Tell him.
Yeah.
What you doing out here?
Hunting. How come your pa let you out hunting by yourself?
He ain't here no more.
Who you live with?
My ma.
Just you and your ma?
Uh-huh. How come you chained together like that?
You taking him to jail?
Well, something like that.
You-you must have a lot of friends, a small kid like you.
A lot of neighbors. Uh-uh.
Just ma and me.
We work the farm. Sometimes on Sunday we go over to cumberland to visit my uncle George.
What's your name, boy?
Billy.
Billy, uh.
Come on. We'll get you home, Billy.
What's the matter?
Nothin', ma.
I'm all right.
What do you want?
Don't get excited, lady.
All we want is something to eat.
Come on.
Hey kid, come here.
Where you goin'?
You said you wanted something to eat.
Got a chisel and hammer?
In the shed, if I can find them.
Go find them.
Is it ok, ma?
Go ahead.
Where's his?
Get him some.
Go on.
You ain't feelin' so good, eh, Joker?
I'm feeling fine.
I ain't worrying' about you.
I got some coffee.
Thanks.
Him, too?
What are you looking at?
Where you from?
You can talk to me.
You don't have to be afraid to talk to me.
Gets lonesome here.
That's a nice picture.
I made it myself.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
It ain't so much. You can buy 'em in the store.
It's got numbers on it where you're supposed to put the colors, you know.
It's all right.
I like pretty things.
Yeah.
Did you paint that one, too?
That?
No.
No. I cut that out of a magazine.
Mm-hmm. What is it?
It says, "a scene of gay revelry at the mardi gras "in old new Orleans."
Where's that kid?
He'll be back.
Relax, Cullen.
He'll be back.
I've been to the mardi gras.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm. Is it really like what it says?
It's all right.
Oh. You mean it ain't like what it says?
No.
It's fine.
It's very nice.
I must look awful. I...
I've been doin' the washing'.
You gonna be stayin' long?
No?
They comin' after you?
There's a train... Tomorrow.
Hits the Ridge about 1:00 in the afternoon.
It's a good place to catch it, too.
Goes slow up the Ridge.
How come--how come you know so much about a train?
My husband used to work for the line.
I found them.
You got enough room for a swing?
You just hold that chain, Joker.
Now me.
Here. Hold it.
We cut loose now.
What's the matter with him?
What is it?
He's sick.
He got poison in his system.
Go heat some water, quick.
You stay where you are, kid.
Do like I told you!
Well, you get in there with him.
Now, all right.
They hit you.
And then what happened?
What did you do to them?
I don't know.
Next thing I know, the doctor's fixing me up.
Do you know what happened last night?
No, huh?
You, lady?
You.
Or were you deaf and blind last night, too?
They sent us women away.
Why?
Ask them.
Sam, what'd you do with them?
It's like I told you before, sheriff.
We caught them, locked them up.
They broke out and run away.
Those Jimmy marks are on the outside of the door.
They didn't break out.
Somebody broke in and got them.
Who was it?
I wouldn't know about that, sheriff.
You see, I run a turpentine camp, not a jail.
Who came for them, Sam? Who came and got them?
Sam, if you took them out and lynched them, you better tell me about it now. Because the dogs are gonna find them anyhow.
Why'd we want to kill them?
Appears to me like you're better rigged for that than us.
All right.
That's enough.
Solly, get going.
Now, wait a minute.
You've been rushing my dogs since early this morning.
They're bushed!
I ain't gonna let you, or anybody-- I'm tired of your complaining about your dogs!
Will you get going, or do I have to run them myself?
Wait, Max.
How about us? We're dead tired on our feet.
Oh, Max, have a heart.
It's gonna get dark pretty soon, anyway.
You wanted to be deputies, didn't you?
Well, you are, and you're under orders, so pick up your gear and get ready to move out.
Come on, come on. You call cumberland.
Tell him I want every man they can spare.
I want them to sweep along the west edge of the swamp.
Well, these men better be field-equipped.
It's gonna be dark before they get started.
I don't care when they start!
You get them moving!
All right, sheriff. All right.
You know that's the first time I seen him smile.
Yeah.
Where is he?
How long have I been asleep?
Couple of hours.
Where's the kid?
In the other room.
I better wake Cullen. No.
Don't go yet.
You're feverish.
You've got plenty of time.
What time is it?
About 2:00.
You been sittin' here all night?
Why don't you go and get some sleep?
I want to stay.
What is it?
I was just thinking of the last time somebody sat up all night taking care of me.
Your wife?
No.
It was a skinny old man with a mustache, red eyes, and a torn t-shirt.
He was an orderly in the prison hospital.
I had a sunstroke from working on the road gang.
I ain't married.
What's it like?
What's what like?
You know, prison.
How are you going to explain it?
Is it lonesome?
Yeah...
What happened to your old man?
He run out 8 months ago.
I been stuck here.
It must get pretty lonesome for you.
It's like that in jail, ain't it?
Yeah, it's like that.
Does it ever get real bad?
No...
No, I mean... I mean so bad that you just feel kind of empty inside, you know?
Like a big, empty thing.
All you want to do is fill it up with tears.
I'll tell you something.
You fill it up with tears, and you're a goner.
What can you do?
I fill it up with dreams.
You got to know about something before you can dream about it.
Oh, no, you don't.
Look, I was born 20 miles from here, and I just don't know nothin' else.
You don't have to know.
All you have to do is want.
Then you make up a million pictures in your own head.
Pictures?
What kind of pictures?
All kinds of pictures.
Different things, different places, different people.
All the things you ever wanted, but you ain't gonna get.
Sometimes it's music and bright lights and paper streamers, and I'm dancing in the streets.
Like the mardi gras?
Just like the mardi gras.
Sometimes I'm on a boat...
A long boat, and I'm going far away.
I'm going to places that I never seen before...
White sand... Hot sun...
And tall buildings...
Tall, tall buildings, reaching way up into the sky...
Tall buildings made of glass...
And there's always somebody waiting...
Somebody clean... And warm... And nice.
Is she beautiful?
I better get Cullen.
Is she prettier than me?
Oh, it's been so long.
I get the dreams mixed up with the real thing.
It's real now.
Don't go away.
I ain't goin' anywhere.
DON'T GO AWAY.
Hi.
Good morning.
You're up early.
I'll change your dressing. Thanks.
It's ok.
That feels just great.
Thank you.
I made you some breakfast. Fine.
What's that? That your old man's?
You're just about the same size.
You're a good-looking woman.
He must have been crazy to leave this place.
This place is no good. It needs a man.
Well, he'll be back one day.
Yeah? Mm-hmm.
Well, I won't be here.
Where you figuring on going?
Where do you?
I'm long gone, lady. I'm bound for rio.
Listen-- I ain't got time.
No, n-now, wait a minute.
What?
You like me, don't you?
Yeah, yeah, I like you. I like you a lot.
Take me with you.
The law's on my tail. I'm running scared.
I don't care.
Take me with you.
You gonna ride the freights with me?
We don't have to.
A car?
Uh-huh.
Oh, wait a minute! It's busted.
It won't start.
Get in and try it.
Do like I tell you.
It won't start.
How long this car been sittin' here?
About 3 weeks.
All right, hit it.
Try it again.
Well, I am.
Try it again!
I am!
It's the battery.
You got a crank?
I don't know.
Do I?
Put it in neutral.
It's in neutral.
Ok?
I gotta get Cullen. No.
We can't take him.
Well, why not?
Well, they'll recognize you in a minute.
They're gonna spot us anyway. No, they won't.
They'll be lookin' for 2 men.
We'll travel as man and wife.
Well, what about Cullen, then?
What's the difference if they follow one or 2 of you? You ain't hurtin' his chances any.
What about Billy? What do we do with the kid?
We can drop him off at my brother's in cumberland, double back and go south.
N-now, wait a minute, we're just going too fast.
I got to think. Honey, there ain't no time to think.
Will you come on?
All right.
Get packed.
We'll leave in a couple--
nice shirt.
We're going south.
We?
Me and her.
In this?
Yeah.
It runs.
Yeah.
You're wasting your gas.
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll be watching where the dogs are going.
That kind of makes me the bait, don't it?
Cullen, when we're traveling together, we're like a sign that says "come and get us."
He's too weak to travel on foot anyway.
You got the same chance alone, maybe better.
I'll fix you something to eat.
You got it all figured out.
Hey, you better go and get washed, Billy.
How far is it to that railroad from here?
Oh, about 12 miles if you go through the hill.
I'm fixing some sandwiches.
There's coffee there.
What do you mean, if I go through the hills?
Is there another way?
Mm-hmm. You can shortcut through the swamp.
The swamp?
Save you a couple hours.
Make it hard for the dogs.
You can find it easy.
Which way is that?
Well, go right up here by the shed.
You'll see a path.
Follow that until you get to the swamp.
The water ain't over a foot deep.
You'll see a big cypress over on your left about half a mile.
Follow that, that's all.
Then what?
Well then nothing.
The rest is easy.
You just head for the railroad, that's all.
Thanks for the grub.
Thanks.
Hey, Cullen.
Yeah?
So long.
So long, Joker.
Here, I'll burn that.
Not now, honey, please.
We got plenty of time.
Suppose--
we're going on a trip, honey, to cumberland.
Now?
Now.
Go on outside and take your clothes off the line.
To cumberland?
With him?
Yeah.
You like him, don't you?
Sure.
He's all right.
Well, go on.
Can I tell you something?
You better talk to that kid.
On the way.
He's a smart kid.
I wonder what they'll do to Cullen if they catch him.
Don't worry.
They won't.
What makes you so sure?
Look, will you quit worrying'.
They ain't gonna catch him because he ain't never gonna get out of that swamp alive.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you tell him right?
Well, there ain't no right.
It's all bogs and quicksand.
Why'd you do it?
Well, suppose they caught him. What if he told them?
What if he told them what?
What if he told them what?
What could he tell them?
Wh-- so they wouldn't come looking.
So--so we could have time.
Time for what?
Time! Time for us to get away, t-to get to a city, a big city, so big they could never find you.
Oh, look. Look. I got $400 insurance money saved up.
We could live good.
We could do all those things you was talking about.
We could go dancin' and-- and we could eat in restaurants every day and go to shows.
You could start a whole new life.
If we needed more money, I could sell the farm.
What should I do with these?
You're a smart kid like your mother, you think of something.
Go drop them down the well.
Yeah, like you dropped Cullen down in the swamp.
Oh, what do you get so excited about that negro for?
I did it for you!
You don't even know me!
For us!
For the two of us.
You don't even know my name.
Well, I don't care what they call you!
They call me Johnny. That's what they call me.
They call me Johnny.
Johnny.
Oh, Johnny.
You don't even know me.
Please. We don't have time.
You said so yourself.
They're coming after you.
You don't know anything about me.
No. No!
Where you goin'?
Get out of my way!
No! No, what'd I do wrong?
Please, what's the matter?
What'd I do wrong?
Listen to me, Johnny.
Please listen.
All my life I been waitin' to get away from here, from the mud gumbo and the loneliness.
I-I'd only see my husband 2 times a week, and he didn't come back.
I don't blame him.
But I don't want to stay here, either.
Oh, Johnny, I'm beggin' you.
Oh, please take me with you!
Don't leave me here, Johnny, please!
Charlie, bring in that water, will you?
Here you are, you can take your full ration.
You must have heard something, kid.
What'd they talk about?
I don't know.
You don't know, huh?
Ok. Beat it.
They're not around here.
Everything's clear.
All right, so they ate.
Then what'd they do?
They must have taken something with them.
Nothin' you can put them in jail for.
Lady, you're not cooperating.
I want to tell you something-- let's not waste any more time, frank.
Ok. Let's go.
Look, ma'am, I don't know what you been thinkin' or why.
Whatever it is, it can't work because, so help me, they're going back in jail.
Cullen!
Where are you?
Cullen!
Cullen, where are you?
Cullen, where are you?
Cullen!
What do you want?
Cullen, where you been?
I been lookin' all over for you.
They catching' up?
Yeah.
How come you're here?
What you want with me?
That woman told you wrong.
Why'd she do that?
She said if they caught you, you'd squeal.
What happened to your shoulder?
The kid shot me.
If we hit high ground, we could still make it.
Come on.
No, Cullen, I can't make it.
Come on!
Cullen, I can't make it.
Come on, man. You draggin' on the chain.
That dame. $2.00.
Why would she do a thing like that?
She was just trying to help you.
Yeah, well, she sure helped, all right.
Can't blame a body for what they don't know.
I blame her.
I blame her, all right.
Halt!
Sweetheart picked up the scent, all right.
They turned off here.
Yeah, they can't be far away.
Solly, bring up the dobermans.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter?
No dogs.
Max, do we have to go all over that again?
No killer dogs, frank.
Look, Max. We crossed the county line this morning.
I didn't want to bring this up, but you're out of your jurisdiction.
Take off the muzzles, solly.
Wait a minute, solly.
You're wasting time, Max.
We're supposed to find them, not execute them.
I'm giving the orders.
Go ahead, solly.
Just a minute, solly.
You make one move, and I'm gonna shoot them.
For the love of Mike, Max!
You gonna listen to me?
Hold everything, solly.
Come on, boys.
All right.
I'll take those trackers.
When we close in, I'll go on ahead by myself.
Anything happens to me, you can let the other dogs loose. Not before.
I don't like it.
You don't have to.
Cullen.
Come on, Joker.
Cullen. Run!
Come on.
I can't make it! I can't make it!
Hold it, Joker!
How you doin', Joker?
Ok.
You hurt bad?
I feel fine.
Sure you do.
You--you gonna make somebody a fine old lady one day.
Ain't it the truth?
Them the dogs?
Just rest easy, Joker.
Cullen?
Yeah?
We gave them a hell of a run for it, didn't we?
Yeah.
Charlie potatoes.
I'm mashed potatoes now.
So are you.
We're doing all right, Joker.
Yeah.

That's where your father hides his money.
It belongs to you.
- Say it.
- It belongs to me.
This farm would have been nothing without my land.
He only married me for the land.
He needed a woman to look after his home when his other wife died.
Killed her the same way he's killing me.
- He worked her darn to death.
- Ma, don't say that.
You're not gonna die.
When I'm gone, and you're old enough, take your rights.
He'll never die, that old man, he'll live longer than the mountains.
You'll have to fight for what is yours, don't depend on your stepbrothers.
Remember where the stone is, and when you need money, take it.
Everything here is yours.
You promise?
You promise to remember, Eben?
I promise.
Say it. "Everything here is mine and some day I'll take it."
Everything here is mine and some day I'll take it.
We must go back.
You mark the place.
Come.
Eben.
Gonna stand there moonin' all day?
She's been dead for years.
You and your brothers have gotta get home to dinner.
Weaklings.
In the prime of your youth and I can work you into the ground.
Spring.
The snow's off the mountains and the buds are out.
Spring.
Spring, and I'm feelin' damned.
Damned like an old bare hickory branch fit only for burning'.
I'm gonna learn God's message to me in the spring, like the prophets done.
Now you get back to work, all of you.
Crazy.
Crazy as a loon.
"God's message in the spring."
I know what he feels, the trouble in his blood.
You aiming to leave us too?
No, I'm never gonna leave here.
I don't wanna wander.
I wanna walk in my own fields, smell the blossoms on my fruit trees.
I wanna bring a woman here and say, "This is the work of my own bare hands."
You move stones, brother.
Let Pa hear the crazy calls.
One's enough for one family.
Get to work.
There's plenty of stones to clear.
I don't know when, but I'll be back.
No matter how long I'm gone, don't get any ideas that I'm dead.
I've sworn to live to 100 and I'll do it, if only to spite you. And you.
All of you, now, get back to work.
Let's go, boy.
There he goes.
Reckon he's drunk?
He ain't drunk.
Just smart.
Riding off, leaving us here, piling stone on stone, year in, year out.
Making stone walls so he can fence us in.
Maybe it ain't a bad idea, getting away from here.
- Where would you go?
- California.
There's gold in California, fields of gold.
A fortune lying on the ground, waiting to be picked.
- You'll never get to the gold fields.
- Don't be so sure.
- Where would you get the money?
- We could walk.
Walkin' ain't new to us.
Put our steps end to end, we'd be on the moon.
You won't ever go, Peter.
You neither, Sim.
You just wait for your share of the farm, thinking he'll die soon.
- Two-thirds is ours.
- We've a right.
You haven't any right.
She wasn't your mother.
It was her farm, he stole it.
He'd have a little rump of land without her.
She's dead now and it's my farm.
You tell Pa when he comes back.
I bet you he laughs.
For the first time in his life.
What have you got against us?
There's something.
Year after year, I've seen it in your eyes.
Why didn't you stand between him and my mother all those years, to repay the kindness she done you?
- There was always work to be done.
- We never had time to meddle.
California.
Boats leave out of Boston every week for the Golden Gate.
When Pa comes back, ask him for the passage money.
I'll bet he laughs for the second time in his life.
Six weeks already. No word from the old mule.
Real peaceful, ain't it?
- Maybe he's dead.
- It ain't that peaceful.
Goin' for a walk?
Maybe.
Nice night for a walk.
Gonna be a full moon.
What direction might a young fella go on a night of full moon?
Can't hardly guess, unless it was the road to the widow's house.
Eben?
Don't seem possible.
He's all dressed up.
You gotta take that into account.
All dressed up, all right, ain't no doubt about that.
Won't be the first time a young fella found himself all dressed up in front of Min's door.
Wouldn't be the last time, either.
- I'll go where I wanna go.
- Sure.
No need to feel touchy.
You got plenty of good company afore you.
- Right in the family.
- All the generations.
Animals. A pair of laughing hyenas.
I want nothing to do with you.
Eben?
Where have you been?
I waited.
- Celebrating in town.
- Celebrating what?
It's a private celebration.
Some news I heard.
- It's been a big night for news.
- You're drunk.
Don't you want to come in?
You're soft and warm and pretty.
Don't let's stand here talking like this.
Come on in.
That's what I came to tell you.
I'm never coming here any more.
You've been good to me, Min, but I'm through.
- I'm through taking what's left over.
- What are you talking about?
What's come over you?
Goodbye.
- It's me.
Get up.
- What'd you do that for?
I got news for you.
I'm the bearer of glad tidings.
- Can't you wait till we get our sleep?
- It's sun-up.
Don't you wanna hear it?
He's gone and married again.
- Pa?
- He's got himself hitched.
- What?
- To an Italian woman, 25 years old.
- And pretty, they say.
- Who said?
It's a lie.
You're drunk.
They're making fun of you.
I wasn't drunk till after I heard.
The whole village knows.
She was a waitress in a hotel in New Dover.
- Married!
- He did it to spite us.
Everything'll go to her now.
- 25-year-old... greenhorn.
- I hope she's a she-devil.
I hope she makes Pa wish he was dead, in hell.
