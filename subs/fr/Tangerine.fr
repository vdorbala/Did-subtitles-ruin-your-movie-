Merry Christmas Eve, bitch.
Hi.
Are we supposed to share it?
Yes, we're supposed to share it, bitch.
- How've you been?
- I've been great.
You finally got tits, bitch!
Bitch, the estrogen has been kicking in, the only thing it hasn't broken down was these fucking arms.
Everything else on my body looks good.
- Oh, honey.
- Don't you try it.
I look like the real thing.
So, I got some good news to tell you.
- I've been keeping a secret about me and Chester.
Girl... Whoo!
I know what it is! You're breaking up with him!
Thank God.
Because honey, if he's gonna be cheating on you like that...
Wait, wait, wait.
What?
You didn't know?
How the fuck would I know?
Girl, because everything that you've been hearing on the block about the girl that he's been with.
Girl, you are the first girl I've seen on the block.
Who is she?
Girl, she's some white fish.
I don't know.
Chester is fucking cheating on me with real fish?
Yeah, bitch.
Like a real fish girl, like vagina and everything.
I've been gone for 28 fucking days!
And you mean to tell me that he's been out here cheating on me with fish?
Do I know her?
I don't know.
I just know that her name starts with a D.
It's something like...
Danielle...
Desiree...
- Dee Dee...
I don't know, girl!
- Give me your fucking phone!
It was shut off.
I had to cover your rent last month.
I've been told you this was gonna happen.
All men cheat.
That's why they're called trade.
Do them just as dirty as they do us.
Out here it's all about our hustle, and that's it.
What are you plotting?
Merry Fucking Christmas.
Hey, girl, you back from vacation?
Bitch, it's a motherfucking disco out here, bitch.
Why?
Where the fuck is Chester at?
I don't know who the fuck this bitch is, but it's a white bitch.
It's a white real fish.
Girl, don't he have a lot of girls that he been messing with, girl?
Something with a D! Something with a D!
Desiree...
- Dominique...
- Destiny?
Bitch, I don't know what the fuck her name is, bitch!
Why do fish come in to our territory?
Cause when they're Jane, girl, they're jade.
Want to smoke some weed?
I got some weed.
Bitch, you know I don't do downers, bitch.
You know I'm an upper ho.
- Sin-Dee.
- Oh, hey, Alexandra.
Girl, give me a hug.
See you later, God bless.
OK, I got you.
Girl, calm the fuck down, it's not that serious.
Not that serious my fucking ass, girl.
I already told you, it's just a rumor.
You don't know just yet if it's true.
Bitch, I've been hearing shit in jail, I've been hearing shit out here.
I don't know the fuck is real anymore.
Sin-Dee!
Calm your ass down now or I am going home!
- Oh, girl, shut your ass up!
- That's it! I am going home!
White Boy!
Where the fuck is Chester?
I don't know. I haven't seen him all day.
What the fuck you mean you haven't seen him?
- Oh, hey, what's the T bitch?
- Girl, what's your T?
Have you seen that white bitch either?
I haven't seen anybody, leave me the fuck alone.
- Take these flyers. - OK, OK...
Please be there tonight.
Don't disappoint me.
I will. I will be there.
You want me to walk all the way to Vermont?
- Mary's at 7:00. - OK.
I will be there, I promise.
Now, I've got to deal with this bitch over here.
She's getting on my fucking nerves.
- You got any T on you? - No, I don't.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am sure!
You're making me lose my game.
This is what the fuck I'm dealing with.
I cannot take it no more.
Girl, wait, wait, wait.
I cannot do this.
I cannot do this, it's too much drama.
You just come out here and give me all this information.
To have me go handle it by myself. You're the one who told me anyways.
OK, OK, OK!
I will go with you under one condition.
You must promise to me that there's not gonna be any drama.
Because as soon as there's some drama, I'm out of there!
I promise. I promise.
Look at me in my eyes and promise!
I promise no drama, Alexandra!
Come on!
What the fuck you two looking at?
Bitch, like I am clockable!
You can't get it on me, bitch, you can't get it on me, bitch.
I am fierce as fuck.
I don't know what the fuck she was tripping on, girl.
True.
1351 Orange?
- Yes, please.
- Alright.
Is that a dog or a cat?
A dog.
What's the name?
Alfie.
Alfie is a very well behaved dog, huh?
It's so quiet.
It's empty.
And his breath always smells like he's been eating ass for days!
I mean when I walk into the room, it shouldn't always smell like homeless.
And those socks, why are those socks so fucking black!
That's not a pimp.
What do you see in him?
Why are you looking for him?
Girl, you right! You right!
It ain't his ass I should be worried about.
It should be that bitch. She's the one trying to come on my man. Bitch, you're smart!
I'm gonna fuck her up!
- That's not what I meant!
- That's exactly what you meant!
Because that bitch wants to try with me.
- I didn't mean that!
- I can give pussy, it's called a fucking tuck.
Oh, my God!
Look, there's Sin-Dee!
I haven't seen her for so long, girl.
She's looking good!
Oh, girl! What's up?
What's the T?
Sin-Dee!
Oh, my God.
So how was it, bitch?
Tell me the T!
Did you get a lot of trade up in there or what?
I want you guys to come to my show tonight.
I am so excited about that!
T was the night before Alexandra.
Stunning goddess... 7:00pm sharp!
Has any of you motherfuckers seen Chester?
- No, not me.
- Here we go again.
Girl, she saw hisself trying to cheat on me.
While I'm up in there, girl! Me, bitch!
- I wish I never told her.
- I heard about that fish.
And who the fuck is she?
Desiree!
Sounds like Desiree.
Girl, do you really want to go back to prison?
You just got out, mama.
I told her that too.
He act like prison is a bad place to go.
Mama, mama, you are so much better than she is.
OK, that's fine. But he's not with you. He's with her.
He left you for her the minute you went to jail.
- Girl, I am so mad.
- Why don't you just stop?
- I don't know what else to say. - The only thing I can say is this.
Get that motherfucker!
Oh, girl.
Another black boy on a board.
They all think they are goddamn Lil Wayne.
I remember one Christmas, I was like six or seven, my family bought me the cutest little Barney doll, that I would take with me everywhere.
And one day I put it inside the tub with me,
- to give it a bath.
- Oh, girl, she tried her out.
And it just stopped working.
It stopped singing the "I love you" song.
And I was just so upset.
The world can be a cruel place.
Yeah, it is cruel.
God gave me a penis.
That's pretty damn cruel, don't you think?
You speak English pretty good.
Where are you from?
I'm Armenian.
Yeah, I knew some people, came from Armenia.
Brought a lot of jewelry with them, when they got out.
They lived on that jewelry, had a restaurant.
What part of Armenia?
From the capital.
From Yerevan.
Shit.
I'm from Oklahoma, and I am a Cherokee Indian.
I got... I got a girl's name, Mia.
But, it's a feminine name in English, but it's not in Cherokee.
I was named like all Indian Cherokee babies are named.
First thing the mother sees when the baby is born she names that fucking baby.
So when I was born, my mama looked out the window, and she seen a red bird, flying overhead in the sky.
Cherokee Indian name for red bird is Mia Mia.
So, she called me Mia.
If you think that's a girl's name, it's not.
I'm glad she didn't look out the window and see an outhouse.
Can you imagine?
Look, hey, here comes "Big Shit Thompson!"
Right down the goddamn street.
Here he comes.
Oh, fuck.
- You OK?
- I don't know.
You got any aspirin?
- No.
- Oh, fuck.
- Is this Sunset Boulevard?
- Yeah.
You said you are going downtown, right?
I'm in no hurry.
I'm gonna take 101, OK?
I don't give a shit.
You do what you want to do.
You're the driver.
Remember, Sin-Dee. No drama!
Yeah, no drama.
Hello.
Hey, Mila, did you see Nash?
That little negro.
In the back.
Girl. Nash!
Hi, Nash!
Girl, girl, it's Nash, girl!
What's up, Sin-Dee. How are you doing?
- I haven't seen you forever. - Yeah.
It's been a long time.
It's cool. I'm glad you're out and everything.
Look at this, business is booming today. Yes!
How can I help you?
I just haven't seen you in a long time.
You are...
Chester.
I haven't seen Chester in a long time, either.
Me, neither.
He's been hanging out with my new friend.
Her name is Dani.
Something Dominique...
Desiree...
No, I ain't seen her, sorry.
Well. Listen, Sin-Dee.
It's good seeing you, but...
You know where the fuck she is.
So stop lying to me Nash.
And tell me where the fuck she is...
Sin-Dee, just calm down.
I ain't seen nobody.
This is a place for business, I am trying to...
You know who the fuck I am talking about?
Tell me where the fuck she is.
- Listen! First of all... - OK.
Get some Tic-Tacs.
Number two, I don't know who the fuck you are talking about.
This is my place of business.
And you are fucking my shit up right now.
Oh, shut the fuck up you lackey ass bitch!
- Where the fuck is she?
- I ain't telling you shit.
And you need to get the fuck out of here!
Look, I'm not doing this!
I'm out of here.
Cause you know...
I told you, I already told you!
Bye!
Girl! Alexandra, girl!
Hold on!
Just one more minute...
Would you just go with your homeboy and get the fuck out of here?
Oh, now you want to talk shit?
I'm not going nowhere!
- I don't know who...
- Where are they?
I don't support that pimping shit.
I stay on my side of the business.
I am morally opposed to the pimping shit.
So, listen. Don't ask me shit like that.
- Alright, listen, listen.
- Hello?
Half of the city is down at Schrader.
There is a food line and they are giving away $20 Christmas gift certificate.
Some shit like that, alright?
- Schrader!
- Food line!
Thank you!
Alright, come on, man!
For real?
Looks like you need a new pack.
Anybody have a lighter? Anybody have a lighter?
Anybody have a fucking light?
Do you have a light?
Excuse me. Hey!
Excuse me, hello!
Do you have a light?
Thank you.
Fuck it!
There are girls at the Christmas party.
On Olympic...
So fucking, just fucking go there.
Just go to... Take us to Olympic.

You know where Olympic, that's south of just fucking all the other streets.
You know that, right?
Just get us there. Just get us there quick before the other guys show up there.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, man!
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Get out of my car, come on.
Come out. Get the fuck out.
I'm going to Olympic and Fountain...
Oh!
I'm burning.
Who is gonna clean this?
Who is gonna clean this?
Just relax!
It's Christmas Eve!
Where is your Christmas spirit?
It's Christmas... It's Christmas Eve!
Move!
You fucking animals!
- I wanna ride it!
- He is gonna pay for it!
Like a trick nigger!
- I wanna ride it!
- Like a trick nigger!
He's gonna pay for it!
Go in, bitch!
I heard his dick is little.
Is it little?
I mean, damn.
Wow, what the fuck is going on?
Going in, mommy... Oh, my...
I make silicone boobs.
What do you need?
You don't have a baby daddy though.
- Bitch...
- You better go get fight, honey.
I was fucking your piece the other night.
Tell him to run me those diapers, bitch.
Don't forget my performance at seven.
- Oh, yeah. - That bitch looks two months pregnant.
How she going to come out here looking like a shitty ass.
Ugly ass bitches.
- Is that Louie or Houie?
- She had my date, girl, and he said that her tucker stink.
- No! - You lying.
She asked for $80 and he is a $900 a date.
- Shut up, please.
- The bitch is stupid.
Dude, your cab reeks.
I know, I'm sorry about that.
We are almost there.
It's hardly doing anything.
Let me see your dick.
- Why?
- You already know the routine.
I want to make sure you are not a cop.
I'm not a cop.
What can I do for you today?
- I just want to have some fun.
- What kind of fun?
I was thinking maybe BBBJ?
I can suck your dick with a condom for 80.
I can give you everything I have.
- Forty fucking dollars?
- Oh, come on.
- Are you serious? - Come on, come on.
My family is driving me fucking crazy, I just gotta get off.
- That's not any of my concern. - Okay, okay.
Listen. I can do all the work myself and jerk myself off.
Maybe you can just grab my balls or something.
Please, I will be super-fast.
I just, I just need...
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- You know what?
Since it is Christmas, and I do need the money, I'll do this.
But you better come fast.
Run me my money, put it on the dash.
Quickly...
- Hey, guys. Have you seen Chester?
- Who?
Chester, Chester.
Him and his fucking whores?
I don't do that anymore.
Even when I see Chester,
- I don't want to see Chester.
- Oh, you don't do dope no more?
So this is the fucking silver living line now?
It's not the fucking food line.
- You should ask Bob.
- Who the fuck is Bob?
The old man from the line.
He is a regular with Chester's girls.
Looks like Santa without a beard.
I've been clean for 30 days.
- I got my chip.
- Don't give a shit.
Can you just, give it a little stroke, please?
Can you shut the hell up?
No, you didn't pay for that.
- Come on just...
- No, no. You get what you pay for.
- This is what you paid for.
- Come on, you know you want it.
You see right through me, don't you?
Bob, Bob.
Are you Bob?
No?
Who the fuck is Bob?
- Who's Bob?
Who's Bob? - I'm Bob.
- Come on.
- Shut the fuck up.
You're not even hard yet.
I'm fucking hard. Shut up.
Is that it? That's hard?
Fuck off, fuck this.
It's not fucking working.
Okay but give me... Run me my shit.
Just get the fuck out. Just get the fuck out.
It's not working, okay.
There is no deal.
I'm not going anywhere until you give me my money.
What? I didn't cum.
You didn't get paid.
- It's all cool, just get out.
- No, no, you didn't cum, but because of the fact that I had to touch your dirty ass.
Well, you ain't doing your job so I couldn't cum.
It's enough fuckin' around.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
- Give me my shit.
- Get the fuck out of my car.
Give me my shit.
- Get the fuck out.
- OK, you know what?
Get the fuck... Give me my fucking keys.
- Nope.
- Not fucking funny goddamn it.
Give me my fucking keys.
Not fucking funny.
You're not getting your fucking keys.
- Give me...
- You're not getting these...
Get off, get... Get the fuck off me.
- Give me them fucking keys. - No.
What...
You forget I got a dick, too.
- Delee.
Delila, Daphanie?
Something starting with a D. Come on. D.
- Oh, Dana.
- I guess that's it.
Where is she?
You know where they're at?
A few days ago, she was at the Grand.
- Off of Vermont.
- Classy!
- Right? Simple.
- Sure.
She comes back, takes a piece of broccoli, eats it and was like... "Oh, I don't think I like this."
And I'm like, "You haven't even eaten any food yet."
So that was the beginning of it.
- After lunch...
- You stay with her, okay.
I stay with her, we go outside.
Next door, to the coffee shop.
I get Thai iced teas.
And I put them down.
- She drinks out of my straw.
- Nice.
Just classy, huh?
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, speaking of classy.
- Nice, Oh, jeez.
- Oh, boy.
- Fucking Alexander.
- Oh, boy.
- Have you not worked with Alexander? - No.
- Please help me.
- Get off the car.
- Off the fucking car.
- Get off me, help.
Well, here is your chance, if you want to go meet him.
- Nice try.
- Please help. Help me, Officer.
Alexandra, Alexandra. It's enough, let him go.
- What's going on?
- This lady just attacked me.
- He owes me fucking money.
- Is it true?
No, I don't even know her.
I got out of my car and she attacked me.
So a random woman just grabs you and attacks you.
Check the pulse.
Alexander.
Girl, what the fuck?
You know I don't do that shit.
I don't know.
What's happening?
- He owes me money.
- I don't owe you money.
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars?
I don't even know her.
- Why does he owe you $40?
- He knows me very well.
Ask him.
Is that your green Passat?
Well we have seen you cruising around for at least 45 minutes.
- I...
- So you didn't just park it
- and come down
- I just... I...
Like ten minutes ago I was driving around.
- I was on the phone. I realized...
- I've seen it. You know what, sir?
I shouldn't be talking and driving the car.
That's it.
That's it.
Why does he owe you money?
We made a business transaction.
A business transaction?
OK. This is what's gonna happen.
It's Christmas Eve.
We'll all go our separate ways.
Because I think that's a lot easier than calling our family and trying to explain why we have to be bailed out of jail.
What family?
Yeah. We know.
You posted a lot at the center.
Yes.
At Mary's.
- 7:00pm. - 7:00.
OK.
Thank you girls. I'll see you there.
- Can I help you?
- You working?
- Are you a cop?
- No, no.
Get in.
Make a right, right here on Las Palmas.
I like right here.
No. It's really busy on the streets today, so...
Are you from around here?
I haven't seen you before.
You are beautiful.
What about right here?
No. The block is hot over here.
There's a spot two blocks up.
OK. To the left right here.
So... It's so nice to see some fresh faces out here.
What's your name?
It's whatever you want it to be.
- Yeah?
- What... What can I help you with?
You girls usually have some exotic names.
Selena.
Where you from?
Does it really matter where I'm from?
You new? New in town?
I'm from Santa Clarita.
Can we do some French, please? Here.
Cool?
Are these real?
Yeah, they're real.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. No, no, no. Wait
I go down.
Pull it out. Pull it out.
Pull it out.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
- Is it tucked?
- Is it tucked?
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is this?
It's a pussy.
Get the fuck out of my car.
Give me my money.
Where did you put my money?
What the fuck is your problem, dude?
Get the fuck out of my car.
- That block you were hanging on?
- What a waste of my time.
That's not for pussies.
Alright? You shouldn't be there.
- Fucking homo, man.
- Get out of my fucking car.
- That's the wrong track for you.
- Fuck you, dude.
Don't work that track. Close the door.
Close the door!
Fuck you!
Scotty? Scotty?
What number is the party room?
So, me and my sisters... Every weekend we would go down to this skating rink, and every Friday night they would have like a disco theme, but you would have to bring, like, a guy...
And could never find a guy to go with me, so I had to dance with my sisters.
Hold on.
Chester has any girls here?
Maybe.
And who are you?
Does Chester have any girls here?
- Who the fuck are you?
- Dana?
- I'm not Dana - No, no, no.
I'm looking for Dana.
There ain't no Dana here.
Dinah?
Oh, shit!
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck out!
- Where's fucking Dinah? - Who cares?
- Get the fuck out.
- Where the fuck is Dinah?
Where she at, girl?
She's in there.
But you're not going in there.
- Watch me, bitch!
- Get the fuck out!
- Dinah!
Dinah!
- Get the fuck out of here!
That's where she's at!
She's fucking blonde!
- Where's she at?
- Get the fuck out.
She's in the bathroom!
I'm sorry, guys!
Dinah? Dinah?
Fucking Dinah!
Right here! In there!
What? Hey!
Hey!
Who are you?
What do you want?
Oh, my God.
Guys, shut the fuck up! Shut up!
We have neighbors, alright?
- I'm not getting kicked out.
- Is that crazy bitch coming back?
She's not coming back. That's what I'm telling you.
She's not coming back.
Girls, go! Go back in the other room! Go!
I better get a freebie next time!
No! You're not getting a freebie, alright?
Did you want me to call the cops?
Yeah, genius.
Let's get the whole precinct down here, you motherfucker!
You have the wrong person!
What's your name?
Dinah!
Razmik!
Hey! Alexandra, come here!
I'm so fucking happy to see you today.
Oh, my God. You will not believe what I have been through!
What happened?
What a sight for sore eyes!
Thanks for helping, you motherfucker!
- Hurry up!
This is like the second time this month that this happened to me.
I'm tired of being fucking nice to people.
I've got some money for you. Don't worry, man.
I think this is becoming our favorite spot.
- Hi.
- Just the wash.
I don't know what's going on with your man, but it has nothing to do with me!
Who are you talking about?
Fucking name? You want a fucking name?
How about a fucking name?
You know what you're going to get from me?
Me, you and him are gonna have a little sit down, a little chit-chat about what's really fucking going on.
Who the fuck is him?
I got eight dates a day!
Just tell me...
Merry Christmas.
You didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did.
What's that?
My performance. It's going to be at 7:00.
All of my favorite people are going to be there.
Miss Sin-Dee.
And Miss Dani....
Wait. Wait.
Sin-Dee? Which Sin-Dee?
Sin-Dee Rella.
Looks like someone has a crush.
Sin-Dee's back on the block?
Oh, yeah. She's back. She's back and she's going hard.
- Come here!
- Fuck you!
See you later on tonight.
I have to go.
- Bye. - OK. Take care.
Say you're not gonna run away on me again!
Not gonna run away.
All right. We're in agreement.
She's getting skinnier and skinnier.
Everyone comes to America and gets fat.
Even I gained weight.
But this girl gets skinnier.
I don't gain or lose.
You always weigh the same.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I spilled a little bit.
Where are the fruits? Fruits.
Coming right up.
She loves that dog.
She loves that dog very much.
I don't like dogs.
Maybe I'll get used to it.
Everything requires getting used to.
You'll get used to a lot more than that.
Again you want to smoke?
Eat something.
Please help yourself.
How are you, Razmik?
Good.
How are you?
Good.
Thank God.
How is Ashot?
Good.
He's growing old... With me.
Any business out there today?
Let her grow up a little and then Yeva can start working also.
Well, I came here to help with the child so they can work.
That's the right thing to do.
That's what grandmothers are for.
So they can help take care of my sweetie pie.
Ashken, she looks like you.
No, she looks more like Razmik.
Especially her smile.
Come here, sweetie.
Come and sit with Daddy.
Come on!
Shut the fuck up!
What are you crying for?
Shut the fuck up!
Get your fucking ass in here!
Hello! Where is he at? Where's your fucking friend?
Is this the person you were talking about?
You need to help me!
Call Chester!
You gotta call Chester!
What have you done to her?
Yeah, Chester! Where's Chester?
Chester's not gonna be cool with this shit!
You know Chester?
Yes, I know Chester!
Why me?
What did I do?
You gotta get her the fuck out of here!
Shut the fuck up!
Where's Chester?
I'm not leaving unless you tell me where he is...
Calm down!
He's at Donut Time!
At Donut Time!
Great!
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
When you see him, could you kinda not tell him that I'm the one that kinda told you that he was there?
Time to make the donuts, bitch.
Fuck up!
You know what?
I want to see Chester right now!
I can't wait to see that motherfucker!
He doesn't like you.
You aren't special.
I know I ain't special, but I'm his bottom bitch for the last two weeks, bitch!
And when he finds out what the hell you been doing to me, I swear to God, he's going to rip that cheap ass wig off your head and shove it up your fucking gaping asshole!
You might be his bottom bitch, but I'm his girlfriend, you fucking whore!
Oh, my fucking God!
You're Chester's girlfriend? Is that what you fucking think?
Chester's got a lot of motherfucking girlfriends and you are definitely not one of them!
What the fuck do I look like?
Like y'all niggas are going to Red Lobster and shit!
Oh, this my boyfriend!
You are so mad pathetic right now!
You're like home like waiting for him to call and shit.
That's sad. That's fucking sad.
I'm getting dragged around this fucking city is not as sad as you sitting home thinking your Chester's motherfucking girlfriend!
I'mma perform.
Don't worry.
It's gonna blow your fucking mind.
Getting my fucking hair thing.
Is that OK with you?
Girlfriend.
Shit. Fucking pathetic.
Girlfriend.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
I'm gonna put Kool-Aid on.
That's gonna be it.
She goes on forever. You know she goes on forever.
We're at Donut Time, fucking retard!
We've got something else to do first.
- They'll be here.
- Your fans are not here.
Alright, Miss Crawford?
You're going with me.
You've got no fucking choice, OK?
Is it a double date with Chester?
'Cause I would really fucking love that.
Come on, we're buddies now. We're buddies.
We suck the same cock.
How much you cost?
How much can I buy you for, huh?
How much you take me out for out there?
Look at your nasty clothes. You couldn't afford it.
My nasty clothes?
What's this?
Tricks 'R Us?
Listen, sweetheart, I'm bumping you.
Next year, OK?
Come on. Move your ass.
Ali, girl!
Alexandra, girl! I'm here, girl!
I'm tired, let's go!
I didn't think I was gonna make it here on time!
What the fuck is this?
Girl, how late am I?
I'm thinking I'm five minutes late, right?
What did you do to her?
Don't worry about her.
You gotta go on stage. Come on!
Look. My friends are here.
Come on. Just come on.
How you doing?
This one has one shoe!
She's from the hills.
She hillbilly. Come on, girl!
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you.
Come here, baby.
Has she eaten?
She doesn't eat this kind of food.
I will feed her later.
Let's toast to the head of this household.
All the best to you and your family.
Thank you.
Wishing you the same.
To your health.
Ashken, you have a great son-in-law.
He's great but he gets tired too much.
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do with this hair.
It's super straight like those fucking Asian hos.
Is that how you like it?
Yeah. Sometimes.
But not all the time.
It don't have to always be like that.
Let me do this.
Yeah.
Fix your face. Fix that mug.
That's what everybody is looking at.
- I need to get these eyebrows done.
- Yes, you do.
You know... Why did you bring her here?
Fuck her. We ain't worried about her.
She ain't nobody.
Today's about you.
Why you so up on her anyways?
With that fucked up face of yours.
Look at her!
You didn't have to Chris Brown the bitch!
I told you what I had to do today.
You act like I was playing.
You know when I say shit, I mean it, girl.
You wanna go onstage looking like this?
What, exactly, are you implying?
I imply that you use some of my eye. And let me do what I need to do.
Do you want my help or not?
Your highlight's all fucked off, girl.
You need to learn how to blend.
Your chestnuts are roasting on the bottom of your chinny-chin-chin.
What exactly are you doing to my face?
Trying to make you look better than what you looked like before.
You tried it.
Yo.
- I'm just... I'm so over it.
- Yo!
I don't even know what to do.
- Yo!
- Bitch, what the fuck you want?
Finish your own make-up.
You know how I taught you:
Highlight, highlight, highlight, contour.
Blush, blemish, bomb, bam!
Just stay over there.
I don't want to smell that shit!
I'm trying to enjoy it in peace, please.
I had a stressful day today.
Come on! Yo.
That's my shit.
It's my pipe.
I can feel it.
Oh, girl, hit her. Hit her.
She's smoking' up.
You gonna bring this bitch here, and now you smoking this shit!
Where the fuck is the red lip gloss?
Girl, you seen it. I know you did.
Chester took it.
Took it like a champ.
Let me tell you, Chester is a natural born sailor.
If you trying to upset me it's not gonna work.
I give zero fucks about you and Chester.
Oh, bra! He was all he could be when he joined my Navy!
Does your friend ever shut up?
No. That bitch been talking ever since I met her.

Girl, that's right. She did that.
Yes! She did that.
This next one is one of my favorites.
I hope it's one of yours.
Shit.
I need some more of that shit, girl.
Yeah, let's go.
I'm going to go to work.
Now?
Yes, I didn't earn a penny today.
But we're eating.
- So what?
- It's Christmas Eve.
So what?
I have no patience for her.
Make sure she doesn't make a fuss.
I'll take care of it.
Forgive me, but I have to go to work.
What do you mean you have to leave?
You just got home.
I haven't made a penny today.
I'm going to work for a few hours.
It's Christmas and I have guests.
It's okay, Mom.
It's okay. You don't have to make money today.
It's Christmas.
What do you mean?
If I don't make money, how do we live?
- It's okay, Mom.
- It's Christmas Eve.
Christmas is for Americans.
For us, it's another work day.
You live in America now.
Can you please tell her to close her mouth, please?
I'm not in the mood for this.
What did he say?
Yeva, what did he say?
He said he must go.
He speaks English but he doesn't celebrate Christmas.
He should have stayed home tonight.
I know but his real Christmas is on the 6th.
Today isn't his real Christmas.
He was the only man at the table.
He was pouring us cognac.
Now we have to pour it ourselves.
Mom, he's the only one working and supporting this household.
Let's not let this ruin our night.
Hey! It's that guy!
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.
You did good, girl. You sound good tonight, girl.
She sound good, right? She sound good, girl.
Tell her she sound good.
I mean... you did sing and you sang...
Alright, I'm going to keep it real with you right now.
This is not critical, this is not anything like rude, this is just being real with you...
Honestly, it sounded a little old.
Like, it didn't sound like new music.
It sounded like something I'd hear like a long time ago, know what I'm saying?
It's like...
Like I know...
Where I'm coming from is I know a lot about the music industry.
I know a lot of people in the music industry.
I myself sing.
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.
Do you know if this is still going on?
Oh, look at this.
That's cute.
No, she's gone.
She was up.
She was on.
She's done.
She left.
She was with a friend and her name is Sin-Dee.
Oh, the train wreck and the hot mess. Yeah.
They left?
What do you mean they left?
Yeah, they're gone.
The cool thing is though, I mean, look, you played in a club... you got people paying you to play in a club.
I mean, that's pretty cool.
What?
You don't want to talk about how much you got?
She don't want to tell me how much she got paid.
- How much did you get paid?
- Girl, she didn't get paid, girl.
- She paid to sing, girl. - What do you mean?
I don't even understand what you talking about.
I can hear you.
You paid... Wait. You paid them to let you sing?
That's... That's sad.
Hold up.
So you gave them 20 bucks and said, "Let me sing a Christmas song?"
Girl, stop, it's not like you could do any better anyway, girl.
Mother, I'm not discussing this.
I'm your mother.
If I don't talk about it, who will?
Mother, stop.
I'm not cleaning up.
I'm going to bed.
Come on. Come on, girl. We're here.
Hey, look who's back.
Hi, baby.

Yeah, you're cute.
I love your sweater, your fake purse.
What is wrong with you?
Are you on something?
Yes. I'm on. I'm gonna kick your fucking ass if you talk to me again.
She's been out of jail for 24 hours, she's already causing drama.
Drama!
You two, stay your asses here until I come get you.

Girl, where you been?

He is one of your drivers.
Yes. Of course.
I know him very well.
I need you to take me to him right away.
Please.
Where do you think he might be?
I am his mother-in-law.
Oh. He should be around the West Hollywood area.
I will find him for you.

Razmik? Where is your location?
Razmik is not working tonight.
I knew it. I told her he is not going to work.
What is the matter, Auntie?
How well do you know my son-in-law?
Mom?
We will find him but we may drive all night. Okay?
Yes, drive.
It's okay.
This thing busts in and drags me out by my hair, tries to beat my ass, then she took me to some boring-ass drag queen show.
I ain't no motherfucking drag queen!
I'm losing sympathy for you by the minute.
Hold up.
This motherfucking commotion, this is all that shit at The Grand was about?

Hold up, listen.
I don't give no kinds of shit about this bitch, alright, alright?
But please, please tell me you didn't lay a hand on Jillian?
Please tell me you didn't go crazy on her?
Why would I lay a hand on Jillian?
It's not like your fucking Jillian...
You're fucking Jillian too, aren't you?
Alright!
Listen, hold on.
I'm gonna have to fuck her up now too!
Calm down.
There's been some sort of misunderstanding here, alright?
Who's name you see tattooed here? Huh?
What's that say?
What's that name say?
What's that name say? That's your name.
Hey, Mamasan!

You know, you piss me the fuck off sometimes, Chester!
Hey, what's this say?

You just went from half fag to full fag!
- Alright...

Shut the fuck up. Come here.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.
They said you was legit, they didn't say you was a legit homo.
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
You talk when I tell you to motherfucking talk.
Did he just say you were getting married?
Yes, I proposed right before she got herself arrested.
Before I got myself arrested?
Actually you got me arrested when you asked me to hold your teener in my weave.
You're like, 'Oh, Sin-Dee, the cops are coming,
- why don't you hold my teener..."
- Are you fucking serious?
"I'll propose to you, we'll get married.
It'll be a pretty thing!"
Listen, listen, listen.
I can't be getting popped on that shit, for you it's just holding, for me it's intent to distribute.
Oh, my God, that is not the T.
This right here, is this what you fucking want?
Okay, okay, okay. Listen, listen.
You gotta lower your voice, they are gonna kick our fucking stupid asses out of here.
Mamasan, I'm sorry, I'm gonna chill these motherfuckers out.
- Stop yelling!
- Okay.
This is a business!
Okay.
Yeah, I'm gonna buy some donuts. Alright.
I'm gonna buy some donuts, and then the three of us are gonna fuckin' chill. Chill.
This weather in LA doesn't help to set the holiday mood.
There's no Christmas without snow.
Christmas is Christmas regardless of the weather.
Feels fake.
Los Angeles is a beautifully wrapped lie.
Agree to disagree.
I'm learning English.
- Mamasan, I like your hair.
- Alright.
What do you want?
Hurry up.
- Do you have watermelon flavor?
Don't you think we should be getting the Christmas donuts?
I mean it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.
Like, let's celebrate.
Mamasan, does your husband ever cheat on you?
- Who's gonna marry her smiling ass?
- The one who order her offline.
- Look how happy she is.

How are ya?
I'm wonderful.
Are you ready for me?
Listen, have you seen Sin-Dee tonight?
Yeah, I've seen her, baby, she's involved in some drama, but I'm right here.
No, no, I really need to find her, do you know where she's at?
Yeah. I know.
And?
And I know I need a cheeseburger.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Here, this is your cheeseburger.
And some French fries.
Where is she?
Give me that money back.
Here, I'm gonna give you this.
Where is she?
She's at Donut Time.
- Big spender.
- Go fuck yourself.
At the Long Beach Barbeque Festival, you said I was the only girl you ever truly loved.
That's true.
You know, people who love people, don't go fucking other people, Chester.
Shit, I did not motherfucking cheat on you.
I'm a businessman, alright?
I move product.
That's what I do.
Alright, sometimes I gotta test the merch is all.
- How many times did he fuck you?
- Don't answer that.
- How many times?
- He fucked me plenty, okay?
- How many?
- What is fucking wrong with you?
Ten?
Like, I never had a pimp who didn't fuck me.
So you had to check your merchandise ten times, Chester?
Alright, listen.
Not another word from you.
You shut your fucking mouth.
Twenty eight days and you mean to tell me nobody was taking care of you?
- Nobody.
- Nobody?
Nope.
Auntie, are you sure you want to keep looking?
What was your name again?
Karo.
Karo, please don't waste my time.
Take me to Razmik.
Chester, I was at Twin Towers, not fucking Wasco State Prison.
You really do have a crush, don't you?
Hi, Rizuku!
Okay, I will take you to your son-in-law.
But do you know why?
Because he has to understand that even if he does not respect himself he must respect his family.
Shit floats to the surface.
Sit your ass fucking down.
No, no, man.
She ain't fucking available.
She with me right now.
She ain't fucking working.

Bounce, motherfucker!
You retired?
I didn't know you retired.
- Yes, she fucking retired.
- Why didn't you tell me you retired?
Maybe I am available. Maybe it'll be a freebie.
- My cheating fiancé shouldn't mind.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Have you ever been to Santa Monica and Highland?
Oh, I don't remember.
You will remember.
Yo, yo, yo, listen. I got a query.
You married, right?
Nigga, you got a fucking wife. I know you do.
Yeah. So, when you be fucking my bitches, you don't consider it cheating, do you?
I'm paying for it.
It's not like we're getting married.
Oh, you see?
That's the shit right there.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You didn't pay for it, Chester!
He's lucky he's in America.
Imagine if he was in Armenia.

Girl, she shopped at the same store you shopped at!
Did Yeva bring you here? Is she here?
No, Yeva did not. Karo brought me here.
But she wore it better, bitch!
Nobody asked you, bitch.
I'm not going anywhere until I get an explanation.
Who are these people?
These are just regular people.
Come on, let's go home.
I said I'm not going to go anywhere.
Now you got her talking to him in Chinese!
Oh, I see... you are smoking marijuana with these people.
Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
If she's talking about me, I'll fuck her up.
She thinks I'm doing drugs.
Can you please tell her I don't do drugs?
- No, he don't do my drugs.

I'm going to have a heart attack.

You gotta tell her I don't know you.
This is my mother-in-law.

Corner of Santa Monica and Highland.
Tell that bitch do not call the cops!
Done! Done!
See what you did?
Oh, shit.
Who's shit is this?
This isn't mine, this is good.
Ashken, listen to me.
Let's go home.
Don't touch me.
What do you mean "don't touch me"?
Why did you come here?
Hey, there is no fighting in here.
- C'mon, get up.
- Don't touch me.
He hurting you?
I can call the police if he...
No, no, no. I'm not hurting her.
This is my mother-in-law.
She's just a little bit crazy.
No cops, please.
- Did you hear what she said?
- Razmik!
"Oh, how was the performance, Alexandra?"
"Oh, it was great.
Thanks for asking."
You think the government doesn't know about aliens and spaceships and shit?
You think they not keeping it a secret from us?
- Exactly. That's cool.

You are embarrassing me.
No, you are embarrassing us.
C'mon, get up.

Don't you feel sorry for my daughter?
So did Mr. Falafel have a big dick?
What?
Spit it out.
I didn't. I swallowed it.
I know... I...
I fucking set that one up, didn't I?
She's going to call the police.
In front of all these people, I'm going to rip your mask off.
Listen to me.
Get up.
Let's go.
I'm going to find out what you are doing here.
Razmik?
Are you people totally insane?
Why did you bring the baby here?
Mom, what's going on here?
Your husband is a dog. Dog.
Mom, what's going on with you?
You think I don't know?
I check your bank statements...
Every night he withdraws cash from your account...
What does he spend it on? Them.
This is embarrassing.
Please. Let's go home.
Mom, why are you getting involved in my family's affairs?
It's none of your business.
You can pretend to be blind but I cannot.
Get up.
We're going home.
I'm not going to allow him to get away with this.
- You see that?
You see that? - Sin-Dee, leave them alone.
Help me out, sister...
When your husband goes out and buys a girl like me, do you consider that cheating?
Sin-Dee, can you please not talk to my wife.
- Sin-Dee, please...
- Get your hands off her.
You even know their names?
Oh, my God.
- No, let's go.
- Of course he knows my name!
Say my name, say my name
Yo, you're the bitch they threw out!
Shut your ass up, girl!
What is the prostitute saying to you?
These are the type of hoes you like?
Dumbass hoes like this?
He comes home every night smelling like cheap perfume and you don't say anything.
I know my husband well enough.
Come on, let's go.
You think you know him?
You are blind.
Razmik, why?
Why what? What?
She's been trying to destroy our family from day one.
No, you are.
Razmik, just apologize to the bitch.
Don't be a pussy, yo.
Do not apologize for shit, yo!
Shut up and get out of our business, okay?
That's right, Ra-Ra. You should apologize for taking her to a fucked up hairdresser.
Oh, that's catty, bitch.
What is the prostitute saying to you?
Razmik supports the family.
He takes care of us.
What are you talking about?
He only takes care of himself.
I'm going home.
Mom, what do you want to do, destroy my family?
I'll see you in ten years, kid!
Oh, my God, I hate men.
I'm going to rip his mask off.
Sometimes a wife has to turn a blind eye.
Get her! Throw a donut at that bitch!
Have her, mama.

- Shut your stupid ass up.
Shut your dumb ass up.
Sin-Dee.
Sin-Dee, talk to me.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt you, sweetheart.
You know you're my best friend.
You know I love you.
I'd never do anything to hurt you.
Say something.
Can I at least take a cab home?
Oh, shit.
Like that Armenian dude just left, so...
I mean, I guess you're like shit out of luck.
Get down.
No wonder she's crying having a father like that.
Mother, please.
Sin-Dee...
Sin-Dee, will you just talk to me?
Come on.
Look...
It was only once.
It didn't mean a thing.
Yeah... I have a full house.
I called in another girl.
So... just hang, okay?
Please, Sin-Dee.
I'm sorry.
Great, now get the fuck out of here and leave me alone.
Now let me make my money and go the fuck home.
Hi, are we looking for a party...
- Oh, my God.
- Merry Christmas, you tranny faggot.
We pissed on your friend, bitch!
Oh, my God. They just threw fucking piss on me.
It's in my mouth.
- It's in my fucking hair!
- Wait, wait.
I don't have no fucking money for new hair.
Oh, my God, come on, come on. Take this off.
Oh, my God.
You know what, why don't I just take these off too, huh?
This has to come off too.
Girl... here.
Oh, girl.
Pull that down.
We'll just be bald together.
That actually looks good on you.
Now, as for me...
Previously on Washington's Spies.
The British have spies everywhere.
We need the same.
If you can smuggle cabbage, you can smuggle something more valuable...
Information.
Anna Strong is not your family.
You are a traitor, and an adulterer, and a spy for Washington!
I know how to clean up a mess.
__
Babes in the nest yearning to fly free.
Hungry chicklings.
Cheep, cheep, cheep.
Tell me, Henry, have you ever observed hatchlings in a scrape?
- No, Your Majesty.
- Ah, well, that's your problem, you see?
You don't observe nature.
But all of God's mysteries and secrets are revealed in the natural world if one has the wisdom to observe.
In the tern's nest, one will see chicks.
Tiny beaks open, crying for mother bird to feed them.
You see, it is the same for England and one's own colonies and dominions.
You are from the Americas, Miss Wright?
Aye, Your Majesty.
New Jersey.
But my sister lives in your Pennsylvania.
- Does she now?
- Aye.
And chirping more happily, I expect, now that your army has driven the accursed rebels out of her home in Philadelphia.
Quite.
Pennsylvania is northern, yes?
North of tobacco, that is.
- Hmm? - Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, a word?
- Not now, Bill!
Can't you see I'm in situ?
You may wish to remain so, sir.
Everyone out.
Shouldn't be long.
He grows tired of the exchequer within an hour.
Don't mind me.
My mother named me Patience so I would always have a little.
We should have all been blessed so, eh?
Robert Rogers,
Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of His Majesty's Queen's Rangers in America and your loyal servant.
Should we curtsy?
Or have you a petition for the king?
An appointment yesterday.
And the day before that and the day before that, too.
Oh, yes, and I recall on one of those days I made quite clear that you were on the list
- and you shall be seen when called. - Out!
Get out!
I'll finish sitting for my portrait and hear no more of this.
And get that bloody charlatan back here at once.
Please.
Miserable West Indies.
I knew... I knew we never should have...
How dare they tell me we owe?
I am the one who collects.
I collect!
They treat me as though I'm some sort of child.
I don't care what it costs in Maratha.
I don't care what it costs in the Caribbean.
Responsibility, he says.
Yes, responsibility.
Majesty, please.
We must keep...
Clean that up.
- Your Majesty... - What are you doing?
Why are you always following me around? Everywhere you go.
We're down on all fours, are we now?
Like a little dog, are we?
What, is it dog time?
Dog time?
Woof, woof, woof!
Yes?
You're a ridiculous little man.
Oi, you kicked me eye.
Don't need your eye.
Stop! Stop it!
Enough!
It's a bust of the king we're after.
Where has it gone?
Where have you sent it?
To Versailles?
To Benjamin Franklin in Paris?
How would you sail it past the embargo line?
Your Grace, please, I... I don't...
I don't...
Shall we open his head and look there for what you stole?
No, please. This boy is innocent.
If not France, then where?
America.
No, not America.
It is bound for the United States.
What's the name of the ship?
That won't help you now.
Then let us continue this discourse in my workshop.
Sir.
Shipping receipt from the Margaretta.
Left Shell Haven three days ago.
It's bound for Brooklyn.
"The Thoughts of a Free Man."
This is an anonymous attack on your leadership and it's been circulating in the camp.
Look, it begins by laying the loss of Philadelphia at your feet and it concludes with calling for your exile.
It compares you to the demon Ba'al.
There are rumors that Horatio Gates and Charles Lee have both written to Congress to have you removed as the commander-in-chief.
I requested an intelligence report on the movements of the enemy and you come to me with rumor.
Sir, I see myself as your eyes and your ears against all threats to your leadership.
Then what do you see and hear in Philadelphia?
Well, the... sir, the city having just been taken, I've not had time to cultivate a source there yet.
New York, then.
You have had sufficient time to get a person of intelligence inside that city.
The advice from whom would provide critical should we move to retake it.
What is the status of their defense?
I depend on you to enlighten us.
Your man Culpeper on Long Island, what word from him?
Well, it's... it's Culper, sir.
And it's still too dangerous to make contact.
I require a full report on New York Harbor before we move camp.
You shall engage Culper or recommend to me a new head of intelligence.
Yes. Yes, sir.
My courier is in the camp as we speak and he'll be ready to set sail tonight.
Right here, you.
Come on!
Right here, you.
Right in my lily-white nut sack.
Huh? Come on, you savage.
Make your people proud. Right here!
Come on!
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!
Drinks on me, fellas.
What did I tell you? Huh?
What did I tell you?
Right here.
Right?
I assume you put in the proper request for all these supplies?
Huh? Request?
No.
No, these are my gifts for the cause.
Oh, I see.
The black market, then.
Yeah, you do see.
Well, perhaps you might be getting the itch to make another trade tonight.
Maybe visit our old hometown, visit an old friend.
Nah, not tonight.
I... I'm afraid this is not a request, Caleb.
It is an order.
- An order?
- That's right.
I think I'm done with those.
- Done? - Yeah.
What, done with orders?
Orders, Culper, army.
I mean, it's all a bit of a tail chaser, yeah?
But with this here, whale oil, plucked from a fat Tory skiff off of New Haven and resold for £12 on Devil's Belt... that's the kind of profit that can make a man think about quitting the army
Loyal subjects harass at my pleasure and make a bit of coin on the side.
And the best part... the best part is the only one I'm risking is me.
Han Yerry!
Look, Caleb, this is not my order.
- It's Washington's. - Oh, Washington.
Well, you'll just have to tell him that you're following protocol.
See, Culper doesn't signal unless it's safe, and he ain't signaled in two months.
- So it ain't safe.
- Caleb, listen to me.
I am listening, Ben.
I'm listening now like I should have listened before.
Like when you ordered to let Simcoe live,
I should have listened to reason and put my hatchet in his head.
But I didn't.
And he survived long enough to kill my uncle.
Now that's on me.
You want to get Abe killed?
That's on you.
Two more here and we shall collect whatever drinking glasses guests used during hors d'oeuvres before we seat for dinner.
Yes, ma'am.
Circle, circle.
Everything comes round.
Thomas, do be careful with Grandfather.
- Don't lean on him so.
- He's fine.
So am I.
You're still recovering.
Mary, there is perfection and then there is obsession.
Whitehall has been without a wife's care for far too long.
And that was before it became home to soldiers and bachelors alike.
Well, I think you've done a miracle.
I agree.
In fact, I was trying to relate to Sarah the extraordinary circumstance of your journey here, but I just couldn't do it justice.
Will you please tell Sarah the story of the rebel raid?
The night they burned your husband's farm.
If only as an example of how to survive such.
We've had no raids in Oyster Bay, not since the regulars took the island.
And we're as safe here on Long Island as any can hope to be in the colonies.
But these rebels, they have no fear.
Or they have so much, they're numb to it.
They feel as if they have nothing left to lose and they hate us who do.
So after Ben Tallmadge made his retreat from our town, some of his men stayed behind to plunder what they could on the way out.
Abraham and I thought they'd gone.
And so we returned home that night.
Abe had just taken Thomas out to the privy.
We were spent and just wanted to sleep when five men showed up vowing revenge on the son of the magistrate.
Brave Ensign Baker stood against all five.
And they shot him dead.
Mr. Baker!
They couldn't find Abraham as he was protecting Thomas.
So they set fire to the house and fled.
How awful.
Everything gone.
No, not everything.
We had each other.
And together, Abraham and I have vowed to move forward and leave the past where it lay.
Mr. DeJong calling for you.
Thank you, Cicero.
Ah, Anna.
More jugs, please.
And, deary, could you be dearier and empty this on your travels?
How about I save time and refill right here?
Your ale's likely superior to what we've got stocked.
Oh, Major.
Welcome.
Is there a problem?
A problem?
No, I simply wish to drink an ale.
Anna, an ale for the major.
Two.
Op-op.
I actually have a matter to discuss with Mrs. Strong.
If you could procure the drink, Mr. DeJong, that would be helpful.
Um, Mary Woodhull is hosting a dinner, you see, at Whitehall.
And, well, you see, she's been trying to do so for the past month.
Host a dinner in my honor, that is.
As fortune would have it for Mrs. Woodhull and indeed the rest of us, the capture of Philadelphia is a victory worth celebrating, and celebrate we shall tonight.
And I would be honored to escort you there as my guest.
- Me?
- You.
- With you?
- With me.
Uh, not...
Allow me to... this is not a... gesture or an advance in any way.
I sincerely wish to honor the loyalty and the bravery that you showed on the day that you leapt from your rebel captors.
I betrayed my husband, sir.
It was his boat I jumped from.
You chose loyalty to your king.
There can be no nobler sacrifice.
I doubt the Woodhulls will see it that way.
It was Abraham who reminded me of your right action and who inspired me to take my own.
Abraham Woodhull suggested you invite me to his home?
No, that was my idea.
But he did acknowledge the difficulties that your families have had and felt that it's time for all differences to be put aside and for common bonds to be strengthened.
His words, not mine.
- Good evening.
- A pleasure.
Mr. DeJong.
Father, please sit down.
Mary and I can greet the guests.
I'm fine.
Will you please stop fussing, Abraham?
All right, all right.
Ah, there you are.
You all know Mrs. Strong, of course.
You look fine, madam.
Very fine.
Thank you.
And thank you all for having me.
- I think I may have that sit now after all. - Absolutely.
I'll... I'll help you, Father.
Major, perhaps a viewing of the Loch Lomond.
Hmm. Mrs. Strong, would you care to view Loch Lomond before dinner gets underway?
There's nothing like it in Setauket. You really should.
By all means, then.
This way.
Father.
The major wants to chime in on the wine choice for tonight.
We have Madeira, claret, and Virginia white.
He can arrange them in whatever sequence he wishes.
All right, don't kill the messenger.
No, actually, pork.
- Who is the artist? - Jacob More.
Specializing in portraiture, but a trip to Florence has broadened his intentions, it seems, and perhaps made him long for home.
Major, our esteemed magistrate wishes you to consult on a wine strategy.
Ah, indeed.
To battle, then.
- Signal Caleb.
- What?
- Where have you been?
- She's been watching.
- If not her, then her sewing circle.
- It's been over a month.
I've hado play my part, but I'm ready now.
For what?
This is for Ben.
It's instructions for a new code book.
It explains about Ensign Baker.
How he found the book, how I shot him, how I fired my farm and said Tallmadge's men were to blame.
You want to tell Ben the truth?
- What about Mary?
- Everything except Mary.
Excuse me.
IfWashingtonfindsout thatshe knows, he may think me compromised.
You are compromised.
She does know.
Just take it to the drop.
Signal Caleb.
I have the rest in hand.
Wait.
It's a stiletto blade.
I have to get used to wearing it under the suit.
It's the one I'll be taking to New York.
New York?
How?
You've no cabbage to sell and no hogs to trade as you've burned your bridges with the quartermaster.
What excuse could you possibly...
You'll see tonight.
Tonight we celebrate the victories in our king's name and we honor the sacrifice made along the way.
This year I learned the power of loss.
And I'm not speaking of my farm, but of when I nearly lost my father to a rebel bullet and our town nearly lost its magistrate.
A possibility which should terrify all of you considering it was I who had to prosecute in his stead.
- You performed admirably.
- Father, I lost the case.
That happens.
Not to me so much, but...
Loss begets gain.
It inspires change.
Your near loss pushed me to take up the law again and my loss at trial pushed me to want to win.
Especially against those who rape and murder in the name of independence.
My toast to you tonight is a promise.
I am to finish what I began at King's College.
I aim to study the law by your example.
And come one day, I will set out for New York to seek an apprenticeship to a barrister.
And even if it takes me a year of going there and back, I will see it through.
I've found my calling.
And you have made your father very proud.
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we eat? Let's eat.
No, no.
I... no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Abraham. I can't let you do that.
I'm sorry.
Mary, what are you... what are you talking about?
You know why you can't go to New York.
The rebels burned your farm.
They shot your father.
You are the son of the magistrate and they hate you for that.
You were a target of the Patriots and they will try again.
You think that I'm in danger of some kind?
There have been tales of... of kidnapping and killing of prominent Tories all over Long Island.
Ensign Baker died defending your farm.
You yourself were beaten and robbed on the way to York City and you wish to try again alone?
I agree with you, madam.
And that is why I shall guarantee his safety.
He shall be granted an escort.
Now that is wise.
I hire two every trip.
No, Major, I couldn't possibly afford to pay for such a...
There is no need.
I shall provide a top man from my own regiment who will go with you to the city and stay by your side till your journey is over.
That way, all of our minds can be put at ease.
No, I do not need...
I do not need an escort.
There's no shame in it.
It's a dangerous world out there.
Thank you, sir.
That's very generous of you, sir.
It is my pleasure.
It's done.
Let's eat.
- Worth waiting for. - Yes, isn't it?
"I believe that it is better to die honorably in the field - than in a stinking hospital." - I concur with that.
Cheers.
And this, this here, truer still.
Listen. "I believe that the proper methods of attacking, beating and conquering the enemy has never as yet been adopted by the commander-in-chief."
I couldn't have said it better myself, boys.
Who do you think is the author?
Someone fed up, armed with common sense and the courage to speak out.
Oi, Bradford.
You might want to be more careful with that.
Your anonymous hero makes common sense sound a bit like treason.
That's your commander that he's hacking at.
Not for much longer, I think.
What? What did you just say?
This letter is well-formed opinion based on fact.
Our esteemed commander left his flank wide open at Brandywine.
He lost the battle, cost America her capital city.
Is it treason to speak the facts in this army now?
Fine.
So... who would you see as commander?
Congress would likely choose Gates.
Gates, right.
Sure, or perhaps your man
- Charles Lee.
- Stand back.
Who was captured while with his mistress... fact.
Who escaped the enemy on his own.
What was she, a tavern wench?
No wonder he's been so absent in the field.
He's too busy playing with his whore pipe.
At least he has one.
And the sons to prove it.
While poor George must content himself with collecting young men.
Hold him down.
Hold him down.
Now we're gonna shut that pretty mouth.
With respect, sir, the only one who punches my friend is me.
You like that, huh?
Wait, Caleb. Hey there, boy.
Thank you.
And you were right.
You were right about Culper.
It's not safe to make contact unless he's signaled.
I won't move without you, all right?
Are you all right?
Yeah, it's just a scratch.
Are you all right, though?
What, have I really been such an ass?
Well, yeah.
You have.
I wish I could just walk up and ask that of Washington.
"Are you all right, sir?"
The man won't stand up for himself against his detractors.
I cannot for the life of me understand why.
Well, you know these officer types.
Always under pressure, shouldering burdens us foot-wobblers don't know or can't see.
Maybe give him some slack.
Shh.
Thomas.
I just don't understand, Richard, why we haven't done this before.
You didn't want to be celebrated.
Ah, well, I am lifting the embargo on that.
In the meantime, God night.
And good bless.
Where's Thomas?
He's asleep downstairs.
Aberdeen's with him.
Don't you think we should talk?
I think everyone had a splendid evening.
Just a splendid evening, wouldn't you agree?
Almost everyone.
Well, I know I did.
Dinner, drinks, and the theater all in one night.
I thought your performance was excellent.
I learned from the best.
An armed escort with me at all times.
Very clever.
I don't feel very clever and I don't wish to be your adversary.
Oh, no, don't be hasty 'cause you got a talent for it.
And I mean that to your credit.
You're much more than the blushing rose my brother first told me about.
And you, you are a far more interesting husband than the cabbage farmer that I was wed to.
Well, then we make a perfect couple, don't we?
If you hate me, just say it straight out.
There's no longer a need to be hiding the truth from each other.
We've both suffered the consequence of that.
You're a God-fearing man.
I know that, Abraham.
Our savior has tested us and has given us a second chance.
And I had hoped and I had prayed that the death of Ensign Baker, a good man, - an innocent man... - Mary, we're... would have opened your eyes to the folly of these schemes.
We are not talking about Ensign Baker right now.
Did his death mean nothing to you?
No, his death meant everything!
It changed everything!
I had tried at every step to do right, to protect my family, to stand for my principles, to stay out of the fight and true to myself.
And Baker is the bloody proof that I cannot do both.
Now, if I stop now, his death will mean nothing.
Abraham, please, you're hurting me.
He should never have been in our house just as Hewlett should not be now.
We do not need their laws, their taxes, or their protection.
And I will not stop my mission for Washington until the last king's man has set sail back to England.
Now, do you understand?
Who will protect us from King Louis when his ships return to reclaim New France?
You've been speaking to my father again.
You asked what I believe in.
Then why don't you just turn me in?
Abraham, don't you know?
Sometime during that night while I was watching our house burn, it became clear to me and it brought me peace.
I love you, Abraham.
I love your strength to stand on your own no matter what anyone else thinks.
I love the way that you care for our son.
I love your lips and I love your eyes.
And I will do what I must to protect you.
Even if that means protecting you from yourself.
Mary... I don't feel the same.
I know.
I know.
It's not as bad as I feared.
And I did fear that for so long.
You may go to New York to study the law, Abraham.
But I'm afraid that's all you'll have time for there.
- Woodhull.
- Corporal Eastin.
On your way to post?
You are my post.
I'm your new escort per Major Hewlett.
Oh, excellent. I see.
Well, when I'm ready to travel, I'll be sure to let you know.
My orders are to not let you out of my sight.
For your own safety.
I think I'm safe here in Setauket.
Are you?
"That the enemy has been greatly deceived having no reason to expect so valuable a prize as the city of Philadelphia with so few broken bones."
Tell me, monsieur, do you have gutter journalists in your country?
In France we would have them thrown in the Bastille.
General Lee, what do you read there?
What, this?
Just a complaint, sir.
Factional, anonymous.
You don't want to read it, trust me.
You read it, then.
"I believe that some people have too much interest in the continuance of the war and that the head cannot possibly be sound when the whole body is disordered.
That Washington, the bastard of Brandywine, should be flogged for his failure.
That the people of America have been guilty of idolatry by making a man their god.
And the God of heaven and earth will convince them by woeful experience that he is only a man."
Forgive me.
Please, do continue.
A greater load of horseshit I've not heard dropped in years.
Let me.
"That the honorable Congress... " ha!
"... In many cases has been too much led by military men."
Do you agree with that, Charles?
Of course not.
No?
Oh, I do.
Those squeeze crabs in Congress have been misled by military men, just the wrong kind.
They'd be better off listening to a man who'd venture into a cold night and come back with a victory.
But don't take my word for it.
I'm just the poor son of a drunkard.
A mere pharmacist's apprentice and thveteran of only 11 battles in this conflict for our freedom.
Now, of course, we cannot know who wrote this grub shite, but I would gamble he is not the equal of a commander who rides headlong in the fray and yet has never been shot nor captured.
An endorsement by the God of heaven and earth
- if there ever was one.
- Hear, hear!
Monsieur, may I introduce to you General Benedict Arnold.
General, this is Theveneau de Francy of the Roderigue Hortalez Company.
Will you join us, General?
Oh, sir, please.
It is an honor, sir.
Do you still have an appetite?
Always.
There is something I did not say when I made my proposal to go to New York.
Something I kept hidden and you should know it.
You should know that I intended to undertake a completely different task.
One far more dangerous and far less honorable.
As you may know, I never graduated King's College.
What you may not know, what no one knows is... while at King's I had a connection.
A shameful, misguided friendship with several members of a secret group of Patriots.
They called themselves the Sons of Liberty.
It's not a past that I am proud of.
But it is one that could be of use now.
You were right about the danger that we face.
There are traitors everywhere.
Now I wish to uproot them from the ground before they strike my family again.
Uproot them how?
I believe that the Sons of Liberty may still be operating in New York, albeit concealed underground.
If I can find them, convince them that I'm still on their side, I can deliver you the names of the whole group.
You wish to act the Patriot?
In order to catch traitors, I must play one myself, yes.
Of course, it... it won't do to have Corporal Eastin standing guard while I do so.
He may still accompany me to the city, but in order to keep up appearances, I must act alone.
Are not the Sons of Liberty the same cabal that sparked the Liberty Pole Riots?
The same men who murdered your older brother Thomas?
Well, you see now why I must do this.
And why I beg you not to tell my father.
He may never speak to me again if he were to learn of my past.
He may never speak to you again if you should die while exposing the rebels or while masquerading as one.
I will not sit home in safety and comfort while others are dying for their beliefs.
I took an oath in your presence swearing to defeat any treasonous conspiracies made against the king.
Now, please... let me fulfill my oath.
A wee bit late for visitors, isn't it?
You wish to see His Majesty or not?
Your Majesty, it is a most distinguishing honor to stand in your royal presence once more.
I do hope you recall the warm spirit of my prior audience just 14 years ago.
The same season you enjoyed my accounts of the methods used to trap a black bear in his winter den, eh?
I also hope that you recall my petition.
That being the discovery of the Northwest Passage and claiming it for England.
I humbly submit to you this proposal tonight.
It is said that you are the best hunter and tracker in America and that you are a... killing gentleman.
You will be granted a charter to discover the Northwest Passage.
You will be appointed command to raise troops.
You will serve on full pay as a major.
And all your debts will be cleared by the Crown.
There is a valuable piece of royal property on a ship bound for New York.
It is concealed inside a waxwork.
- Concealed?
- It was stolen from the palace, and must be recovered before it falls into the hands of the rebel army.
And it must never fall into the hands of France.
Never.
You are to find it and destroy it along with anyone else that may have seen it.
By my honor, I will see it done.
__
Brooklyn Ferry, October 14.
Troop number is lower since my last trip, but naval presence still strong.
I count two dozen warships in the harbor, including one ship of the line... the Eagle, Lord Howe's flagship with 60 guns.
The rest are lesser armed frigates and sloops.
Mr. Woodhull.
Land defenses on the Brooklyn side include...
He wants your papers.
There you go.
As you can see, I have permission from Major Hewlett of Setauket to enter the city.
"For legal studies," eh?
The next ferry should be here soon.
You can wait over there.
Don't see why I've got to lurk about here when I could be getting my Thomas milked in holy ground.
I'm afraid your pilgrimage will have to wait.
My bag, please.
Seems odd you need protecting all the way here only to hoof it about alone in the city.
Makes me wonder what you're really up to with your legal studies.
Don't wonder too hard.
You might hurt yourself.
My bag.
If Captain Simcoe were here...
Your orders are from Major Hewlett, not Captain Simcoe.
And I suggest you follow them unless you want to end up like him.
Your attention, please!
It seems we have a poet in our midst.
Shall we pause in our labors to better appreciate his verse?
- Hear, hear. Yes. - Ahem.
"Say, must I all my joys forgo and still maintain this outward show?"
"Say, shall this breast that's pained to feel be ever clad in horrid steel?
Shall no fair maid with equal fire awake the flames of soft desire?"
"'Fond youth, ' the god of love replies, 'your aner take from Anna's eyes.'"
Oh, dear.
What a mess you've made.
All those forms will have to be redone.
This came for you.
Perhaps it's your true love writing you back.
Boys.
God, I'm knackered.
You should have seen this girl.
Voluptuous breasts.
You know what I mean?
So, I showed her the silk.
Said there's more where that came from.
Never saw a woman drop her knickers so fast.
You like to read aloud?
Read this.
"To whom it may concern."
That'd be you.
Pray continue.
"Captain John Simcoe is hereby relieved of all other duties and is ordered to report posthaste to Major John André."
Posthaste.
That means immediately.
I'm afraid I won't be able to finish today's forms.
Oh, dear.
What a mess you've made.
Franklin calls it an armonica.
It mechanically recreates the tones made by rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine glass.
So he mechanized a parlor trick.
Perhaps, but this parlor is testament to the man's genius and industry.
Take his lightning rod.
Placed on a roof, it guides the energy from a bolt harmlessly to the ground.
And these eyeglasses.
The lenses are split, offering corrections for both close and distant viewing.
You can have the house, John.
I had no idea you admired the man so ardently.
What I admire is how he imposes no bounds on either his curiosity or his invention.
And now he wants to invent an alliance with France, which could turn this little rebellion into a genuine war.
Not if I have any say in the matter.
Ah, here are our libations.
Good.
Enough anticipation.
I'd like a report with my port.
Starting with your mole in the rebel camp, Charles Lee.
I admit, General Lee was a poor investment.
I may yet use him, but for now
I have my sights set on a bigger fish.
Thank you, Abigail.
That'll be all.
Trust me, General...
I realized what we need isn't a rival to Washington, but a man who has his trust, a friend.
Indeed, such friends as only the comradeship of war can make.
And who might this friend be?
A man whose leadership inspires both respect and affection.
General Benedict Arnold.
Ridiculous.
Unlikely.
Arnold is the best field commander the rebels have.
Yes, but as with many men driven to succeed on the battlefield, his virtues are often matched by his flaws.
Consider this. It's a report from one of my field agents detailing Arnold's role in the rebel victory at Saratoga.
"We were on the verge of winning the battle when Arnold, forced to serve under General Gates, asked to lead a last charge.
When Gates ordered him to stay in camp,
Arnold disobeyed."
The man is insubordinate.
To Burgoyne's misfortune.
"Ignoring a volley of fire, he single-handedly rallied the rebel troops, turning a rout into a win."
Poor Johnny Burgoyne.
Whipped by an apothecary.
But here's the rub.
Gates took full credit for the victory.
What did Arnold get for his troubles?
He was shot in the same leg he'd already been wounded in twice before.
It'll be some time before Arnold sees another battlefield.
Time enough for that wound to heal, but for the many slights to his vanity to fester.
Well, supposing he is ripe for turning, how will you turn him?
I think of it as a dance.
Right now I'm just trying to select the proper music.
Speaking of which, there's an affair at the house of Edward Shippen this week.
- Will you be attending? - Yes, yes.
Well, that is a dance, this is war.
- There is a difference.
- Trust me, General.
The key to victory is having the right man.
Our man in the heart of the enemy camp.
The city feels changed.
Petty vice and deeper corruptions have taken their toll.
That should work in my favor.
An acquaintance from Oyster Bay recommended a modest boardinghouse.
I figured breakfast was as good a time as any to get the lay of the land.
Morning.
I wondered if you could hard-boil a dozen of these for me.
A dozen?
Yeah, I got a lot of books to read.
These help me get through the long afternoons in the library.
Thank you, sir.
The city's inhabitants seem tired, on edge.
By my estimate, a sudden attack of 5,000 men could take them all and end the war.
- Here you are, Mr. Woodhull. - Thank you.
The last time I was here, you couldn't take a step without tripping over a soldier.
Now there are so few, a man barely feels safe on the streets.
Where are they all hiding?
Best to keep to your porridge, sir.
Damn! Not again.
May I make a suggestion?
You could hardly make things worse.
My father used to make me cry over this game all the time until I learned a few tricks for myself.
He'll take my piece.
Sacrifice for the greater good.
King me, you unlucky bastard.
I don't know about any soldiers, but those sailors, as you say, are on a tear.
- Navy, huh? - Mm.
Building new ships over at the west wharf.
Making it hard for a man to get his goods to market.
Well, I'll steer clear of the west wharf.
I like to study in quiet.
Good luck.
Thank you. And have fun with your books.
What a lovely cross-stitch.
Isn't it lovely, Rachel?
Yes, very.
I'm so glad Mary invited you to join us.
It was Major Hewlett's suggestion.
I had assumed that Mrs. Strong was too busy to be frittering away time with us.
You poor thing. You must be overwhelmed.
I can only imagine how hard it was to abandon your husband and be forced to serve as a barmaid in the tavern he used to own.
I didn't mean to sound disparaging.
Honest work is honest work.
No offense taken.
And as for my husband, I could hardly have gone on living with a traitor.
All men are rebels at heart.
It takes a strong woman to steer them toward a proper understanding of their obligations.
But such is our burden.
I had an idea last night.
I think that we should organize a charity.
A charity?
To buy provisions for families of soldiers who've died during battle such as poor Ensign Baker.
What sort of provisions?
Basic necessities... flour, salt, good cloth, Bibles, perhaps.
I think that's a wonderful idea.
Still, I wonder how far our money will go with everything so dear these days.
It's a pity about the poor soldiers.
But more the pity for us if our own families suffer for it.
There could be a way to lighten the burden.
As you all know, my employer
Mr. DeJong is tight with his guineas.
The man makes a vice of frugality.
Which is why he also buys his rum and supplies from a privateer.
A privateer?
You mean a pirate?
A privateer is licensed by the British to prey on rebel shipping, so it's all quite legal.
We could use Mr. DeJong's contact and with the money we save, the cost of Mary's charity could be quite manageable.
I don't approve of consorting with thieves no matter what they call themselves.
Surely you approve of helping widows and orphans.
It's settled, then.
Good day, ladies.
Um, Mary, has there been a delivery of a package for me?
What type of package?
I've been eagerly awaiting the delivery of an item from London by way of New York.
It would be quite heavy.
Not yet, but I will keep an eye out for it.
And I am very pleased to see you among this august company, Mrs. Strong.
I'm very pleased to be here.
It seems Anna has an august admirer.
Have you seen Major André?
No, I'm sorry.
I was at the market.
I'd like to know when he'll see me.
I've already been waiting an hour.
I'll go find out, sir.
Setauket.
That's where I know you from.
You were working at Strong Manor.
Tell me, do you miss Long Island?
No, sir.
I'm happy here.
I do.
I can picture it in my mind even now.
The last time we met, you stabbed a man in the neck with this over dinner.
An enemy spy I was hoping to turn double.
Your behavior was savage.
It was that same savagery, apparently, that landed you a court-martial.
Thank you, sir.
There's no need to remind me of that night.
It's still fresh in my mind.
- But...
- Yes?
I must confess to wondering why you've summoned me here today.
The Queen's Rangers lack a commander.
The last murdering savage who had that job went rogue on me, so I need a new one.
Someone who can bridle these men and ready them for a special mission I'm planning.
A demotion?
The Queen's Rangers are provincial forces, aren't they?
Don't touch that.
If I accepted that post, I'd no longer be a royal officer.
You'll retain your rank, Captain.
But not my uniform.
And at the risk of sounding mercenary, I imagine my pay will be cut as well.
Would you rather go back to the commissary?
I'm offering you one last chance at resurrection.
I suppose that depends on how you look at it.
It seems to me that while murdering savages can be purchased on any corner, those that can command other murdering savages are a rarer commodity.
What do you want?
Whilst we await this special mission, may I base my Rangers wherever I choose?
You'll have a ship at your disposal, so as long as I can reach out to you quickly, that shouldn't be a problem.
Then consider me at your disposal.
I already do.
You may leave at once.
Oh, and good luck with your new men.
Rogers trained them to hate British officers even more than the rebels.
I suppose I'll have to charm them.
Thank you, Major.
I'll tell your former mistress that you're happy here.
A detestable man.
But sadly sometimes such men can serve a purpose.
Abigail?
You want something?
Sir, I bought this at the market with the money you paid me.
It's for my son.
He's never had anything so fine.
- I was hoping...
- Say no more.
I'll have it sent out at once with a dispatch rider headed for New York.
Thank you, sir.
I'll wrap it up right away.
October 16.
My fellow boarder's tip proves well-founded.
Heavy naval activity at the west wharf.
Cannon emplacements at the Battery.
Nine-pounder on a naval carriage and a six-pound field piece.
October 17.
South Ward.
Two frigates, the 32-gun Alarm and 28-gun Sybil moored at Peck's Slip along with the 18-gun sloop Tobago.
General Howe may have taken most of the army, but he's left his mercenaries here.
Hessians, 200 foot.
More cannon on the Battery.
A dozen 24-pounders and half as many 16-pounders.
Canal Street.
Pits being dug every 50 yards, three or four feet deep and lined with stakes.
No doubt to wound men who attempt a night attack.
Troop barges moored at Old Slip.
They're secured by chains and booms to keep off fire rafts.
- Hello there.
Ahem. - Oh, pardon.
This isn't... your room is the next one.
Is, uh... is there something wrong with the eggs I've boiled for you?
No, I just... I like my eggs warm.
Who is it?
Major Hewlett.
Ah, Mrs. Strong.
I was afraid it would be too late, but then I saw your light.
How can I help you, Major?
I have received a package from Major André from Philadelphia.
I believe it to be another gift from your former slave Abigail to her son.
Cicero is asleep now, but I'm sure he'll be very excited to receive it.
I thought to bring it personally because I have some news which I think you'll be pleased to hear.
Seeing you with Mrs. Woodhull's coterie made me realize anew how difficult this ordeal must have been for you.
Forced from your home and unable to take part in the ordinary life of the town, all by the treachery of a man whose name you have to drag behind you like a sea anchor.
So, I saw the judge.
And he sees no impediment to you securing a divorce.
You can argue desertion.
I hadn't considered it yet, but here, let me...
The only caveat is that it might take more than a year.
And so in the meantime, I thought that I might make you a proposal.
A proposal?
I of course don't mean in the formal sense of the word.
I, um... thought that if perhaps you might be open to establishing a friendship.
Entirely platonic, of course.
"Play-tonic"?
Yes, owing to the ideals of Plato that is attributed to his feelings with the prophetess Diotima.
Feelings, he felt, unencumbered by the base Eros, was a surer way to the contemplation of the divine.
Yes, of course.
I didn't mean to presume.
Uh, good night.
Abigail's gift.
Yes, how foolish of me.
Good night.
__
__
Ah, a whiff of civilization.
- Why, it almost reminds me of Paris.
- London.
Tell me about our host in case I'm forced to converse with him.
The Shippens are the cream of Philadelphia society.
This ball is their way of welcoming us.
So clearly there can be no doubt about their loyalties?
Actually, it is a bit unclear.
Judge Shippen opposed the extension of royal authority, at least where taxation is concerned.
But he also opposed last year's Pennsylvania constitution.
Though perhaps because it threatened his own authority as much as the Crown's.
So is the man for us or against us?
Families such as the Shippens imagine they are above us, sir.
Well, above you, maybe.
And yet, with hair like that, they can't help but tower.
It's a miracle it doesn't topple.
- Who is...
- Margaret Shippen, their youngest.
And as for the high roll, it's the latest fashion.
Looks French to me.
Oh, there's Cornwallis.
I can't resist a chance to tweak Charlie about how Washington foxed him at Trenton.
A pleasure, Lieutenant.
Likewise, Miss Shippen.
The very instant I saw you did my heart fly to your service.
Do you quote Shakespeare to all the ladies?
Only the ones that stir a tempest in my heart.
I think you do, for that was well-rehearsed.
At least they don't kiss in the continental style.
It disorders one's high roll, and I've already put poor Freddy through enough today.
Have a care, Peggy.
You'll scare off all the eligible men.
- She's right.
- That's because to Becky all men are eligible.
And I expect when we're her age, we'll feel the same.
- Thank you, Becky.
- You're welcome, Becky.
By the time I'm Miss Redman's age, I expect to be on my second husband.
Ever the romantic.
But first you may want to find number one.
And who would you pick, Freddy, from this pool of too eager candidates?
I guess that depends on what one looks for in a man.
If I were Peggy, I would choose someone tall and dashing.
Maybe someone with an elegant little braid.
Then again, I'm sure our Peggy is immune to such superficial inducements.
Why, Peggy, he didn't even smile at you.
A man immune to the charms of Margaret Shippen.
What has the world come to?
I suspect he's more Freddy's type after all.
One can dream.
It's your deal, Becky.
Age before beauty.
Youth before wisdom.
I'll deal.
Now what is that infernal man doing?
Killing the ambiance, apparently.
Not so, apparently.
Major John André at your service, ladies.
What service are you offering, Major?
Why, a dance, of course.
May I have the pleasure?
May I have the pleasure, Miss Franks?
General, I heard a rumor that you can lead a minuet as expertly as a charge.
- Is it true?
- Perhaps.
But would your father approve, Miss Shippen?
Do you require his approval?
I thought you were the highest authority in this room if not this city.
Major André.
Miss Shippen.
So you know my name after all.
I know your family quite well.
Or of them anyway.
And I know nothing of you.
Except perhaps that you asked my friend to dance in an attempt to induce jealousy.
Do you really think women are so easily manipulated?
We're dancing, aren't we?
There's a fine line between confidence and arrogance, Major.
I'm sure you'll tell me if I cross it.
I'm reserving judgment.
Still, why not aim directly at what you're after?
When I saw you turn away other men, I knew a stratagem was called for.
If not to pique your jealousy, then at least your curiosity.
You like to play games, don't you?
As do you.
This may be a game to a man, but to a woman, the stakes are very real.
Even to a very lovely young woman?
A woman's allure rests on her saying no.
But no matter how lovely, she can only say no for so long or she ends up like my poor Becky, an old maid at 26.
You may have won this dance, Major, but who's to say there'll be another?
Is this the fate of every man to fall under your spell?
One whirl around the dance floor and then oblivion?
How many others do you think there have been?
I won't hazard a guess, but I'm sure you entertained some rebel officers before we came to town.
More tolerated than entertained.
What about that scamp who gave us so much trouble at Saratoga?
Benedict Arnold.
I hear he once stayed at your house.
When I was 14.
If my eyes are any judge, I imagine he must still think of you.
Do you?
I wonder, what games are we playing now?
Boccherini's minuet.
Dare I request another dance?
Just one more, perhaps.
No breakfast?
You paid for it.
Uh, no. I can't, I'm afraid. Long trip back.
Best be on my way.
How about some bread for the road?
Fine.
Let's see.
Here you go.
Law studies off to a good start?
I hope so.
It's not really for me to judge.
For a man cocooned with his books, you managed quite a sunburn.
Old habits, I suppose.
I was a farmer before I took up the law.
I thought why waste the whole of a lovely day indoors when I could be out committing my case to memory?
Thank you.
I had a lovely stay.
And I expect I'll be back soon.
You look like the cat that ate the cream.
I think the law agrees with me.
I'm glad someone enjoyed himself.
Well, you keep dreaming of holy ground, Mr. Eastin.
Someday you'll get your just reward.
Hold on there.
Need to see those bags first.
Right.
There you go.
What's this?
- Lunch.
- Let's see it.
If you must.
Looks like someone's robbed the henhouse.
Can you spare a couple?
Help yourself.
Just avoid the brown ones, though.
They're a little sour.
What brown ones?
All right, then.
Off you go.
- Hyah. Hyah. - Wait, wait, wait.
I think I left something in my room.
I don't want to risk getting caught after dark. Hey!
Back already?
I think I left something in my room.
It's already been rented out.
- Oh. - You don't look well, sir.
Here you go. I still owe you breakfast.
I didn't order this.
I know, but you didn't stick to your porridge either, did you?
I wondered if you could hard-boil a dozen of these for me.
How about some bread for the road?
Fine.
It was hard-boiled.
That one had a bitter taste. I couldn't serve it.
Then why did you take it in the first place?
Would you rather I had served it to that gentleman?
I'm sorry, I... I never got your name.
The name's Townsend.
Robert Townsend.
And I don't care to see you here again.
Hey, boy.
Boy.
My name ain't boy.
You calling me a liar, boy?
Oh, yeah, it's Aak... Aak-in-balls, right?
Akinbode.
Major Rogers' pet monkey.
You and that Indian.
What was his damn name?
- Awass-hole.
- Awass-hole.
Aak-in-balls and Awass-hole, that's right.
Only the Indian left when Rogers did.
But you're still here.
Why are you here, boy?
I earned my place just like the rest of you.
Right.
You're good with sticks.
Take it.
Go on.
See if I don't add your scalp to my friends here.
Well, what have we here?
If you're looking for Philadelphia, head to the river and make a right.
Thank you.
But I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
My name is Captain John Graves Simcoe and I'm your new commander by orders of Major John André.
That's a nice hat you got there, your lordship.
But it might get a little dirty where we go.
Trust me, I've no more desire to lead a provincial force than you have to serve under a royal officer.
These are my orders and yours are to obey mine.
If you do, I promise to mold you into the finest light infantry in the land.
Now... let's line up and fall in.
I think what they're saying, Captain, by not saying sod, is why should we obey a fop in silly togs?
I take it, then, that you already know all there is to know about fighting.
More than you, dandelion.
Then kill me, if you can.
You worry about the consequences, I see.
But who would ever know all the way out here?
You could kill me and then stuff my body in some animal's burrow and say you never saw me.
That is, of course, if you can kill me.
Thank you.
One more for your collection.
Now then, where were we?
No!
My hope, of course, is that our lessons won'.
Now, let's try this again.
Fall in.
What?
Never again, no horror movies.
Come on, no, the first kill was amazing.
Oh, look, he texted me like three times since we went in there.
Anything good?
No, just basically saying "what's up?" In several different ways.
What are you doing now?
I have to go home and study.
That's so lame.
No, come over to my house, we'll watch a movie.
We literally just watched a movie.
Yeah, but studying... sucks.
I know, I know, I got to.
I'll call you later.
All right-- hey, where'd you park?
So, let me drive you.
It's 50 feet away.
All right, fine.
I love you.
Bye. Love you.
Miss hannaford, in a minute... I'm gonna ask you to take a look at the statement you gave us... And uh... sign it.
Wait, the camera doesn't show anything?
Well, the camera in the foyer there doesn't show the bulletin board.
Can't you move it?
I mean, how many more of these do I have to keep on finding?
Well, then we'd be looking at the doors, which is why the store has the camera there.
Someone made that image and sneaked it past cameras to post it up there... For anyone to see, for a kid to see... Doesn't that make you feel like, i don't know, maybe it's not a good thing?
It is a graphic depiction.
It's not a crime, though.
It's not a crime to make 'em, not a crime to show 'em.
It's poor taste.
The girl in the photographs, she's someone, isn't she?
There's no way for me to look at this and even know if it's real.
Unless we can link it to some kind of actual criminal activity... A body, or ID on a missing person. But this-- no body, no crime.
Wait, but this one's numbered.
You saw that.
It's numbered seven at the bottom.
Well, it's probably some kind of a art thing... Some kind of a numbered art thing, street art.
What do they call it?
Uh... Outsider art. Yep.
Okay, has anyone else seen these?
Or are they just for me?
Is that what's concerning you here?
Yes, has anyone else turned them in?
No.
No, I don't think so.
So, they're art, but just for me to see?
So I would encourage you not to take this personally.
Great.
Do you know any photographers?
No, I don't.
Well, we got your statement, so I'm gonna ask you to take a look at it... And sign it... right there. There you go.
How can I be the only guy who wants the police in spearfish, south Dakota... To call the gruesome discoveries of the past several weeks the work of a serial killer?
Who wants to give me a reason why the gruesome photograph... That was found stapled to a telephone pole... Behind the local library isn't a photograph of the mutilated remains...
Of 23-year-old Savannah Simms... Who was reported missing some ten days earlier from a not so neighboring town?
The nature of the mutilation portrayed in the photograph... Made a definitive identification impossible at this time... And so I'm asking, "why can't it just be Savannah Simms, just this once?"
And the photograph that was found pinned to the community bulletin board... At the local wellborn supermarket... Can't it please be of 22-year-old Janet teasley...
Where do you want these new prints?
Who was reported missing 75 days earlier from yet another not at all neighboring town?
Can't spearfish, just this once, have a serial killer to call our very own?
I gotta see these pictures.
They're like literally the only thing that's not on the Internet.
Who do I know who can make that happen?
You read conversation-style blogs written by people from your hometown?
I'm inspired by any nut that takes pictures of dead people and posts them online.
I'm fucking inspired!
I'm- - I'm hard!
I'm gonna be fully erect here in a minute.
Oh, for a change. Hey! Hey!
That was the mushrooms, we talked about that.
Was it?
This guy knows I'm from spearfish.
He's doing this photography thing with his victims as an homage, as a nod, a nod to me...
Spearfish's most famous citizen and only known living artist.
Frankly, I'm flattered.
Didn't it say that there isn't a serial killer?
These guys are always inspired by something, fucking copy cat.
What I need is a cigarette.
Chew the gum.
Fuck the gum.
The gum tastes like garlic semen.
Yeah, I just feel bad for the girls.
They're getting killed and then mutilated... And then put on display.
It's fucking awful.
Here we have a model who feels something for another model...
Because she's dead and mutilated and displayed like a piece of meat.
This is news.
Shut up, asshole.
Huh? I said, "shut-- don't smile.
How about that?
You like that?
Best picture of the day, easy.
What time is it?
It's uh, 6:00.
6:00 in the evening, fuck me.
Okay, you know what we gotta do?
We're gonna call those-- those perfume campaign people. What the fuck is that called?
The bay campaign.
The bay campaign.
The bay campaign, thank you, the bay campaign. Stoner.
Call the bay campaign people and wake them the fuck up and tell them... That I finally figured it out, and I know exactly what I'm going to do for them.
I'm gonna steal this nut's idea.
I'm gonna hire models pretending to be dead people.
Actually not that much of a stretch.
And you think the bay people are gonna go for that?
I told them not to hire me in the first place... But they insisted, so this is what they get.
They get unidentifiable dead models.
We'll use those kids from the last shoot, trip and what's her name?
What's her fucking name, this one?
Uh, Victoria.
Victoria, trip and Victoria, dead eyes on both of them.
And rose here.
Oh, yeah?
Fuck me, huh?
Yeah. Okay, only if you're lucky.
All right now, somebody please, please, get me a fucking cigarette... Before I kill somebody and take their fucking picture!
Well, here you go. Door-to-door service and it's not even bright out yet.
That's gotta be worth something.
I told you last night that i didn't need you to drive me... And I told you again an hour ago.
Yeah, well, maybe you don't want your picture in the newspaper. The story goes somewhere, but it's about time that my face went fucking national.
Hey, come on.
Look, I'm trying here.
And who's that?
Oh, nothing, it's just Jill.
Jill, wh-- anyway, I gotta go.
Maybe I'll see-- yeah, well, that went great.
Nice job with the minivan, by the way, that's nice.
Yeah, sorry, they didn't have any escalades left.
So, we're gonna be dead in the pictures, right?
Well, I want to have my eyes open. Can I have my eyes open?
Like, it would look so cool if I was all like-- you know?
Okay, does my manager know about this?
Because I think it's disgusting.
I think it's brilliant.
It's a commentary on our fascination with death.
How we let ourselves-- we think about death just as much as we think about sex.
Well, if that's what it is, then it's awesome.
I'll tell you what it is, kids.
It's that every fucker in the country thinks they're a photographer now, okay?
And everyone can share an image, and it's awful.
It's awful, because it makes everything just like watery piss.
Then you have this guy who creates an image that you actually can't fuck with.
That you actually can't ignore, and when that happens, I have to ask myself...
"Peter hemmings, what is wrong with this picture?
"Are you just going to sit there and let this guy make you look like a dummy... "Or are you going to steal his idea and make a bunch of money, and then get high?"
And I think we all know the answer to that, don't we, trip?
Oh, hells yeah, man!
If I catch any of you instagramming... Or whatever the fuck it's called on this trip, you're all fired.
I couldn't be more serious.
Yeah, he's not kidding.
Let's have a party tonight.
Yeah, man!
Just a little get together, you know, invite some locals... Barbeque some shit, some ribs, sprinkle a little peyote on there.
Just a little get together, just to celebrate our arrival.
Cool, we'll just have to stop in town, grab some stuff.
My house has definitely got nothing.
Hey, how much longer?
I have no fucking idea.
It's been so long, I don't even recognize these trees.
Hey... check it out.
Jesus. 10,494... I've had anal sex with more people than that.
Get the fuck off me!
Jesus, I'm driving.
Keep fucking driving, then.
Yeah, it still smells like a wet sponge.
Oh-- I think this was where one of the pictures were found.
Note to Chris, call the cops and make an appointment for me to see those pictures.
An appointment?
Note to Chris #2... Get me a carton of cigarettes, a whole pallet.
I've gotta piss.
That's pretty.
I want to photograph this truck.
Look at the color, it's blood red.
It's so spot-on that it becomes a complete cliché... And it's such a cliché that it comes right back around to being perfect for me.
Whoa, that's heavy, man.
Get it for me, Chris...
Pretty please? Get this truck for me. Okay, I'll leave a note.
Capital idea.
Ladies, why don't you just sort of come over here and stand... Kind of lean maybe, on the-- on the hood.
Ready?
I don't know if we should be leaning on the truck, guys.
Chris, unclench, unclench. I know it's not--
I love it.
Here.
Okay, the only thing you really need to know about me... Is that Tequila makes me want to fight... And cheap wine makes me want to fuck.
I'm sure the lives of many brave young men were lost... In the refinement of that elegant theorem.
I love you. Oh.
Find everything you were looking for today?
Uh, yeah, yeah, we did.
Thank you.
You remember all the numbers... For the codes and stuff?
Oh, yeah, the scanner's been broken long enough, so... Kind of have to.
Oh, yeah-- makes it really hard to fall asleep sometimes.
Can't really stop it.
Yeah, I actually just read in the new yorker... It's called the Tetris effect.
It's when you do something over and over again, it kind of gets stuck in there.
You can't shut it off, you know?
Hm, you know, I had a real Tetris problem in the 7th grade.
It was really, really bad.
Yeah, I did- - I did, too, actually.
I think everyone did, it's kind of-- it's a good game.
It's...
So, are you guys from Minneapolis?
Uh, no, la, actually, Los Angeles.
What happened?
Did your plane crash?
Yeah, we were gonna resort to cannibalism... And then we found this place, so we didn't have to do that.
No, we're here for a photo shoot.
It's actually an ad campaign. It's--
Peter hemmings is shooting it.
I'm sure you've heard of him.
I haven't.
I'm surprised.
I thought everyone from here knew him.
He's also from here.
Is it that man over there staring at me?
Is that him?
Yeah.
It's very much my boss.
How's it going?
Hello.
I was pretending not to see you there.
We're just sort of doing an exposé on the local scene down here.
You know, sort of kicking around some rocks and seeing what scatters.
Exposé is a French word for naked, by the way.
It's okay, I get it.
Just because you're from here doesn't mean that you're a local.
Tell her I want to take her picture, Chris.
Actually, tell her that we're having people over at this house that we're staying at.
And tell her everyone knows it is the cabin on the lake road.
But tell her it's actually more like a house.
You'll make it sound cute.
Okay.
Tell her she can bring whoever.
She'll understand that you mean her boyfriend, just so it seems like you're cool with that.
Yeah, I'll tell her all those things, yeah.
Tell her she's beautiful. Give her a card.
Okay, well-- you obviously heard the man, uh-- yeah, I did.
So anything else today?
No, that will do it, thank you.
All right, that brings your total to $328 and 71 cents.
Put it on there, please.
Are you guys seriously gonna drink all this?
Hell's yeah, man.
There's my kitty.
Hello?
Here, kitty, kit--
that's not very nice.
I see why you're Colleen's friend, you're very pretty.
And I brought you a gift.
No!
It's okay.
Got dinner!
It's okay... ssh.
Smells delicious.
Eat up, pussy.
That's not a very good kitty... Is it?
It's okay.
Come on, it's--
come on.
Look what else I got.
Now I bet you were always the girl that never took a bad picture, huh?
Yeah, I bet that was you.
Should we call someone?
Do you want your phone?
You can call someone.
Who do we have here?
Colleen.
She's probably busy at work.
There's Kelly, there's... mom.
I'll let you call mom.
Mom's always know what to do.
You call mom and all this will be over, yeah?
All right, let's call mommy.
Here you go.
Go on, take it.
Hello,you'vereached maryanneo 'meara... Pleaseleaveamessage afterthebeep.
Mom, come get me out!
Mom!
Mom!
Jillhey,it'sJill ,stillstuck inhell . You know what to do.
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to call and see where you are.
I don't think I missed a call from you today...
But... blah-- anyway, call me back.
This is like the playboy mansion.
Well, that's what happens when you cast in a grocery store in fucking south Dakota.
And there were obviously no dudes at the store.
All girls?
You couldn't have one sausage for momma?
Are you gonna take pictures of all these girls?
Unfortunately.
They're terrible.
I understand.
Why couldn't the killer have just killed one of them?
I'd fucking best let Johnny fuck that snake.
If it was necessary, why not?
What the fuck is he talking about?
You know, bring it on.
Yeah, I know, dickhead, squeeze and wad and shit.
But if you think about it, it's like they don't even have any fucking arms!
The sad part is he's gonna get laid.
I hope so.
What's up?
Great.
Okay, come here.
Here you go.
Just stand right there, and you come and stand right here.
You-- no, no, you.
I'm just waiting, um, you know, for that moment...
Where things go from being completely fucking awful, like now... To coming back around to being really good.
So it shouldn't be that much longer.
And one, two... look at me.
Very good, get closer.
Jesus, are you guys in junior high?
What am I doing here?
Get closer to each other, come on.
Closer, closer, closer, closer.
Get inside of each other, go ahead.
Fucking yeah, yeah.
Great.
My god, okay. Switch passing thumbs.
If it's any more local girls, just tell them we're sold out.
You guys want some chips?
Hey, models don't eat... ever.
That was so mean, do it again.
Hi.
Hey.
Wow, you actually made it, um-- yeah, is-- did I show up too late?
No, no, not at all, it's awesome that you came.
Come in.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was supposed to meet a friend here and I guess she's still at work.
No, that's fine.
Here, come on, we're in here.
This is so much better when you look away.
I mean it.
Petty resentments of the local girl.
Oh, wow, it looks so appealing, all the drinks that no one's bothered to consume yet.
Yeah.
Actually... there might be something to it.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I don't know, I don't even know what I'm really doing here.
I'm so sorry, should I perhaps ask for permission... To take your photograph?
Permission is such a shit word, there's nothing sexy about it.
You know, in my line of work, we don't ask for permission.
Nobody talks to each other about permission.
What we talk about is release, that's what we give each other.
Colleen...
Peter.
Yeah, I remember.
Whoa! Okay, all right.
Didn't that feel so much better?
Okay, there you go.
It's the release, isn't it?
It just feels like you can get all of that tightness...
That's inside of you and just let it go.
Oh, whoa? Yeah, whoa, I don't really like my photo being taken.
Wh-- wh- - I don't like my photo being taken?
Why not?
What if I wanted to capture a photograph of you?
You're being incredibly selfish, don't you think?
I think you should just give her a second.
I'm so sorry, you're right.
I should at least wait until you have a drink inside of you...
Shouldn't I?
Yes.
Okay, please stop.
And if you touch the head like that, you're just gonna make it come.
Come on, baby, just release!
Just back the fuck up! Oh!
What the fuck, bitch?
No, no, no, no.
Easy for a second... you okay?
Colleen, wait up!
Hey, Colleen!
Are you okay?
Yeah, it takes a whole lot more than that to make me not okay.
Yeah, um, Peter, he's-- he's kind of a-- yeah, I know he is.
Yeah. Well, if you come back in, I'll- - I could talk to him.
Yeah, I have work tomorrow and i don't know where my friend is...
Who was supposed to meet me here, so-- okay, well, I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
For what?
Um, I'm sorry-- I'm sorry for Peter.
It's kind of my job to be sorry for him.
Well, he's Peter hemmings or whoever... So I'm sure he doesn't travel anywhere without his trusty team of apologists.
Right.
Yeah, I know, not your fault.
Yeah, um, you get service out here?
No, I don't.
Yeah, shit, me neither, fucking att.
Hey, uh, I hate to tell you this.. But what you did in there is just gonna-- it's just gonna make him like you more.
Yeah, but it was totally worth it.
Yeah.
Are you cold?
Mm... yeah, a little.
Hey, uh, excuse me, can we get one of those cot blanket things?
Having seen some movies, I'm pretty sure the guy didn't leave any fingerprints... Unless he wanted you to find them, in which case it becomes this whole labyrinth-themed... Thing and I'm really not sure you're ready for that, officer.
Well, we have to do everybody... Just in case, just so we can tell theirs from yours.
Oh, yeah, I get it.
I mean, you know, you might want to just check her prints... Since she's the one who touches her own car.
Oh, we already have hers in the file.
You know, from when she found the other photos?
She found the other pictures that the guy left.
Of course! Hey, it's cool, man.
I'm not gonna throw you under the bus, deputy.
I understand that you're upset.
I can see that.
But from where I'm looking at things, nothing happened.
And you're okay.
Somebody followed me here... So he could put that picture in a place where I would be the one to find it.
And we are gonna look into that.
I know this is scary, and we're doing the best we can to figure this out.
And until that happens, I'll have Daniels escort you home and follow you in his cruiser.
Don't even bother.
Colleen, hey!
Are you sure you're gonna be all right?
Haven't you heard?
I'll be fine.
Oh, shit.
You know, I called you a bunch of times.
You guys have fun, you and Jill?
I'm tired, okay?
You're all tired out, because it's special shit all of a sudden?
Pretty townie chick, out and about.
I don't want to do this tonight.
Yeah, what, 'cause you already did some of that la fag?
What? What?
What are you gonna make him your star?
Wait, did you talk to Jill tonight?
Jill?
No, why the fuck would i want to talk to Jill, what, so she can lie to me, too?
How did you know where I was?
How do I know that you fucking lied to me?
And went solo to a party?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Did you follow me?
What are you talking about?
Did you put those pictures in places where I could find them?
Pictures?
Is that what you're going on about again, those fucking pictures?
Yes!
The one at the store, and the library, and tonight!
Did you?
Don't be fucking stupid.
How did you know where I was?
Colleen? Just say it was you, so i can do something about it!
Beth randle fucking texted me when you got there, all right?
What is wrong with you?
Just-- you know, you think everything's about you, don't you?
But it's not.
See, I see you, Colleen.
No, you don't.
Now I need you to leave.
What the fuck?
Finally.
You forgot your wallet, asshole.
Ah, smells like you're smoking.
We've moved past that, Chris.
We've fucking moved on to bigger things.
This girl has found all of the photographs so far.
As far as I can tell, any time this guy wants somebody to find the photos, she does.
Coincidence?
I don't think so.
Yeah, well that seems pretty obvious, yeah?
So why her?
I mean, if I'm the cops... That's what I'm doing, right?
Yeah, I don't think that they're doing anything.
It's that whole Dr. Lecter thing, and what do we covet?
We covet what we see every day.
Yeah, well, she's the check-out girl.
Everyone sees her every day.
But somebody sees her differently than everybody else.
To somebody... she's a star.
If I'm the police, that's what I'm doing.
But fuck the police! I'm not the police!
I'm a fucking artist!
And it's a very fine line that separates me from our sick-fuck friend.
He probably has a PC.
Maybe I'm the one who's becoming obsolete.
Maybe I'm the PC in this relationship.
Maybe this guy... is a Mac.
I don't want any other girls, i want this girl.
I don't want anyone else.
For what?
For the big campaign, just her.
Well, what about the whole "dead models" thing?
It's been done. We take Colleen out of this shithole... And shoot her at the studio in la, that's it.
Why the fuck are we here?
Use rose or Vic, why does it absolutely have to be Colleen?
So that he can't have her.
Nobody makes me feel obsolete.
Nobody makes me feel like a fucking Dell computer... And gets away with it.
I want this girl.
And by the way, you do, too.
So get in line.
It's just something I have to do.
I can't stay in this town, it's a lot of stuff.
Well, you certainly were a bright spot.
Not here long enough for us to get to know you, Colleen...
But a bright spot all the same, everybody sure likes you a lot.
You know where you're goin'?
Not like I haven't figured it out before.
All right, your total will be $14.93.
How's it going, Colleen?
Oh, good, you know, slow.
It's tom.
Yeah, I know, sorry, I can't seem to really wake up today.
Long night?
No, not really.
Oh, thank you, let me help you there with that.
Thank you.
Have a nice day!
Got any big plans for the weekend?
Uh, probably, I'll just sleep.
That's not much fun.
Yeah, you're right about that.
Prettiest girl in town-- just goin' through a day until it's all over?
It seems like a terrible waste, if you want to ask me.
Hey, it's none of my business.
You know, I'm not really supposed to say this... But you can buy a whole case of these things at big lots.
Costs about half as much.
