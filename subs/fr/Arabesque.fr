- Professor Ragheeb.
- Send him in, will you?
Good afternoon.
Mr. Saeed?
Mr. Saeed's away, I'm afraid.
My name's Sloane.
Away?
Why is he away?
Flu, Professor.
Medical men aren't immune.
He asked me to look after his appointments.
I'm only checking your glasses.
You look as though I want to drill your teeth.
Do sit down, Professor.
Ragheeb.
That doesn't sound English.
Are you English, Professor Ragheeb?
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, small talk, merely small talk.
The weather's too dull and politics too explosive.
I certainly didn't mean to pry.
- May I see your glasses?
- I can't see anything without them.
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.
- Please.
- Have you been exposed to flu recently?
- Does that weaken the eyes?
No, merely the eye doctors.
There's so much close personal contact in our line, we can't be too careful.
Now... let's just try these.
There.
- Read those letters in the mirror.
"N, D."
"A, O, H, T."
Not bad.
Now the other eye.
"H, C, U."
"D, H, L, E."
- "M." No. "N."
- Jolly good.
Look up at me, Professor.
I want to put some drops in your eyes.
- Why?
- To dilate the pupil.
It's quite all right, Professor.
You won't feel anything.
- There.
That didn't hurt, did it?
- No, it was...
Here on the final slide is an example of a more cursive form of hieroglyphs, probably from the reign of the great Pharaoh Ramses II.
Now we can still recognize what many of the signs represent.
Here, for example, is the word for "heart", written simply with the picture of the heart.
But here, above the monster Amensit, who, as you can see, is part crocodile, part lion and part hippo, and who waits to devour the heart of the dead man is the glyph for a house.
Below it is a mouth.
These signs have phonetic value only.
They are followed by a drawing of a pair of legs, which, in this case, has no phonetic value.
As an ideogram, it does give us the clue to the meaning of the word
"to go forth".
Sex.
I thought there must be some way of attracting your attention, Mr. Fanshaw.
I seem to have been talking in your sleep.
That will be all for today.
Professor Ragheeb will be back tomorrow.
Good morning.
May I have a word, Professor Pollock?
If it's about that outstanding bill at the bookstore, there's a simple explanation: poverty.
- No, it's nothing like that.
- In that case, how do you do?
My name is Sloane.
Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane of Her Majesty's 42nd Highland Fusiliers, retired.
- Marvelous.
- Yes, quite.
I'm private secretary to Mr. Nejim Beshraavi of the shipping lines.
- The Nejim Beshraavi.
- I didn't think there could be two.
Mr. Beshraavi would like to see you in London, so if you'll follow me, please, the car is waiting.
Mr. Sloane, this is Wednesday.
Shall I tell you about my Wednesdays?
Right now: a healthy jog and a couple of tutorials, an indescribable lunch with the faculty at 12:45...
Mr. Beshraavi will pay you well for your time.
And I could use it, I don't mind telling you.
But, as I said, not on Wednesdays.
Good morning, Mr. Sloane.
You people really can't take no for an answer, can you?
What do you think you're doing?
Let me go!
Good Lord, a-aren't you...
Mr. Pollock, may I present His Excellency, Mr. Hassan Jena?
- Well...
Mr. Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Mr. Pollock.
I am Mr. Jena's Ambassador to Great Britain, Mohammed Lufti.
Mr. Ambassador.
Please forgive this unorthodox method of making your acquaintance.
Please, don't mention it.
There's nothing like a kidnapping now and then to keep the circulation going.
The fact is that there are very few men on this Earth whom I admire more than you.
You're a very great man.
No man is greater than the people he serves.
Your respect must be for them.
Yes, sir.
I... I didn't know that you were in England.
You are quite right. I am not.
You have not seen me.
The first favor I would ask of you is to help keep my visit here a secret.
Of course, sir. And...
And the second?
You know a fellow countryman of mine, Mr. Nejim Beshraavi.
The Nejim Beshraavi.
Yes, our richest and most powerful citizen.
We have every reason to believe he intends approaching you with a business proposition.
He already has, sir, but I turned him down.
- Oh, dear.
- Wrong?
Your association with him could have been valuable to the cause of freedom.
How?
All we know is that Beshraavi is opposed to our programmes and plans some violent exercise of that opposition in the near future.
We have to find out what he intends doing and when.
You want me to re-establish contact, accept his offer and see what I can find out?
We want that very much.
But you must not accept until you know all the possibilities.
The assignment carries a certain amount of risk.
Is that a statesmanlike way of saying that I could get killed?
Mr. Beshraavi respects no one's life but his own.
If you wish, I will stop the car and let you out with nothing further being said.
For generations, the Pollocks have devoted themselves to uncovering the past.
I think it's probably about time that a Pollock involved himself in the future for a change.
As soon as you have any information, you will contact Mr. Jena in London.
Ambassador-2779.
Words cannot express my gratitude.
Mr. Pollock, very good of you to reconsider my proposal.
I always try my best to cooperate with the very rich, Mr. Beshraavi.
Do sit down.
You mustn't mind Hassan, Mr. Pollock.
- Hassan?
- He's a peregrine falcon.
I've named him Hassan Jena after our beloved prime minister.
They share so many sterling qualities.
A sharp eye, a fierce dedication, and very sharp claws.
Hassan won't harm you, Mr. Pollock, if you don't separate him from his master.
He is excessively loyal.
You keep him well fed, I trust.
Of course.
Nobody's that loyal.
I won't presume upon your time, Professor.
I know how valuable it must be.
What do you make of that?
It's a copy of a Hittite inscription.
Second millennium BC, I would guess.
Take a date, Mr. Pollock, as a gesture of friendship.
I'm a very Arabian Arab, I'm afraid.
Friends?
Flesh, Mr. Pollock.
Hassan eats only flesh.
- I thought he looked at it wistfully.
- It must have been your fingers.
I want to know what that inscription means.
I want to know that very much.
May I ask an indelicate question?
- How much?
- $25,000.
Very well.
I won't quibble, $30,000.
You go right ahead and quibble.
How did you happen to get hold of it?
Let us say, I happened upon it by chance.
Well, may the... gods continue to smile on you.
Thank you, Professor.
I value your good wishes.
But I won't keep you from your work any longer.
If you haven't finished by 8:00 tonight, you'll be...
- Tonight?
- That is correct.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt your threat.
- If I'm not finished by 8:00...
- Then you'll be my guest for dinner.
I see.
If I should happen to run just a smidge over?
You'll find this house a comfortable place to work in, Mr. Pollock, however long it takes you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
What are you doing?
Oh, these English crosswords are devilish, don't you think?
- You're an American. - Yes, sir.
Indeedy-do, ma'am.
I don't meet many Americans.
Actually, I don't meet many people who are dressed like that either.
Do you like it?
Would you do me up, please?
- Oh.
- Can you manage?
Well, I... I always tremble when I'm happy.
- I take it you're a houseguest here.
- Why do you take that?
One doesn't usually arrive for high tea dressed in a nighty.
One also isn't a houseguest in one's own house.
Oh, it's your house.
I got the impression it was Mr. Beshraavi's house.
Nejim gives that impression with everything he borrows, but I assure you it is my house, and he's the guest.
Would you care to stay for dinner?
I'm afraid that our street urchin has already invited me.
How bothersome.
You are working on the cipher, aren't you?
Let's not talk about work. Let's talk about you.
Listen, I don't know what Nejim has told you...
There you are, Yasmin.
I hardly expected to find you here.
- In her own house?
- In the library.
Yasmin has so many talents, she has practically no time for reading.
I'm sorry to tell you this, my dear, but Mr. Pollock is as poor as a church mouse.
- Will you come and change for dinner?
- Excuse me.
Those slippers are absolutely beautiful, my darling.
- Are you wearing them for my benefit?
- Of course.
Mr. Pollock does not have your exotic refinements.
- He prefers nighties.
- She said it, I didn't.
Mr. Pollock, some Bedouins are in the habit of saying to their guests,
"All that I possess is yours".
I am not one of them.
Delicious, Beshraavi.
What is it, squab?
- Lark.
- Lark?
Good heavens.
They've been soaked in honey for eight days.
What about you, Mr. Pollock?
Or is the prospect too exotic?
I trust you'll notify my next of kin.
Go on, Mr. Pollock.
Courage.
Oh, I am sorry.
That's all right.
I've always had a sweet tooth.
I hate being clumsy. I despise it.
But you never are, my dear.
This is the first time I've seen you be so gauche.
You've dropped something, Mr. Pollock.
Well... so I have at that.
What do you suppose it is?
It looks like a little piece of folded paper, doesn't it?
Let's see if there's anything written on it.
Was that you?
I'm terribly sorry.
Let's see if there's anything written on it.
There is something written on it.
Don't keep it a secret.
What is it?
It's a prescription.
I suffer from indigestion.
All those dry books I try to digest.
Perhaps we can have it made up at the chemist just around the corner.
- Don't bother.
- No bother.
One of the servants...
It would be for them. It's absolutely unnecessary.
I think I'd better be getting back to work.
The dinner was delicious, and... that was quite a lark.
Well...
He certainly was strange, even for an American.
I'm sure you and Mr. Beauchamp have business to discuss, so I'll develop a splitting headache before your talk gives me one.
- Good night, Mr. Beauchamp.
- Good night, Miss Azir.
When are you going to let me show you around my bank?
The moment I find myself in need of refinancing.
You, I'll see later, no doubt.
Beauchamp, you've been oozing good fellowship all evening.
When a banker oozes, someone's in trouble.
Let us have your bad news.
I was too discreet to mention it in front of your guests, but do you know what they've been saying about you on the exchange?
Your brokers gossip like Arab women at the well.
They say when Prime Minister Jena arrives the day after tomorrow, he will sign the treaty.
They say the treaty specifies Anglo-American finance in return for a promise your country uses English and American tankers.
They say your ships will be laid up for good.
- Do they?
- If they go on saying that, old boy, in a week your shares will be down ten points.
Don't worry.
There will be no treaty signed, old boy.
I happen to have in my employ a most dependable soothsayer.
Psst. In here.
Now then, Miss Azir, I wonder if you'd tell me what this is all about.
Call me Yasmin.
At least while you're in my bathroom.
Now then, Yasmin, I wonder if you would tell me what is going on?
Professor Ragheeb didn't fall out of any window.
They murdered him!
Beshraavi?
I doubt if it was him personally.
- How do you know?
- What difference does it make?
They killed him, and they'll kill you too.
You'd better keep out of this.
Me?
Why should Beshraavi have anything against me?
He needs me to decipher the inscription.
- And when you've done it?
- Good point.
The message is too important for anyone he doesn't own to know about it.
What about you?
Lock, stock and barrel?
This is ridiculous.
We're in England, a civilized country, in the middle of London.
Over there is Regent's Park.
There's the zoo.
Over in Buckingham Palace, the Queen is probably playing Scrabble.
He can't own anyone here.
Everyone has his price.
How much, Mr. Pollock?
$30,000.
I did not settle so cheaply.
Why should you care what happens to me?
I care about all things that live, Professor.
$30,000 in exchange for your old age is a very bad bargain.
Do you know...
- Who is it?
- Yasmin, why have you locked the door?
Yasmin?
Can you hear me?
I was about to take a shower, darling.
You know how I despise locked doors.
Forgive me, Nejim.
People who lock doors generally have things to hide.
Would you care to search me?
Would I find your thoughts?
Well?
Darling, don't ask me to speak with my mouth full.
You know, at dinner, just for a moment, I thought you deliberately knocked over the plate and gave a note to Mr. Pollock.
Imagine.
That really is extraordinary.
- Jealous?
You?
- I'm jealous of your thoughts, Yasmin.
I'm jealous of everything I can't see or hear.
Your shower's still running.
- I'll turn it off.
- No, take your shower.
Maybe I won't tonight.
I'm so sleepy.
In that case, please do.
I want you wide awake.
There now. Wasn't I right?
Isn't that refreshing?
You might say that.
- You feel wide awake now?
- Yes... but I wish I weren't.
You sound very tense, my love.
Turn around.
Let the water run down your back.
- It soothes the nerves.
- I don't think it would.
- Nejim?
- Yes?
Why is Mr. Pollock working on that inscription?
It's a business matter.
It would only bore you.
- What was that?
- I dropped the soap.
- Should I pick it up?
- Oh, no, no, I... I'll manage.
Somehow.
- Have you got it?
- Yes, darling.
It's all right.
Extraordinary sensation.
Perhaps it was the way he looked at you.
- Who?
- Pollock.
Darling, if you start getting jealous over everyone who looks at me, it will do terrible things to your blood pressure.
I don't think you have to worry about college professors.
- Why not?
- They're only interested in work.
They're the most dangerous kind, my love.
They're such expert peekers.
If I were standing stark naked in front of Mr. Pollock, he'd probably yawn.
I think it's time I dried you.
Excuse me, Yasmin.
The phone.
- Yes?
- Mr. Beshraavi.
Yes, what is it, Sloane?
I don't know where Mr. Pollock is, sir.
- Isn't he in the library?
- I don't think so, sir.
He was your responsibility.
- What about the cipher?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, go and check.
Yes, sir.
- Mr. Pollock.
- Yes?
- Do you have the inscription?
- It's in my pocket.
I hope it's written with waterproof ink.
- It isn't there.
- It isn't there?
Must you mismanage everything?
I don't know where Mr. Pollock is either.
What do you mean?
You've got to find him!
Come up here at once, and bring that butler of hers!
What are you doing?
- This is no time for dessert.
- Well, they're good.
- Here, have one.
- Come on.
Come on.
- He is not on the ground floor, sir.
- You searched every room?
Every room, sir.
Sloane, Pollock was in your charge.
I trusted you.
- Now, you.
What's your name?
- Hemsley, sir.
Hemsley.
Yes, of course.
- What have you been up to, Hemsley?
- N-Nothing, sir.
Have you been disobeying my orders?
I-I work for Miss Azir, sir.
So you do.
I appreciate loyalty, Hemsley.
Tell me, how would you like to work for me?
I'm satisfied with my present position, thank you.
Are you?
Please tell me when you're dissatisfied with it, Hemsley.
Welcome aboard, Hemsley.
Thank you, sir.
Don't worry, Hemsley.
Here's a bonus.
Oh.
Well, thank you, sir.
Don't mention it, Hemsley.
Would you like another bonus?
Oh, not just now, sir, if you don't mind, sir.
- Where's Mr. Pollock?
- He came up here, sir.
Up here?
- Where up here?
- To this room, sir.
No hanky-panky, Mr. Beshraavi.
From man or bird.
Believe him, Nejim.
He means it. He said he'd kill me.
Close the door, lady.
Lock it.
Get him, Mustafa.
But carefully.
Whatever he does to Miss Azir, I will do to you, personally.
Don't think that I haven't enjoyed it. It's been a nice change.
- Thanks a lot.
Bye now.
- No, they won't shoot if I'm with you.
You still need me.
Need you?
Lady, I can't live without you.
Messy business.
My apologies, miss.
I'm sorry you had to see it.
Was I glad to see you?
- Are you with the police?
- Inspector Webster, CID.
How in the world did you know?
We've been watching the house.
Nasty customers.
My house?
Yes, miss.
Since Mr. Beshraavi's been staying with you.
Might I suggest we move along?
We'll have to get down to the station.
All right, all right.
Who's the ruddy nit who's broke my tank downstairs?
- I'm up to me neck in drowning fishes.
- There's been some trouble.
Oh, and who are you?
The ruddy Sheriff of Sherwood Forest?
Webster, CID.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
You better let me see your card.
I've got to make a report.
Somebody's got to pay for them fish.
Yes, of course.
All right, let's go.
I don't get it.
Whose side are you on?
What difference does it make? Let's get out of here.
You're not with the authorities, and you're not with Beshraavi.
And you can't be with Prime Minister Jena.
Who are you with?
Her.
Swell.
Ain't it a gas about my promotion?
Number three to General Ali himself.
He's coming round, waking up.
So you're with us again, teach.
I don't know whether I am or not.
Whose side are you on?
Don't worry about sides, daddy-o.
Yussef Kasim is the name.
Kyle Webster you've met.
And dear Miss Azir.
For a poor, subjugated Arab lady, you lead one hell of an emancipated life.
Mr. Beshraavi on the one hand, and Mr. Yussef Kasim on the other.
Do you get Sundays off?
Skip the college talk, teach.
To the point, daddy-o:
Where is the cipher?
- The cipher?
- Yeah, the cipher.
We know you've got it. No point fooling.
You're in the middle of nowhere.
The Marines can't save you for democracy here.
That cipher, where is it?
- Ask me later, alligator.
- Where is it?
I left it at Beshraavi's.
After all, it belongs to him.
Wrong again, teach.
He snatched it.
It belongs to this cat right here.
Where is it?
Miss Azir, after all we've been through together, couldn't you find it in your heart to put in a small word on my behalf?
He told me he had it in his pocket.
Tattletale.
- Where is it?
- Cool it, Webster!
There's a better way.
Nice business associates you have, Miss Azir.
Why don't you tell them where it is?
Because I don't know where it is.
- You told me you had it.
- You told me lots of things too.
Looks like we're just a pair of pathological liars.
I was honest about one thing.
I told you to keep out of this, didn't I?
- That you did.
- Then why didn't you listen to me?
Because I'm such a big know-it-all.
OK, teach, here's your chance to be a big "tell-it-all."
Somehow I get the idea you've seen too much television.
Webster.
Hey, Miss Azir, come on down here and I'll scrub your back.
Professor, can you hear me?
An earnest professor of math studied figures while taking a bath.
Professor, what did you do with the cipher?
Cipher, cipher, who's got the cipher?
- Number nine's got the cipher.
- "Nine"? What's that mean?
That's for me to know and you to guess.
Where is it?
That tickles.
Professor, you can tell me.
Where is the cipher?
Candy, I call my sugar Candy...
This is beginning to bug me.
Let's get rid of him.
- What are you going to do?
- Dump him.
- You heard him.
He doesn't have it. - Then who does?
That's what you're going to find out, sweet mama, as soon as you scoot on home and ask your rich sugar daddy.
Webster.
Olé! Olé!
Olé!
Olé!
Olé!
- We were quite worried about you.
- Were you, Hemsley?
How sweet.
But I expected to see you wearing a burnous by now.
I'm sorry, miss.
Don't sulk, Hemsley.
I'm in no position to throw the first stone.
Allah be praised, miss.
Yasmin, there you are.
I'm so delighted that you've decided to come back.
Your concern is so comforting, Nejim.
Your shower must have been quite stimulating.
It was.
But how do you suppose he happened to be in there, my pet?
I neglected to ask him.
All I know is he was waiting for me with those scissors when I stepped in.
I wonder what made him come up here in the first place?
I don't suppose it could have been your promise to keep him a prisoner here until he'd finished his work.
Oh, dear, I hope not.
I thought I was being so hospitable.
Westerners so often misunderstand us, don't you find?
Oh, I am exhausted.
Of course you are, my poor darling.
Let me give you a massage.
How can you continue being so good to me when I'm such a trial?
Oh, look at your poor shoes.
You must have done so much running.
What do you suppose happened to Mustafa?
- He hasn't come back yet.
- Dead, I'm afraid.
And servants so hard to come by these days.
I saw several possible replacements at the zoo.
My admiration for Mr. Pollock increases.
Probably Mustafa didn't feel like dying.
Mr. Pollock didn't do it, darling.
Don't stop. It feels divine.
It was Yussef Kasim.
The guerrilla forces.
I was wondering what they were up to.
I must say, they were a little miffed at you for borrowing their cipher.
I really don't think they had a chance to see it themselves.
Roll over, my love.
Do you think you can find the energy to tell me what they did to our professor?
Killed him too, I'm afraid.
That's heaven.
- So Yussef has the cipher now?
- What makes you think that?
Surely they were able to make poor Mr. Pollock relinquish it.
Mr. Pollock swore he didn't have it.
Mr. Pollock was lying.
Then I'm afraid he took the truth with him to his grave.
Before you came home I received word that Mr. Pollock had arrived safely at his rooms at Oxford.
A hardy race, the Americans.
I was also told that he was riding a bicycle and singing a very strange song.
A hardy and fun-loving race.
But tell me, my flower, I don't think you've explained yet how it happens that Yussef managed to leave you alive.
It's very simple, really.
I promised I'd work with him.
- By spying on me, you mean?
- Of course.
- How very amusing.
- Isn't it?
- Marvelous, in fact.
- I knew you'd enjoy it.
- Darling?
- Yes, precious?
- You are hurting my shoulders.
- Am I?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Better?
- Much.
You must have been very convincing.
It's a feminine talent.
Well, what a waste not to exploit it.
I was going to send Sloane to see Mr. Pollock to convince him to return the cipher.
But Sloane has so few subtle qualities.
I'm sure the professor would much rather deal with you.
I thought you were jealous of the professor.
I'm too busy now being jealous of Yussef.
- Hello.
- Mr. Pollock.
One moment, please, for the Prime Minister.
Mr. Pollock.
Good morning, sir.
We've been trying to contact you, Mr. Pollock.
We were very worried about you.
No more than I was, sir.
- Did you get the information?
- No, sir.
- But you do have the cipher?
- No, sir.
Do you know who does?
- I think so, sir.
- Will you be getting it then?
- No, sir.
- Why is that, Mr. Pollock?
- No guts, sir.
- I beg your pardon?
As long as you needed someone to sit down and work, I was your man.
But the situation has changed somewhat.
What you need now is someone with a Ph.D in roughhouse.
I did warn you that it might become dangerous.
Well, dangerous, sir, not lethal.
Yes. Yes, you are quite right.
I apologize, Mr. Pollock.
When one is willing to die for national honor, it is hard to remember that other people have equally important values to live for.
There is no reason why you, an outsider, should risk such a sacrifice for another man's country.
You... You take unfair advantage, Mr. Prime Minister.
How so?
By appealing to a man's better instincts.
- I was confident that you had them.
- Well... very well, sir.
Where would you like me to be...
murdered this time?
Try and find the inscription if you can.
Decipher it, and call me the moment you have.
- Time is getting very short and...
- David.
Thank God you're all right.
This isn't your house.
This is my house, and you weren't invited.
I didn't even know you were alive, but I came to warn you anyway.
About what?
Nejim's men are on their way here to get the cipher back.
- You've got to get away.
- Now slow down a minute.
Aren't you the same Miss Azir who just stood there while your friends tried to kill me?
Oh, David!
You don't think I enjoyed that?
- Well, so long as you didn't enjoy it.
- There was nothing I could do.
You've got to listen to me!
Every time I listen to you, someone either hits me over the head or tries to vaccinate me.
Maybe it's time that I called the police.
You mustn't do that.
What do you suggest then, the Salvation Army?
- Come with me, before it's too late.
- What? And wind up back in Yussef Kasim's rumble seat?
No, thank you.
Tell your boyfriend I'm a bad sport.
If I'd let him kill me, I'd never have forgiven myself.
Yussef is not my boyfriend.
I loathe him.
Of course you do.
You just do what he tells you because he's holding your family hostage back in the old country.
- How did you know that?
- Oh, come on.
I've seen that movie.
General Ali Ben Ali, the man he works for, threatened to kill my mother and sisters unless I cooperated with him.
And Beshraavi, who's he got, your Uncle Max from Newark?
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.
If you want to live with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, that's your business.
Do you think I like being near that degenerate?
I have to.
Don't you understand?
Yussef ordered me to meet him and to cultivate his friendship, so I could report on his actions.
Anyway, the pay is good.
It's not the money.
I swear it. It's my family.
Oh, look, everyone's got problems, including me, so I'd just as soon not get mixed up in yours.
But you are mixed up in them, whether you like it or not.
Beshraavi wants to rule our country with his money, General Ali with his guns.
Both must know what's in that inscription.
That means they need you.
David, you must believe that I hate them both, that I'm only doing what they want because I have to.
If you can translate the inscription and we can get it to my embassy, we'll both be safe.
Yeah, well, It sounds reasonable, I guess.
Then... you believe me?
In this cynical old world, you have to believe in something.
So, it might as well be you.
- OK, I'll buy it.
- Thank you.
Take it easy.
I'm not quite myself this morning.
You're wonderful.
Yeah, if I could find my head, I'd go get it examined.
If we're going to have visitors, we better get out of here.
Want to give it to me now?
- Give what to you?
- The inscription.
- I don't have it.
- Well, who does?
- You do.
- Me?
No, no.
You've forgotten, Yussef took it from me in the van last night.
But he couldn't find it.
Yeah, he found it.
He just didn't know that he'd found it.
Maybe we can still get it back...
with a little help from you.
Where's Yussef?
It's all right. He's down there.
OK, where is it?
Over there, I think.
Come on.
Must have had pups during the night.
I'll know it when I see it.
He dented it last week.
How?
Knocking down an old lady at a crossing?
There it is.
Hey, hey.
- It's still there.
- I don't see anything.
The candy!
You are brilliant!
The result of a clean mind and a healthy body.
Yussef.
I've checked all the morning papers.
There's not a word.
- Do you think he's still alive?
- Stop bugging me. How would I know?
Have you heard from the girl?
She'll give me a blast when she knows something.
Oh, no, he's taking it.
Why couldn't he be on a diet?
What do you know?
- Thirty-five.
Which one is it?
- Number nine.
- You were actually telling the truth.
- What do you mean?
Yussef was here. I was here.
The cipher was here.
All you had to do was yell, but you didn't.
That absurd story about your mother and sisters must be true.
- You mean you didn't believe me?
- Then why did you come with me?
- I didn't know where the van was.
Miss Azir, I humbly apologize.
I don't accept.
The least you can do when I tell you something is believe it.
With your track record?
Let's go.
Be ready to duck.
- Fourteen.
- I only hope his sweet tooth holds up.
We're victims of the Establishment.
Ask him to move.
It's no use. They can't move, speak or even listen. If they do, they're beheaded.
Oh, nonsense.
He's a man, isn't he?
- Excuse me, soldier.
- He's a guardsman.
Excuse me, guardsman.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I know you're on duty, but...
There is something under your foot that belongs to us.
OK?
Please.
Pretty please.
David, make him lift his foot!
You've been learning from Nejim.
Fifty-two!
You'd think after all that...
Oh, no.
He's found it.
Sink, sank, sunk.
- He must be calling Yussef.
- I don't think so.
He knows Yussef's number.
Keep an eye on Webster.
Look here.
Webster sold out to Nejim.
Seems to be a popular indoor sport these days.
You're not including me, I hope.
Of course not. We're believing you today.
- 3:30, but it doesn't say where.
- It doesn't have to.
If he's meeting Nejim at 3:30, there's only one place it can be.
In the fifth race the runners are as follows...
I must go and advise my horse.
- Are you coming, my love?
- You go, my darling.
I think I'll put some money on her.
What an excellent idea.
But only to win, of course.
It would be a grave mistake to back another horse at this late stage.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Dillingham.
By Jove, it's actually Lady Hetherington-Cartwright.
- Don't overdo it.
- I didn't know you could.
I haven't seen Webster.
He's handing the inscription to Sloane at 3:30 by the winning post.
- Do be a dear, Mr. Dillingworth.
- Ham.
Dillingham.
Tell me what you fancy for this race.
I'm putting my jolly old shirt on number nine.
Keep your eyes on the winning post.
You'll have to get it somehow.
- And then what?
- Meet at Trafalgar Square at midnight.
It's been positively smash to have bumped into you this way, old thing.
Do give my regards to your husband next visiting day.
- Ta-ta.
- Toodle-oo.
What odds did you get?
Two to one.
They're off.
It's Pollock.
They're turning into the stretch.
Three furlongs left to race, and it's...
That bungling idiot, Sloane.
Darling, we won!
- Hello?
- Prime Minister Jena, please.
It's very urgent.
This is Mr. Pollock.
Pollock.
Mr. Pollock, what has happened?
Mr. Jena, there's been some trouble.
- A man was killed at Ascot today.
- Yes, I heard.
Have you also heard who it is they think killed him?
Mrs. Pollock's idiot son, David, that's who.
I need your help.
I don't think there's anything I can do for you right now, besides suggesting that you stay clear of the police.
Mr. Prime Minister, I don't think I've made myself clear.
Right now I'm wanted for murder.
You're the only one who can explain what I've been doing.
But, Mr. Pollock, I thought I'd made myself clear.
For security reasons, I have never seen you.
I am not even in England.
Whatever the circumstances, we must disclaim any knowledge of you.
Where are you?
Have you the message?
If the message is not deciphered soon, then...
Come here, my darling.
- I brought you some presents.
- How sweet.
More shoes?
But, darling, you've already given me dozens.
I couldn't resist these.
Quite a coincidence, Mr. Pollock turning up at the right place and right time. - Don't you think so?
- I would hardly call it a coincidence.
Neither would I. How do you account for it, my flower?
He must have been following Yussef's man, the one who was killed.
- Do you think so?
- It's the only explanation.
You wouldn't have mentioned it, of course.
I?
Those are rather attractive, don't you think?
Exquisite.
I really must thank whoever was responsible for getting him there.
- Then you wanted him to have it?
- Certainly.
Who else is going to decipher it?
I want you to find him again,
I want you to stay with him until he finishes his work, and then I want you to bring the answers to me.
- Is that clear, my angel?
- Very clear.
I know that I can trust you to do that for me.
Unless, of course, you're growing weary of my little gifts.
Oh, and if I don't hear from you by noon tomorrow try and think of some remote corner of the world where I won't find you.
I don't think you can... but try.
Thank you, sir.
- Mrs. Ragheeb?
- Oh, but, sir...
I must speak to Mrs. Ragheeb.
Mrs. Ragheeb, I'm an associate of Professor Ragheeb at Oxford.
This is tremendously urgent.
It's about your husband's... murder.
Murder?
Why do you say "murder"?
Your husband was murdered by some agent of Nejim Beshraavi.
He was killed for a Hittite inscription.
I don't know why.
- I know very little, but I know that.
- No, Amir.
Mrs. Ragheeb, I know this is a terrible time to trouble you, but I've got to know what that inscription means.
I thought, perhaps, among your husband's notes...
- A Hittite inscription, you say?
- Did he tell you anything about it?
Show it to me.
Mrs. Ragheeb...
I told him he was mad to meddle in such things.
Madness and suicide.
And now... he's in there.
But he must have told you something. He must have mentioned where he got it, who gave it to him.
- We have to know.
- "We"?
Who else?
A girl.
Her family's in great danger.
Her mother and sisters, General Ali will kill them.
- Is the girl named Yasmin Azir?
- Yes.
And she told you that her mother and her sisters are in danger?
Yes.
Yasmin has no such family, Mr. Pollock.
There is only her father.
General Ali would never harm him.
- Why not?
- Because General Ali is her father.
David, I was so worried about you.
Oh, you were?
The police think you killed Webster.
Have you seen the papers?
I don't care what they say as long as they spell my name right.
I had a hard time convincing Nejim I had nothing to do with your being at Ascot.
I'm sure that you were very convincing.
I told him you must have been following Webster, - but I'm not sure he believed me.
- How could anyone not believe you?
He made me promise to keep you working on the cipher and to call him the moment you've broken it.
- Oh, damn.
- What's wrong?
Nejim had me followed when I left the house but I thought I'd lost them.
Now they're back again.
Oh, it's all right. We lost them.
Next time let me know so I can fasten my seat belt.
Where is the inscription?
May I see it?
Why do you want to see it?
I don't know.
I've never seen it.
When you've seen one, you've seen them all.
- As long as you have it.
- Well, I don't have it.
- What do you mean?
Of course you have it!
- Look out!
- Would you like me to drive?
- What have you done with it?
Relax. I haven't forgotten your mother and sisters.
- I mailed it to myself.
- Oh, no.
How will you be able to work on it?
I won't have to. I know what's in it.
What does it mean?
Tell me.
It said, "The... plague shall not pass until the swans... fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."
- Vesta?
What does that mean?
- How should I know?
My job was to translate it into English.
Well, I suppose it will mean something to somebody.
I'll call the embassy and tell them, but I'd better drop you off first.
- Where are you staying?
- Right here with you.
It's not safe for you to be out on the streets.
What if the police stop us?
The way you drive? Why should they stop us?
All right, David.
I'll look for a phone box.
No, no, I'll look. That way maybe we can keep from hitting it.
- Want me to come with you?
- What for?
- Think how cozy it would be.
- But so hard to dial.
Don't tell me that the ambassador spoke with you at this hour?
As a matter of fact, he did.
They are preparing for Mr. Jena's visit tomorrow.
What did he say?
He didn't understand the message.
He said to come right over.
Er... it's all right. You can get out here.
I'll meet you later.
- Why?
- Stop asking so many questions.
There are police at the embassy.
They'll recognize you.
Do you want to be arrested for murder?
All right.
I'll meet you in Knightsbridge at the Kelly Hotel.
I'm registered in the name of O'Malley.
- O'Malley?
- There's a discount if you're Irish.
Follow that car.
All my life I've waited for somebody to say that.
Thanks, guv.
I enjoyed that.
Yussef?
Yasmin!
Get down!
- David, you followed me.
- No, I didn't.
You went to the embassy and I came here to my hotel.
There.
Over the wall.
Wait!
Down here.
Can't say I care much for your embassy.
David, I wasn't deceiving you.
I had to find out what the message means.
Yussef is the only one who knows.
That's why I came here.
Not one of your brighter ideas.
- You stay here.
- David!
Oh, David! Oh, David!
I couldn't let you die without hearing the end of your story. Come on!
But it's true. Everything.
I swear it.
As true as your poor old mother and your three sisters?
- Of course.
- I went to Mrs. Ragheeb.
- Oh, no.
- She was very well-informed about you.
You told her you and I were working together?
- Naturally.
- No wonder.
No wonder what?
She'd say anything to keep you from trusting me.
She's an agent of Yussef's, like her husband.
Don't you see what you did?
The moment you let her know I was double-crossing them, she called Yussef to warn him.
So he lured me to the construction site, to kill me!
What is there about you that makes you so hard to believe?
Perhaps it's because I'm such a terrible liar.
But never with you, of course.
I wish I could say the same.
"The plague shall not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."
You made it up?
- What's the real message?
- I haven't worked it out yet.
We'll have to do something.
I packed a suitcase. It's in the back.
I can't very well go back to my house.
Nejim isn't the understanding type.
Haven't you any ideas?
Yeah.
Darling?
I got the message.
Yasmin!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning, my darling.
You pass bachelor's requirement number one. You're lovely in the morning.
I was dreaming of someone much more romantic.
You.
No, come back here.
I have something else.
I've cracked the cipher.
David, that's wonderful.
What does it mean?
It's a phony, 100 per cent phony.
It isn't Hittite.
It's an ordinary, common-or-garden grade-school code.
- Look.
Here, you want these?
- No, certainly not.
You see, bird sign, bird sign, bird sign.
Sex differentiation factor.
You mean it's dirty?
No, a three-year-old child could understand.
Female bird: goose. Female bird: goose.
Male bird: gander.
"Whither do you wender..."
- No, that's "wander". - Wander.
- "Upstairs, downstairs..." - "Or in my lady's chamber."
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
We've got Beshraavi, the British constabulary, the whole human race howling after our blood just for a lousy nursery rhyme.
- It's got to mean something.
- It must.
- Who wrote it in the first place?
- Ragheeb, I imagine.
Exactly.
Ragheeb.
"Upstairs, downstairs...
in my lady's chamber."
Mrs. Ragheeb must have the answer.
She couldn't have. She would have told Yussef.
That's right too.
When I showed her a copy of it, she tore it up.
She looked at it, and she didn't give a damn.
- David... what are you talking about?
A copy of the message means nothing, the translation means nothing.
The message is a screen.
It's a doodle.
All that matters is the original piece of paper.
- The original?
- Of course. It isn't the cipher.
It's something else on that paper. Something underneath the cipher.
Arise, arise, oh, my beloved.
To the Hammersmith Post Office.
Have you got it?
Don't you trust me with anything?
No watermark.
- What do you see?
- Gander, goosy, goosy.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
It must be here someplace.
Are you burning it?
That's how you detect invisible ink.
- Weren't you ever in the Boy Scouts?
- I flunked the physical.
You should have tried my troop.
We'd have waived it.
Wait, wait!
Stop the car!
- What are you doing?
- I'm about to invent the wheel.
Well, there it goes.
- No, no, wait.
Look!
- I don't see anything.
The eye. The eye of the third bird.
What's that?
A microdot.
- What do you see?
- Take a look.
- She's a beauty, isn't she?
- She certainly is.
But the microscope's a trifle small.
Haven't you anything larger?
Certainly, sir.
So that's what they wanted Yussef to know.
Something on this order, sir?
I'm afraid not.
Haven't you anything larger?
I'll look, sir.
What do we do now?
It says when, but it doesn't say where.
When is the 18th?
Monday was the 14th.
Tuesday, Wednesday...
- It's today. - Today?
Come on!
This is the largest we have, sir. Shall I...
Hey, David, look!
- Oh, no! Do something!
- Lift it out of the way?
I don't care. Do anything!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Jena will be happy to answer your questions now.
All right, mate. Lots of room.
That's it.
Keep on going.
Lots of leeway back there.
Bring her on back, mate.
OK, fine. Plenty of leeway.
Plenty of leeway.
Lots of room.
Right on back.
Good.
Right on back, mate. Right on back.
Fine, fine.
Good. Plenty of room, mate.
That's good.
Thanks, mate.
This is your first visit to England.
What are your first impressions?
We could use some of your English rain in our dry country.
In our country, there's a great deal of oil and very little water.
A highly inflammable situation.
All right, Hemsley.
Water remains our most serious problem.
To paraphrase Marie Antoinette: I can hardly say of my people, "Let them drink oil."
May I see your press card, please, sir?
Diners Club?
I'm afraid I don't recognize you.
We're doing a piece on the Arabic cuisine.
- I'm sorry, sir. It's not on my list.
- Get out of the way.
I'm sorry, sir.
Would you comment on the treaty you intend signing?
You've been misinformed, sir.
I shall not sign the treaty.
- Listen!
- Let us through!
- He's about to be killed!
- I hardly think so, this is England.
I have studied the terms of the treaty most carefully, and I could not, in good conscience...
They have fought too long and hard...
Please!
Let us through, please!
What is happening?
- Mr. Pollock?
- I'm sorry, sir.
Are you all right?
It appears that I am.
What happened?
I was a little late deciphering the message. That's what.
- Here. Let me help you up.
- Thank you.
Mr. Pollock was brilliant.
He deserves a medal.
Who is responsible for this?
Do you know?
Yes, sir.
Nejim Beshraavi.
Beshr...
Mr. Pollock, I must speak with you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Come, Mr. Prime Minister.
The car is waiting.
- I must speak with Mr. Pollock.
- There's no time.
We don't know who else here might be involved.
I must speak to Mr. Pollock!
Come on.
They did it.
After all that, they did it. We just stood there.
- Where are we going?
- We have to find Jena.
- Did I understand you to say...
- That wasn't Jena.
- It sounded like you said...
- I tell you, it wasn't!
It looked very much like him, but it wasn't Jena.
It was Hassan Jena.
I know him.
- Oh! - He knows me.
I've spoken to him many times.
He came to Oxford.
Jena's never set foot in England before today.
He wanted people to think that.
He was here.
He's the one who sent me to Beshraavi in the first place.
That man? The one who was shot?
Yes. Now do you believe me?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I never knew who you were.
That's why he looked so frightened.
Nejim hired him to impersonate Jena, only he neglected to mention that part of his job was to be murdered.
We have to find the real Jena.
Come on.
You expect me to believe that nonsense?
- What proof do you have?
- He didn't recognize me.
But... Wait...
Why should he recognize you?
Yasmin, are you trying to tell me something?
I am a spy.
Hey. Wait!
- Can you prove that statement?
- Do you think we carry calling cards?
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't have believed me.
- Where are we going?
- I want to see where it happened.
Where what happened?
Did you record the Prime Minister's arrival on tape?
- Yes.
- Run it for me.
The Prime Minister's life may depend on it.
- You're a bit late.
He's been shot.
- Do as I say.
- Is that tape ready to roll yet?
- It's all set.
Put it up on the monitors.
- Which one is that?
- The real one.
It has to be.
There was no way to get to him before this.
Yes, it's Jena.
Those are his favorite slippers.
Can you see what's happening inside the car?
The windows are too dark.
Hold that. Can you freeze it?
Look, the shoes are different.
He's not wearing slippers anymore.
That's where it happened. In the car.
We've got to find it.
She's a government spy.
Look.
Come on.
Give me a hand, will you?
You seriously think...
What else would they have done?
Left him in the airport?
It's the treaty, isn't it?
If it had gone through, Nejim would have been ruined.
- Jena was going to sign it?
- That's why they needed a substitute.
To denounce the treaty before the assassination.
I have a vivid imagination.
I must say, I never saw myself unpacking a prime minister.
Our life expectancy may be nil, but I'd like you to know this has been a very real, warm, human experience.
It's uncanny.
What is it? Where am...
You're among friends, sir.
At least for the next 30 seconds.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
- Is that you, Miss Azir?
- Let's get him out.
Ploy number one.
We've got him, sir.
It's about time you did something right.
Well, get him out!
Hey, you two! Lend a hand here.
And you!
Undo these chains.
Put it down!
Open it, Sloane.
Imbecile.
Must you mismanage everything?
Down!
Flat! Now!
Come on!
Run for it!
Wait!
- Can you ride, Mr. Prime Minister?
- You ask that of an Arab?
- What do you want?
- We, er... er...
You can't ride in that skirt.
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
That way!
I don't see what he can do now.
He'll think of something.
I knew you couldn't keep a good man down.
There!
Get them, Sloane!
This time get them!
David!
- Are you all right?
- No. I'm ashamed of myself.
- I ride better than that.
- Come on!
This side!
Those stairs must lead somewhere.
Are you sure?
If they don't, watch out for the last one.
Here comes old Eagle-Eye.
This is like a recurring dream I used to have.
- How did it end?
- Don't ask.
Here goes.
Don't, David.
Please, don't. You'll be a sitting duck.
How come my recurring dream never ended this way?
I don't know.
Mine always did.
I guess I just travel in better dreams.
Do I have your... solemn pledge that you'll never spy again?
- Only on you.
- Oh, swell.
Hey!
You clumsy idiot!
Oh, it's you, Mr. Pollock.
Oh, hello, Fanshaw.
David... you can swim, can't you?
Sorry.
Not a stroke.
David!
Here we are again, taking a bath together.
David, you lied to me!
Sure.
It was my turn.
[Brancaleone = Lioncatcher]
No, no, please.
No, no, no.
- Let me go, let me go. - Hold on.
That's it. I'm leavin'.
Let me go, let me go.
This armour is mine.
Get out.
- No.
- Hey, you, trader!
- Abacuc. - Somebody helps me, help.
I'm going to hide myself. They are thieves.
They are going to take all! Poor me!
- Open up, Abacuc. - Open up!
- We got something to sell to you. - Open up or else we'll burn you.
- Get it up. - No, let's throw him into the river.
- Let's go.
- Hey, you, get it up.
- Where are you taking me to? - Open up or we're gonna drown you.
Gosh, this is damn heavy!
Open it, open it. - Ah! He's finally decided!
- What's going on, what's this about? - What do you want? - I'll show what's good for you.
- What a staff, ah?
- Look at this sword, the steel's great.
- Let me get out of here first. - Good stuff, the best.
Get out, come on. Look at this armor, Abacuc.
The armor of a great warrior.
- First I touch it, then I pay it. - Look at this.
What a thing! Everything's spoiled. - It's the best!
How come it's spoiled? - Who's gonna buy this staff?
- It's a big deal.
The stingy old man.
What's this?
- What's written there? - Good Lord, do you know who you... - Stole these weapons and clothes from?
- Arnolf Iron-Hand. - Who is he?
Prince's Otoni Fighter vassal, a great Lord of Saxon... damn it, I wish I've never seen you before.
I've killed him.
- Have you? - Yes, he's dead.
- Are you sure? - Of course. Well, so, we'll have a good deal, I'm gonna read it to you, right?
We concede to the owner of this parchment the possession of the... Aurocastro Fortress in Puglia, and the vineyards, the cattle, and... all the riches in there.
The Feudal Lord has to make a sacred vow... to rule the city through wisdom vanishing with the terrible... danger that comes from the seas, with the winds of springs... when... when... when...
hold on.
But, what danger?
A piece is missing.
But this can worth it about a hundred grand... - How?
- Selling it. - Selling it? - To a Knight.
He, with this... parchment, goes to the Fortress and will take it for real.
Let's go find a Lord, and let's not sell the parchment.
We're gonna take possession of the land.
He'll be the head and we, the soldiers. Before he'll swear that he'll divide everything with us. - That's it.
So, he needs to be a haughty Knight, good looking, but hungry for... goods and for lands, yes, Knight out of money...
- And in rags like ourselves. - Definitely.
- I know one like that.
Let's go to Civita, there'll be a tournament for all the Knights there.
Aquilante?
Aquilante, damn you!
Come here, I'm gonna give you some sugar, come here.
There you are, you stupid horse.
Now, I'll catch you.
Damn it! Come here, you damn thing!
Come, come here, sweety.
Come here, sugar, I'll give you a reward.
- Here's your bar of sugar. - Is that the one you got?
Gentleman, we've a good bargain for you.
We, ah... Otoni, known as The Fighter, for God's will... Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Lord of Saxon...
Duke of Battenburg and of Pomerania, concedes to the owner... of this parchment... the possession of this City and of the Fortress... of Aurocastro in Puglia, with the vineyards, the cattle... and all the riches in there.
The Feudal Lord has to make a sublime vow... to rule the city through wisdom and eliminating, etc... etc.
We received this parchment from a great and noble Knight... that gave it to us when he was dying.
Now, we offer you, brave and spotless Knight... And broke. ...the luck of being the owner of a wealthy land, and of the Fortress of...
In change, you'll make a sublime swear of dividing... all the riches and all the goods, with all of us.
- Do you know who I am?
- No! I supposed you've heard the name Spanker Le Fugitive. I've never heard it before.
Spanker Le Fugitive. The biggest captain of Tuscia.
And I'm the one who at a stroke of axe have cut him in two. My name, pay attention, my name is Brancaleone, from Norcia.
Ulrich, the landlord of this land, offers to the winner of this... tournament the title of Captain of... the Weapons and offers his daughter Lucrezia as bride, too.
Consider that Brancaleone from Norcia, has already on his hands the title... and the wealthy marriage.
So, get out of here, you insignificant. You and your miserable feudal of Puglia.
The vineyards, cattle and the sea full of fishes to be divided in a half.
Besides, put this into your mind, old man.
Brancaleone from Norcia... has never shared anything with anybody.
Come on, stupid animal.
Take part in this tournament the Knights:
Wizard Peacock... cadet of Petralla, Marald of the Sutri, Marcone tyrant of...
The first contest is Griphon, commonly known as Dirty-Hand... vs. Brancaleone from Norcia.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Go ahead. - It's that way! - Stop it.
Stop it.
Come back, don't run away.
Gosh!
You betrayer. - Coward.
- It's not my fault, it's the bloody animal . - Stop it.
Go ahead.
- I'll cut your ears.
Coward, don't run, stop and fight.
Where is that Feudal?
The man at my service is not afraid neither of the rain nor of the sun... - The fire or the wind. - What service?
We are all equal. Silence here. I'm the commander.
Our path will be... covered by sweat, tears and blood.
Are you ready for that? - Everybody at the same time. - Yes.
We'll set off for days, weeks and months, but... at the end, we'll have castles, treasures and white women... with big teats.
Taccone, stand up the flags.
- I have no flags. - Good! Stand them up very high.
And you villain, put yourselves under its shadow... get out of the mud, I'll turn the five of you a speed army and... - Commander, we are in four.
- I'll turn the four of you a... speed army, brave that's gonna be a greyhound and a lion at the same time.
Let's go ahead, on the way to Aurocastro just in the heart of Puglia.
Go ahead my hero fellows.
Go, go.
Follow me.
Get out of my way.
You get out.
No, you must to get out. I'm a Knight.
What about me? You've seen my army.
Don't you have eyes?
- As much as you have a tongue.
- So, what is missing is your brain.
My name is Brancaleone from Norcia.
From the family Bysantine descendent of Bicephalus I, as I see you...
Taccone.
- Truce.
- Axe.
I said, axe.
- Look out!
That's it. - That's it. - Truce!
It was the only one.
Ouch! - It's the spleen... yes.
No...
It's the liver... in there.
- Yes? - Yes. It always hurts me.
Boil some alfalfa... chicory... brimstone, mallow, citron-tree, and boil them all... and... drink it all.
- Is it a good medicine? - Yeah! It's gonna be inside you giving kicks till everything is clean, then... then a bit fire gets out from behind.
And you're cured. Hey, you there? Night's coming!
That's the Hebrew Abacuc, he is in charge of the treasures of the army... and he is a great trader, he is at my service.
I have an idea. Though you sound pompous, all of you seem to be... in rags.
My family is very rich... and would pay a lot for my life.
So, I thought, if I offered myself as a prisoner and go to my... father's Castle to demand a ransom in gold, that is gonna be half and half.
- And then, each one for himself, right?
- And where is this Castle? Very far, there.
No, there, where the sun's down.
- But, don't we have to go to Aurocastro?
- No way, Aurocastro can wait... for a while we're going to get our gold, hurry up, let's go.
Hurry up? Who are you? Capricious of Velletri.
- We'll go to where I tell you to... We'll leave and we'll take possession of our feudal, according to the... parchment.
All of you need to act with dignity... obedience, decency and submission... but where is the look of the man who keeps the weapons?
Out with all... this trash, out with the hanging rags... and with all these old staffs and with the tents.
Discipline!
Wait, wait for me.
My horse ran away.
- Wait, I'll go with you.
- What for? I'm your prisoner, I've got to follow you.
Listen, you're free, just take another way and don't disturb us anymore.
The hardhead Bizantine continues on following us.
- What village is that?
- For sure it's, San Cimone or...
Bagnarolo... or even Panzanatico or... another place that I don't know.
Keep in line. Quiet!
This silence doesn't make me feel good.
Let's go very carefully.
- Who's behind us? - Slow.
What a tomb silence! And corpse stink!
Did they run away from us?
All the villains escape when they see armed soldiers. Well, that's it.
By the right of the winner, take everything... you can, hurry up to get to Aurocastro well dressed, go!
- Go. - Count on me, let's go. - Everybody to the cellar.
- We're gonna to devastate this village.
My army will leave its terrible signal.
Dura lex, sed lex.
- Cucurucu.
Let's enjoy the life, to sin, what's the death?
What's left for us from life?
Give it a bite.
Let me kiss you.
No! No!
Where are you going?
Surrender to me, take me.
Surrender to me.
Cucurucu, cucurucu.
Cucurucu. Surrender, take me.
Your skin is on fire.
Love fever? !
I've got it, too.
- No, not that bed.
- Why not?
- Surrender, take, cucurucu.
- My husband died in it.
- Died? When?
- Yesterday.
- The disease that reaches everyone.
The Black Death.
Let's get out of here.
Let's run.
Help. The Black Death! - The Black Death!
- Let's leave this place. Come on. - Run, let's run.
- We're lost, lost.
Come on, let's follow Aquilante, he's an expert in running away.
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- Don't spoil the safe. - It'll be our last suit!
Come on, let's go. Damned village.
Let's go. - Come on. - Not so fast.
- What a bad eating we've done.
- Run, old man. - Get some wings, old man.
- The safe is gonna break.
You're gonna spoil it. Oh!
Good Lord! Hold on.
Hold on, brothers.
Abacuc, Pecoro, Aquilante...
Hold on... it doesn't help to run, the death, death's already in all of us.
Hey...
It's true. You didn't get into the village.
- You didn't want me to.
- You knew about the Black Death.
- And didn't say a word about it. - Stay there.
- Be aware or I'll make a hole on you. - Bizantine worm.
- We contracted the pestilence, and you laugh.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna infect you. - No, no, no. Spit on him!
Spit! Don't let him go.
Catch him.
Hold him, let's transmit the disease to him.
Slap him, slap him.
No!
Stop it, Christians.
You don't want to suffer the same way we are...
Fortunate men, I bring you the salvation...
Join us and save your lives. Follow me and the terrible harm... won't get you. Take your weapons and come with me to the Holy...
Land to get the Saint Sepulcher free...
I promise you that you'll have your body and soul saved. Who purifies the... impure will be pure.
Who goes with me to the Holy Land will be cured.
Come on, soldiers of faith, form with me a happy squad.
Everybody to the Holy, Holy Tomb.
Deus vult! God wants it!
From every harm will be cured who goes with me to the Holy Land.
- I go.
- Before let's ask for a guarantee in...
- A paper that there is cure for all.
- What do you say, son of Judas?
- What about Aurocastro? - We'll never get there.
What do you prefer, brothers, right death by pest, or what the monk... promised us?
It will be the salvation of the life in the Holy Land.
Let's go.
Let's go, brothers.
Fill your hearts, come on.
Come you too, Aquilante.
- Why are you here?
- I've got the gout and sand on my teeth.
The good monk guaranteed me health, then we're going to Taranto where... there's an army and many boats, we're going to Jerusalem to fight...
- That's it... we'll fight one a one against the black people in the Holy Land, and what... about you, my friend, what do you have?
What battle did you lose the arm?
- In Battilonta? Or against the Swebians?
- In his house, he found me... with his woman, and just because of it he cut my arm. - Ah!
- After that, we've become... friends, we've left the swine both of us have left... with the monk Zenone to the Holy Lands.
- I see. - And I carry on this huge stone...
- For a bigger punishment.
- All right, let's all go fight... everybody to the Holy Lands.
What about you, my good man, why are you with us?
- He is leprous.
- It's disgusting.
Hold on! Make lines.
One after the other.
Cross on Longobardic line.
- Monk Zenone, it doesn't seem safety!
- Men of a little faith...
How can you be afraid of the bridge, if the hand of God is holding it?
Remember Thomas, the incredulous apostle.
Let's remember him and cross it. Come on, you cowards.
You, Abacuc, who weights a few pounds, will be the first one to cross it.
- Go, go, go.
- Trust. - Go on Longobardic line.
- Go, come on. The hands of God hold you.
Go through and remember Thomas...
Follow me, come on.
- Don't be afraid. - Put your faith on the bridge.
- I'm here with you.
- Go ahead, come on.
Let's sing!
The way is so big as much as... - The goal. - Big.
Man of a little faith.
God took His hand away.
But why did he take His hand away?
Do you know? - No, Priest.
We don't know.
- 'Cause among us there're some impure...
Someone here has no faith...
Who has no faith?
- No, everybody has faith.
- Almost everybody. That one, that one.
- What? Who are you talking about?
- I have my faith. - Of course, he has. - He has his own faith.
- We are all friends. - Right, we are all friends. - Horror!
By the way, are you an heretic? - No! I'm a Jewish.
There was a serpent among us!
That's the reason of our disgrace. Let's baptize him.
Let's baptize him, an impure.
It'll be pure who purifies an impure. Let's go to the waters, to the waters, of the salvation!
Let's go to the bath.
- For the purification.
- Calm down, Abacuc.
- Come on, Abacuc, come on. - Take it easy.
Today is Saint Mansueto's day, and your name will be Mansueto.
Get up warrior pilgrims, why to sleep when it's time... to thank the Lord?
thank to the Lord, that makes the way to salvation, full of... obstacles.
But, how can you fight in the Holy Lands... if you don't have the faith to cross a bridge?
What are you afraid of?
Now, we're pure.
There's no danger... - Because the heretic was purified. - So, he goes first.
Cowards! Cowards, cowards.
Sing and cross, I'll give you and example, the bridge is firm.
Look!
Look!
Deus vult.
That's the way God wants. Look!
Where are you going, Father?
- What a flight, ah?
- Yeah, rest in peace.
- And, what to do now? - Well, let's go back.
- But, what about the pestilence? - We're pure. The monk said it.
- He vanished. - Who gave, gave. Who had, had.
did you forget the vows? We'll go back to the Holy Land.
That's what God wants. Peace, peace!
He is right, that's it.
We're free of the vow.
And if from each fact we should extract the meaning... here it is.
God doesn't want.
Deus non vult. It's clear.
- No, he wants. - No, He doesn't want.
Let's go back to our path, come on, straight ahead to Auro... don't mention the place.
Or else they will follow us. You are right, yeah. Well, fellows...
On the road, let's go. - Let's go. Let's go.
Each one for himself.
- Where are you going to?
- No where, exactly. - Let's go together.
Soldiers, come here, hurry up.
Help me.
Let me go. Help me.
- Follow me, my warriors.
- My Holy Mother, help me.
Look, when I say, follow me, my warriors... what you have to do is follow me and fight.
Thank you, my hero. Thank you.
- Are you a Knight? - Of course I am.
This is my pupil Matelda, she is gonna marry a noble... the Duke Guccione of Nuts-Frog, if you are a Knight of Sword... you must know the code of honour...
I leave my little girl to you to take care, be her father and her mother... her baby-sitter and her sister, her shield and her support... take care of her life, and at most take care of her pureness.
Make a swear.
The sword, give me my sword.
He is feeling bad, isn't he?
- Christians, Aren't we going to Aurocastro anymore?
- It's the same way. - No, it's 4 days more on the road. Take the girl to her future husband.
- I'll give you a good reward. - How much? How much?
A hundred coins of gold. - What about 150?
- Abacuc, in front of the death?
All right.
And where is our gold?
- In a secret place.
- There's a secret place.
- And where, where, where is the place?
Come on, get it up, get it up.
- Oh! Tutor, Tutor. No!
Carefully, little Christians.
Carefully. - Leave!
- No, go down slowly.
Come on quick.
Ah?
Did it arrive, ha? - Yeah.
It arrived.
- There we go.
The girl.
I'm scared.
Come with me.
Get it up. Come on.
Hold tightly.
- Going down.
- Slowly. Go it down.
Slowly. Slowly. Close to you I feel safety.
I wonder if it will be this way with my future husband? Ah? What do you think?
This... this guy Guccione, how is he, ah?
Is he... is he blond?
Or brown? - Or what?
- I don't know him.
The husband who I've dreamed about has to be... tall, strong, a good looking, like you.
What's the matter with you, Knight?
I can feel your heart beating a lot.
- Stop it.
- The rope twisted, make something.
What can I do?
- Don't be afraid.
- No, I'm not afraid.
I take care of it.
Courage, you can jump.
My father, the Baron of Norcia, died when I was nine years old.
My mother got married again, married to a perverse man... who, eager for my treasures, gave me to his foreman... that knew how to use a knife very well, to kill me.
But he didn't do it, he had pity on me and abandoned me in the forest... where I could survive myself.
And where I grew up free and strong like a greyhound.
When I was 20 years old I went to the castle to claim for what was mine... however, my mother and my step-father were dead... after having spoiled all the goods.
And when I said, I'm Brancaleone, the unique legitimate heir... of everything that they left to me, the Policy Captain shouted:
So... you'll pay the debts.
Then, I took the sword, I hurt two of the officers and I had to run.
Cover yourself.
What are you doing?
- Crooked ones, what are you looking at?
- Why? Can't we look? - No.
- No, don't look, no. - Ah! Let's look, yeah.
Aurocastro, at least she can amuse us.
- Besides, get out of my sight. - You Pilatos of Bysantium how dare you?
- Go back to the lines.
- They are claiming because... you're getting far away from Aurocasto to take me to Nuts-Frog. They are soldiers, they claim, but accept my hard discipline.
- But they are full of right.
- What did you say?
You must get back to your way.
What about you?
I'm coming with you.
If you want me, I'll come.
We'll have great kids for the new lineage of the Brancaleones.
I'll be your faithful wife and you, a husband deep in love because...
I'll give you my pureness.
I will. Tamelda!
Matelda!
I beg you, don't tempt me, I gave my word.
Don't take me to Guccione, I don't want him.
I want you.
Me, your little sheep, catch me, lion. - No, no.
- Nobody will have me, then. Catch the girl.
Matelda? Matelda, wait.
Matelda. Stop, Aquilante. It's an order.
- Why don't you get some sleep?
- I'm not sleepy.
- Tomorrow you are not gonna sleep.
You'll be given to Guccione tomorrow.
The brides make the night a day.
- I didn't want Guccione.
- Ah? And didn't he want you?
That damned stupid.
He swore to keep you pure.
But I want to break it.
Tonight. Matelda!
Matel... but...
Weren't you in a hurry to take me to Guccione?
Well, I'm ready. You sleep too much, come on, hurry up.
Move, you lazy horse, you got just one minute.
Look, over there.
- Cheers. - Cheers. - But, why have we stopped in here?
We've to go right to the point.
Guccione invited us to the wedding.
- I couldn't say no.
- Get my advice.
Eat something to get your strength back.
Guccione is an obscene man. And he'll be the first guy to catch...
- That flower.
- Maybe he's not the first one.
- What did you say?
Maybe you are right, but what could I do?
We could get the road, pick up our things and leave.
But, why the rush?
Have a drink. Let's go, my sweet wife.
- Take my advice, let's go now. - It wouldn't be correct.
- Isn't it time to stop drinking?
- I want to drink to forget.
Do you want a fruit? Hey? I'm talking to you.
Did you get nuts?
They went to the nuptial room, the party is over, let's go.
It's over?
The harm caused by love, it's just cured by another one.
Devil, what do you want to do now?
You want me to eat you, ah? You'd like to taste me. Right?
Taccone, throw me another fruit.
Are you ready?
Look, I'm gonna eat you. It's good!
But not in front of everybody.
Let's go upstairs... there is a room there just for us.
- Let's go. - I go.
The whole thing's starting.
Hold on everyone.
Tell me who did it?
- Who did what?
I want to know who did it.
- Him.
- No!
I swear to God.
How can you say such a perverse thing... of the man that suffered so much to keep his word?
- Catch him. - Come on, my hero fellows...
Damned!
Is it a painting?
Go back, you damned.
Army, over here.
Oh! Look out, I'm here. Oh!
Mercy, don't hurt me! Brancaleone, over here!
Come on, my soldiers.
Ah!
Help! Help!
Don't hurt me. Let me go.
And what about our coins of gold that are with you?
Get out of here. The money was given to you for what... you haven't done.
So, we've confiscated them all.
And you are... lucky not to be killed.
Get out, or else you'll turn like your... commander.
As an example for all, he'll stay in a cage... for days, weeks, months, till he's devoured by crows and falcons.
Get out of here, and don't come back.
Hey, commander, we are here.
Come on. Very good.
You're loyal. It's a merit.
- Do you know anything about Matelda?
I hope she's dead. - Take me out of here, come on.
- Let's see what we can do...
Go... come on, help the old man.
Hey!
No... don't put your hand. It's gonna fall down, take your hands off!
What a shot!
Damned shot.
Open up. Come on. - They can bite.
- Sure. Let's go to the trench. - Let's cross the trench.
- Come on, come on.
- Is it bottom? - No, it's shallow, you can... - Cross it.
Where is the forger?
- Why do you want a forger?
- To open a cage. A job? He is on the bridge, but go fast.
- One, one and a half, two, two and a...
- Hold on, hold on, Forger.
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone. - Hold him.
- I caught him.
- That's ok. I'll hold him.
I wanna die.
- She's cheated me.
- Hold him, don't let him go.
I wanna die.
- My wife ran away... with a soldier.
She's cheated me. I want to kill myself. We made it.
- Are you thinking of her?
- Who else could it be?
- Take it, it's soft. - Go back, you apostate!
Why did she do that?
It wasn't me that abused of her.
You shouldn't do that, when the woman offers herself, it's dangerous to say no.
- She gets a revenge.
- I couldn't have her... she was pure like a dove !
Of course she said yes to the to the tricks of a villain. If I put my hands on him, I swear to God.
He only did what you must have done, if you were an expert about woman.
I gave my word to keep her pure.
Brancaleone from Norcia will never injure a virgin.
- Virgin, she? !
Maybe a whore. - How dare you?
Bizantine worm.
Liar. Dirty snake.
Cynical detractor.
I'm gonna spank you. I'm gonna catch you.
Wait till I catch you, ouch, ouch.
Filthy boot!
Oh, shit, not again.
This is the cage, open it up, fast 'cause we have to leave.
Hold this.
I hope we go, without stopping, to Aurocastro.
I can't wait to get there, to lay on a very soft place.
Do you think we'll have servants to do the things for us there? Servants?
Servants and more servants.
What are we waiting for, let's get to the Fortress, I'm an old man... and I'm always in pain.
I need to get some good sleep, good food, a good drink and stay... - Doing nothing. - Yeah.
- Where are you going to?
- To the land of pleasure.
We're happy soldiers of the noble Knight. Glorious Commander... - And a fabulous hero.
Come with us, too. - When does he arrive, when?
- Who?
- The noble Knight.
The commander, the fabulous hero?
It's him.
What are you doing?
- Come back, where are you going?
- To the river, to the river.
- Don't be a moron. - Leave me.
Asshole. Ask me to forgive you, you son of a snake.
Are you mad at me? It's all because of that dirty Matelda.
A thousand times cursed.
Matelda was the last word that you... spelt in your life.
Take!
I'll kill you.
What's this about? For Matelda?
Are they fighting for her?
Hey?
- You don't need to kill each other.
- What do you mean? - I saw Matelda today. She was crying.
- Where did you see her?
In a car escorted by soldiers of the Duke Guccione.
She was going to a... - Convent for the rest of her life.
- Aquilante. To the convent...
Fast like a lightning.
Damned stirrup!
Matelda?
Matelda?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Matelda. Matelda?
I'm here.
I'm here, and so kind that I say to you... come with me.
I don't want to know who was the villain that abused of you.
Come with me, let's start our lives again. We'll have great kids, everything as you wanted. - No.
- I didn't understand the meaning...
- Of the last word.
- Too late.
I have now a very different husband.
What are you talking about?
I know I was very bad with you.
And I'm here to atone for what I did.
But now, I only can love Him... - Forgive me, good-bye.
- Matelda?
Matelda, come with me, or else I...
Will kill me?
You can do that, my mission will finish earlier.
Cut my head off.
How do you feel, milord?
Your Lord, my dear, suffered a hard stroke.
He met his great love on the dangerous way of weapons. He had to resign to keep his word. You know my dear, what happened then?
The pain... that my heart had to hold up.
Now your commander, says to his doctrine, do you know what's in this... world the reward for the human sacrifice?
A kick in the ass.
From now on I'll be called The Bitter Knight.
Or something like that.
You too? !
- Where are you going? - This way. - No, this way.
- The wind comes from here.
- What does that mean? - Nothing.
- Do you know where we are?
Beyond the forest is my castle. And I offer you again...
I pretend I'm your prisoner and ask to my father the ransom in gold.
That's it, so, we can buy clothes, weapons and some horses. - Let's go scoria. - That's okay, Ostrogote.
Down there, there is current water, we're gonna get to the...
Bizantine castle tidied as this army has to be. To the bath dirty worriers.
You, and specially you, to the bath.
I knew it.
- What a freak people. Who are they?
- The last dukes of Bysantium... precious blood and very sick.
Hectic limbs, weak using the sword... but fast using the dagger. People that you better lose than found.
- What about that empty place?
- It's my father's. - Time for his prayer, let's wait.
- Do you know what I'm gonna do?
Ask to your father a thousand of coins of gold. Thinking again, two thousand.
- Who's that pale but appetizing lady? - My sister.
No, not that one, the other one, that looks like a whore.
What do you say about aunt Teodora? She killed her husband with a poisoned...
- Dagger sending him directly to hell. - Jesus Christ.
To please her lover.
Which one?
That one with the bowl.
- My goodness!
You have to drink it, hot wine with spices.
Aren't you afraid of the pain? I like you.
You're welcome. I'll cure your strong hand.
She... - Go!
She's a great lover.
- What about Type? Doesn't he mind?
Yes, he does.
- But, do you care? - Of course not. - So?
- You're in charge of the negotiations.
But with respect, don't be too fast.
I'm going to take a big cash from them.
I'm Brancaleone from Norcia.
Do you know to make love the same way you know how to suffer the pain?
Yeah, but actually a long time I...
Pleasure and pain... are one thing.
- Do you want to make it? - Of course I want! - Take off your clothes.
- Right now.
It's gonna be this way. Let's make it.
Let's make it, let's make it.
- Make it, make it.
- What's that, woman? Are you crazy?
- Ouch, stop it, stop it.
- Take it, spank me, too.
- Ouch, I'm gonna take it, I go.
Wait. - Take it, go ahead.
- That's what you want? Right.
- That's it, spank me again.
You bizantine.
Take it! Do you like it?
So, take it.
No, not on me! No! - I love you.
- I love you.
Stop it!
Zefirino Abacuc, master of finances of Lord Brancaleone... that made your son his prisoner, after a combat, and the old people... say great value, great price.
And the value of your son is great.
But, considering your tender heart of a father, we'll ask you a lower value. - Three thousand.
- Three thousand what?
- Coins of gold, no?
- No. No?
Will you let your son as a prisoner...
Submissive to hard works?
And abandoned, doesn't your heart gets hurt as a father? - We'll do it for two...
- No.
You can take him, and you can spank him as you want...
- I'm gonna like it. - It went wrong.
He's the shame of the family, the black sheep, a thief and a tramp...
He is the bastard son I had with a servant of mine against my will.
Neither a coin of gold, nor a tin, that's his price.
That's right, but he is your son.
One thousand and everybody is happy.
You trashy accomplices!
When the bell rings for the third time... you must be out of here or you'll be killed by poisoned arrows. Poisoned arrows.
Look at them.
You bastard, I wish I've never seen you before.
Wait. Abacuc, how much did you get?
Where are you going, ah?
Why are you running?
What's going on?
Take your weapons.
Betrayal, let's run away.
I cover the back.
Come on, hurry up.
Come on.
- Neither I knew it.
- So, you're my relative.
I see signal of smoke. Watch out.
These lands are unknown and wild.
Two brave men are going... to open the way. You stay here.
You go.
Did he make a fire?
It's not a daddy bear, by the head and by the ears it looks like a mummy bear.
Let's go over there.
What?
- We thought you had died... - Are you with the bear?
- Come on.
Go, go.
- Did you see her?
- Does she bite? - No, she is gentle.
She found me in pieces, and took care of me and... took me to the cave like she was my Godmother.
But I don't claim, one day I eat chestnut, the other day, chicory... or else a frog and I'm still alive.
So, let's go, good luck. No, wait, I'm going with you.
But, let's go slowly.
If she notice she's gonna eat us. - She's like an animal.
Come on. - But...
Pecoro, she is looking for you.
She is there.
Be a good girl, I'm going with my friends. I'll come back soon.
Help.
We'd better stay here. Be careful.
I'm very sick.
No, what bad?
You're just a little ill. Soon you'll get strong again, listen to the old Branca.
My time is over, I know it.
I already don't have the pain on my foot.
- I'm tired. - Abacuc...
Even if it's like you say, I think you're gonna be okay.
I don't know if you die, you'll go to our Christian paradise.
Or of your people, or of the God you've had before. For sure, I believe that it'll be better than the life... - We are having here.
You are not going to be cold, neither hot.
Neither hungry, nor thirsty.
- Neither spanks.
- Nor scares.
You'll have a heaven always beautiful.
Birds and flowered trees. Angels that will give you big breads, cheeses, wine and milk. And they'll say: do you want, old man?
Eat. Do you want more?
Take it.
Eat... drink till you get satisfied.
Sleep, sleep. Sleep.
Look, men, look.
That is Aurocastro!
Look it now, men of a little faith.
The sound of the bell of Zenone, you abandoned too early the happiness.
The monk's back.
A cow. A cow!
God doesn't want you to suffer anymore.
Branca, Branca.
Citizens of Aurocastro, open up the gates for your Lord... that came by imperial will to guide you, to protect you and... to administrate you, open it up for Brancaleone... from Norcia and Aurocastro and for his army.
I'm Quaratino, an ancient of this village, this is the key of the city. Follow me to the Fortress and I'll show you what belongs to you.
Come on. - One moment, the lmperial possession. - You don't need to.
You'll read it later.
You're few, but good. Come on, we can't waste time. Here it's the cellar.
We've left a little wine in there. Not now.
We are all peasants always fighting.
Now that you are here, show us that you are brave men.
Do you see something?
A black flag.
It's the damned ones, they are back. Give them a lesson so, they are never coming... back here to rob anymore.
Thank you, Knight, and to you and to the Great Lord of Saxon... that nominated you, go fighting our defenders, attack with violence... those sanguinary.
Fight and God be with you. With you.
But... what sanguinary?
"The black danger that comes from the sea".
It's the Saracen pirates that come every year from the sea to...
- Sack. - It had to end up this way, I was an... - Idiot to follow you.
- Old Branca, we got screw.
Friends, brothers, soldiers, there's only one thing to do:
To run away! What are you saying, Mangoldo?
We have only one thing to do: to fight!
This is our Fortress, and those people are trusting us and... put their hopes on us.
Taccone, I nominate you, "Primus Miles."
Teofilatto will be your Captain and under you Mangoldo, "Miles Simplicius".
Zito, I want to give you a proof of my esteem.
The good news is... I nominate you, Master of Weapons.
We have to be firm till night to discourage the... enemy and encourage the peasants to come back, to fight and to win.
Come!
Don't be afraid, men.
I have a plan that will exterminate the enemy.
Let's see. Take off the board that cover the cellar.
Aquilante, where are you? Where are you?
I have a job for you. Get ropes, hooks and pulleys prepared.
Aquilante, come here.
Calm down. Calm down. Hey, you.
- They are coming again.
Prepare a great quantity of rocks.
It will have their function when the moment comes. And now listen to me.
The Saracenl throw themselves with a big arch because the gate is there to resist. But the gate's going to open like the arms of... a lover, and the Saracen, pushed by their own...
- Strength, will fall into the trench. - Do you think that the horse is gonna... pull the rope that opens the gate to your command?
Taccone, get your sling ready.
The useless horse hit by the projectile of our slinger... is gonna move, for sure.
- It's only what I can see.
- That's enough.
When you see it opening, in order to close the trench with that table as a cover, you'll cut the rope with your vigorous sword.
Pecoro, you'll put fire to the ray and you'll throw it into the trench... to burn the infidels.
Teofilatto and Mangoldo get prepared... stretch the arrow. The plan was elaborated very carefully.
Now...
I'm going to tell you how to move precisely and synchronized.
Go, Taccone. Keep on alert, my heroes.
Till now, you are covered by shit, cover yourself with glory now.
- Commander? - What happened?
- Pecoro, Mangoldo...
- What happened? What's going on?
- Help me. - Give me the hand.
- Put all your strength, that's it.
- Damned asshole.
Let's close our lines. Open up.
Zito, the heavens are gonna curse you.
Open up.
I barely know them!
- Damned parchment. - And damned Moorish that came... - From the sea.
- No more crying.
You always lived like women, try at least to die... like men.
You call this die like a man?
Christian knights
Come on, my rescuers.
- Cheers for the Christendom!
Attack.
Carefully, carefully, brothers.
Don't cut the rope.
God bless you, Knight, thank you very much. - You saved us, God bless.
- I'm your slave.
Glorious Knight, without you, I won't be here now to thank you... and saluting you with all of his men
Brancaleone from Norcia. Master and owner of Aurocastro, its vineyards and its cattle. I ask your permission, my dear Lord, to have you here as hosts... to eat and to drink in my castle.
What?
It's not because of the end that I cry, but for the beginning.
I was deceived by that parchment. It's our fault, if we're here now... forgive us, Brancaleone.
What point in complaining?
We need to love and to forgive at death's time. We need to love and to forgive.
Listen, Brancaleone, I did you wrong...
- And I want to confess my faults. - You don't need to, brother. We arrived at this point, no way out.
We need to love and to forgive... at death's time.
We need to love and to forgive.
I ask for your forgiveness.
It was me that abused of Matelda.
You disgraceful traitor. You dirty man.
I'm going to exterminate you...
I'm going to exterminate you, damned.
- It's him!
- It's Zenone! - Brother.
- Who's that?
Hold on, I don't know who you're and why you want to burn the men.
- That's it, monk.
- But their lives don't belong to you...
- We belong to you. - Listen to me, Saint Man... - They are traitors and deserve to die.
- Yes, they do... As all of us.
But their lives are not yours... but of the Lord that is in heaven, and He said that... it'll be pure who purifies the impure.
- I want to be pure.
- All of them swore to go with me... to the Holy Land, to fight against the infidel, and nobody can... take any man from the lines that want to die happy for the Saint Sepulcher.
Keep on your knees, Christians. - On your knees.
- Obey, obey. - That's the way God wants.
- Obey.
"Vade retro Satana, vade retro Satana... without fear... without shoes, without money... without cup... without pussy..." Aquilante? Ah!
Come on, my faithful animal.
Give me the sword.
Well, my brave men, leave all the discouragement behind... chest out... stand up the weapons, flags up, self confidence... and let's forget Aurocastro, across the sea blood and glory... are waiting for us, like the wolf that attacks and the lion that catches... we keep walking till the Holy Land.
Branca, Branca, Branca.
[Subtitles revisited by Portretmacaka]
Go on!
Faster!
They went that way.
Smith, what's going on?
I pick up Clark, I don't know why.
He's killed, I don't know who by.
- I'm not curious...
- But you want to be briefed.
- Indeed.
- It's your right.
Eight months ago, the State Department was contacted by a mysterious organisation wishing to sell a new weapon, something that couldn't be traced or destroyed.
The usual blackmail, all bluff.
Not quite.
You'll see.
After some difficulties, we had Clark hired in one of the organisation's secret laboratories.
Where I picked him up.
He couldn't tell us what he knew.
What price was this invention?
100 million dollars.
That's exactly what HQ thought.
If we refused, they threatened to blow up one of our bases.
When? Last night at eight o'clock.
These pictures were recorded by the cameras at Base 124, which was destroyed.
Yet all our bases received the alert instructions.
- This one too.
- Of course.
Thanks to that, there were no victims.
There.
Five seconds before the explosion.
Three seconds.
One second.
This is all we picked up.
What's that?
The radars showed a silhouette identical to one of our F107 fighters.
The flight plans have been checked, but no F107 aircraft were over the region on that day.
- Maybe it was a fake F107. - What?
One second before the explosion, the plane is small in the photo.
So it was a long way from the base.
None of its missiles could have reached the base in less than a second. Exactly.
Excuse me, but let's suppose it is an F107, a tiny little F107.
It would be near the base and small on the photo.
That's a tiny little secret agent's idea!
A tiny little secret agent's idea is better than none at all.
Rollston, our agent in Tokyo, has just sent us a report in which he too mentions the hypothesis of miniature planes.
- My dear Hubert...
- I get it.
You're sending me to Japan.
Yes.
Here are your orders.
A military flight is leaving right away.
Babcock, our CIA resident in Tokyo, is waiting for you and will have you contact Rollston.
Clear?
Very.
- Ralph Babcock, Tokyo CIA.
- Charmed.
- Here are my orders.
- Saki.
- Very honoured.
- He knows the country well.
- When can I see Rollston?
- It won't be possible.
We've had no news from him since yesterday morning.
That's a good start.
He said that if anything stopped him getting in contact, we must protect a woman from the code section at the embassy, Eva Wilson.
Protect her?
He said it was of the greatest importance.
- I must see her quickly.
- She's waiting in my office.
Go ahead, Mrs Wilson.
We're listening.
Please...
I'd rather Rollston explained himself.
For lots of reasons, I'd rather you explained.
It's not pleasant to say...
Especially in front of men.
Eva, please, it's very important.
There's not a minute to lose.
Well, one evening, a few months ago,
I met an officer in Tokyo.
He was friendly and amusing.
We went to a cabaret, the Mikado.
We danced and...
And then?
I don't know what happened.
I don't remember.
I remember waking up in a bedroom in a Tokyo suburb.
A room I'd never seen.
It was morning and I was alone.
It's pretty incredible.
Carry on.
I never saw the officer again.
But a week later, I was visited by a Japanese man.
I'd seen him at the cabaret.
He came to show me photos.
- Photos of me. - Yes.
If I've got this right, the photos taken with this officer in the hotel were...
How can I put it?
Compromising.
Yes.
- Do you have the photos? - No.
It was blackmail.
He threatened to send them to my husband.
- Your husband in Washington?
- Yes.
If I didn't supply certain information.
Don't worry, your husband won't see those photos, because you gave them the information.
- You knew? - Yes.
- Since when?
- Since you started your story.
What kind of information was it?
- The radio codes of a base.
- Which base?
- Base 124, obviously.
- 124?
The one that was destroyed.
Yes.
Mrs Wilson, this is a matter for the courts.
We have to repatriate you forthwith. As a result, we'll...
We'll...
let you go free.
Why?
My dear Babcock, you understand.
The Japanese man will try to contact poor Eva Wilson again for more information.
It's our only chance to trace the network to the top.
Yes.
So don't be discouraged, Mrs Wilson.
Be reassured.
Tomorrow your husband will be here, never to leave you.
- My husband?
- He arrives tomorrow at 10am.
What husband?
Mr Wilson.
We'll grant his wife extended leave for a pleasant vacation in Tokyo.
In Tokyo?
My husband?
Yes.
Arrival of KLM flight 228, from Washington.
Exit gate B.
Hello, Eva!
Eva!
You've got a nerve.
Always. That's why I'm a colonel.
- You should be a general.
- You're not the first to say that.
- Hello, Eva.
- Hello.
So glad to finally meet your husband.
Come for a drink on Wednesday.
We'll go, we don't want to intrude.
See you soon.
Goodbye.
Hello.
You know Eva's husband just got here?
Is this really necessary?
It's very pleasant.
I'd like a little more conviction.
- That's not your case, Colonel.
- My name's John, don't forget.
The only reason I'm here is so that everyone you know in Tokyo knows that your husband has arrived.
- Right.
- "Right, John."
You take your role as husband very seriously.
Very.
Might I ask how far you intend to take this role?
When it comes to defending my country, I have no limits.
It's a very ancient custom.
These papers answer all the questions we may have.
What does mine say?
"Time favours an honest man's projects."
That's good.
And this one?
"You don't argue with the wind.
So why argue with a woman?"
- What's wrong?
- He's the blackmailer.
What does he want?
To meet me tonight at the Seng Su temple.
I expected this.
You'll go.
- Alone?
- No, I'll follow.
He'll spot you.
Have no fear, I'll be far off.
You'll carry a mic.
Where will you hide it?
Here.
It's not a Cartier, but it's precious.
Latest-generation Japanese technology.
May I?
Where shall I put the battery?
Turn around, please.
That's perfect.
Are you cold?
Pass me the wire.
Thank you.
You really think it'll be of any use?
- Pessimist.
- I'm a realist.
He speaks Japanese, you won't understand.
You'll skim through a phrasebook...
Who says I'll be listening alone?
There!
Don't take this as a compliment, but you really are made to wear a battery.
- Thank you.
- Now let's test it.
Go on, speak.
I could tell you everything the man says without using a mic.
You're wary of me.
That's fine, then.
Always beware of women with a beauty spot on their hip. Yes.
Just there.
- There, I'm ready.
- Let's go.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Do what I said and it'll be fine.
If you're in danger, call me immediately.
When you leave him, go straight home.
Got that?
Yes.
If he's not there, I'll wait a few minutes, then go home.
Those are my orders, aren't they?
I'll tell you what I think of you now.
How brave you are, Colonel, having me take all the risks to accomplish your mission.
Good evening.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
John Wilson.
How do you feel?
Fine.
How about you?
Me hit head on low ceiling.
Mama-san says you broke the camera.
Of course, how silly of me!
There.
How many?
Five?
Three, four and five.
- Hello.
- At last!
I've waited hours. I was worried sick.
- That's very nice.
- What were you doing?
Silly things.
I banged my head.
- Is it serious?
- No.
But it's tiresome.
I lost track of your friend.
How did you get on at the temple?
He was suspicious and ripped out the microphone.
He'll set up another meeting, but if I do it again, he'll...
Eliminate you?
- That's perfect.
- I hope you're joking.
No, I'm quite serious.
Think about it.
If they're interested in you, they'll show up. - Somehow or another.
- And kill me?
No, don't worry.
There's no danger.
Because I'm honoured to have your protection?
You could say "happy".
It'll be fine, you'll see.
We've a whole night to think about it.
Have you ever been called a cad? No.
I kill people before they have time to say it.
- Will you kill me?
- Not yet.
I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself.
What must I do?
Kiss me.
I don't want to kiss you.
- Very well. In that case...
- Where are you going?
Hilton Hotel, room 122.
If you're shot at, call me.
Hubert!
Apologising?
I'm scared.
Then just trust me.
Definitely not.
Do you want a Band-Aid?
You'd better hurry.
He won't be around long.
Stop! I didn't want to kill you.
It's a terrible misunderstanding!
- Explain!
- Just a simple needle to make honourable foreigner sleep.
Honourable!
- What for?
- To take you...
- Where?
- To chat with friends.
Fine.
Then take me quietly where I'm meant to go.
- It's easy.
- But very embarrassing for...
- For whom?
- For Mr Chang.
This toy fires 9mm needles and makes holes you can't stitch up.
Shall we go?
You'll swear Mr Chang only gave in to violence?
You're a reasonable man.
This way.
Hey...
- Where am I going?
- Right on the bridge.
And now?
You carry straight on.
We're right behind you, Mr Wilson.
Do exactly as you're told or your car will blow up.
Glance behind you.
You'll see a magnetic mine.
Any suspicious moves, and it'll blow you up.
Turn right now.
- Can I say something?
- Speak, Mr Chang.
I'm sorry to evoke my personal case, but as the disappearance of my miserable person is not indispensable, I could get out of car. Impossible.
If you got out, he'd do the same.
Till now you've been satisfied with my services.
That's true.
But we have no choice.
Did you hear?
Above all, no funny business.
And do everything they say.
I've got it.
And I'll follow your instructions.
It's in your interest, Mr Wilson.
That's good, very good.
You're a wise man.
"The tree clings to its fruit..."
"As the wise man does his life." Confucius.
Both wise and educated, that's very good.
No, thank you.
A few months ago, I met an officer in Tokyo.
He was friendly and amusing.
We went to a cabaret, the Mikado.
We danced and...
And then?
I don't know what happened.
I was visited by a Japanese man.
I'd seen him at the cabaret.
- What was he doing there?
- He was with a girl.
Pretty?
Not especially.
- You're sure it's her? - Yes.
Excuse me, I need to take a closer look.
Professional curiosity.
I know your professional curiosity.
- Jealous?
- Wouldn't you be pleased!
Good evening.
- How much?
- Three tickets to dance.
- And if we have a drink?
- Another three.
I'll buy now before the price rises.
Eva, this is Miss Three Tickets.
- Tetsuko.
- Miss...
Tetsuko, my sister.
She's in a bad mood because she lost a bet.
As I'm shy, she bet I wouldn't dare invite you. There.
Let's go.
You're becoming bolder all the time.
He doesn't look like a shy boy.
You don't know him.
He hides it well.
Eva, it's one o'clock. Mother will worry.
You said you'd be back by midnight.
Our mother has asthma.
It's sad.
The doctors think that was what caused my brother's epilepsy.
If it happens, act right away to bring the blood back to the head. Like this.
Good evening.
I wish you lots of patience and courage.
- Good night, John.
- Good night, sister dear...
Don't wait up.
I may be back late.
I'm looking for a friend.
- Does he come here often?
- Yes, you must know him.
- Maybe.
- He's Japanese.
Like 50 million other men.
I know. But he often wears a mac.
He's quite tall.
It's still very vague.
Wait.
He has a scar under the right eye.
That's somewhat less vague.
- You really know him? - Yes.
Do you know him too?
- No, I don't know him.
- Shame.
I'm sorry.
Is he so interesting?
No, not at all.
I'm interested in you.
What about a drink elsewhere?
What do you mean by "a drink elsewhere"?
- Ending the evening together.
- I'm very flattered. But I can't leave before the end of the party.
That said, I can't dance with you any more.
Why?
You've no more tickets.
Don't go.
- There.
- Thank you.
I've got a friend to cover for me.
We can go.
- Right now?
- If you like.
Then let's go.
Excuse me.
Here, old chap.
A gift from the UN.
Where are we going?
To a ryokan.
Great.
What's that?
You don't know ryokan?
It's a comfortable, isolated inn.
- What's your name?
- John Wilson.
Are you married?
Yes.
But don't worry, my wife stayed in the US.
I'm not worried.
What are you doing in Tokyo?
- I'm an agent...
- For a large industrial company.
You guessed.
I sell diggers and earthmovers and... ..bulldozers.
A sales argument?
It eliminates the competition.
You're well equipped.
You too.
- What's that?
- A mic.
Odd.
What's that for?
Almost all the Mikado dancers wear them.
To find out if a client is proper.
So everything I said...
They heard, of course.
Does that bother you?
Not at all.
- Where's the battery?
- In the sleeve.
- Do go in.
- After you.
- No.
You must take your shoes off.
- I'm sorry.
The owner says you must wear a kimono.
Very well.
You must go with them.
With pleasure.
What did you say?
Sorry, just passing through.
Oh, you want me to stay with you.
Watch out, this will burn!
Come on, you'll catch cold.
What are you doing in my car?
Looking for you.
You disappeared.
There's something I don't get.
Oh...
Who might you be?
Colonel Kawachi, Japanese secret service. Charmed.
John Wilson.
Yes, I know.
It's the name on your passport.
Your behaviour since arriving has been strange and I have another hypothesis.
Which?
I think you're a CIA agent, maybe even OSS 117.
I'm too flattered to deny it.
I told Tetsuko to organise an interview in the ryokan.
The sumotori who wanted you to stay didn't have time to tell you.
You are impatient.
That's true.
We're all pretty nervous at the moment.
- One of our agents is missing.
- Rollston?
- You knew?
- I know everything that goes on.
I can help you if you bring me up to speed.
So, what are you looking for?
One of your compatriots with a scar under the right eye.
- This young lady knows him.
- We're looking for him too.
That's why Tetsuko-san works at the Mikado.
I see.
It's becoming clearer now.
Believe me, things would be much easier if our services collaborated more closely.
Absolutely.
I'd love to collaborate with a pretty taxi-girl.
She's not a taxi-girl.
She's a sergeant.
Sergeant, I like you a lot.
I like you too, Colonel.
We're going to work well together.
That's my impression too, Colonel.
- I should have been suspicious.
- Of what?
Japanese women.
I had been warned, though.
You're fearsome.
Are you afraid?
This is a baptism of sorts.
Your first Japanese kiss? No.
My first sergeant.
Colonel Kawachi.
- Can I see the film?
- Yes, you shall.
Let's go, then.
Stop!
Interesting, no?
Very interesting.
Did you check the plates?
The number's fake.
Next day, two men were waiting as she left the Mikado.
She took the same car. Stop.
Print several shots of that.
Interesting, it's true.
What will you do?
Talk to her.
Eva?
It's me, John.
No, everything's fine.
Tetsuko?
In the end, I wasn't her type.
Look, I have to go to Hong Kong for two days.
Yes, immediately.
Could you bring my bag to the airport?
Well?
Someone arrived at her place 15 minutes ago.
Show me.
Here.
Hello, Babcock?
Yes, it's me.
Telephone Mrs Wilson.
Have her come on some pretext.
And try to keep her there for 10 minutes.
Thanks.
- Who are you?
- And you?
I'm asking the questions here.
Why?
Because I have a gun.
And because my wife lives here.
Your wife?
- You are John Wilson?
- Exactly.
- That's odd.
- Why?
You don't look like him.
- You know him?
- Slightly.
I'm in no mood for jokes.
I'm sorry, but I came to see my wife.
Your wife?
Yes, Eva.
I'm Eva's husband.
Do you have some ID?
Sorry, Mr Wilson.
I didn't expect you.
Sorry for asking questions, but you're pretending to be me.
Why?
Eva is in danger, I'm looking out for her.
I see why she was so mysterious and nervous.
- Cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.
Thank you.
So you live here. With her.
Yes.
Don't think I feel bitter.
Eva and I have been separated for two years.
We intend to divorce.
We just don't get on.
I'm in Tokyo on business.
I thought I'd drop in.
I understand.
You say she's in danger.
Is she risking her life?
That's not impossible.
I advised her not to take that job in the cipher office.
It's too risky. She didn't listen.
Don't worry, I've no intention of embarrassing you.
Tell Eva I've understood the situation.
I shall.
I'll be going.
Look after her, Mr Wilson.
I am, Mr Wilson.
Still here?
I told you to go.
Please leave.
Am I in the way?
- Happy to see me?
Of course.
I like to hear you say it.
I had to come back.
I've something to ask you.
- Something important? - Yes.
This Japanese man who set up the meeting, did he snatch the mic off you?
Yes.
How did he do it?
Show me.
How exactly?
Like this.
It didn't tear your dress?
No.
The clip can't have been closed properly.
Sorry, but it was.
I did it myself.
What happened to the wire and the battery?
I don't know, I was so scared.
I don't remember.
Yes, you must have been terrified.
You didn't walk home, did you?
No.
I took a taxi straight away.
There's something I don't understand.
Look.
Here you're taking the clip off.
And it's an odd taxi you took.
And at the Mikado, you didn't tell me two men were waiting for you.
That reminds me.
I met one of your friends.
- Where?
- Here.
Here?
You know what his name is?
John Wilson.
Amusing, isn't it?
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Saki's been killed.
- Where?
- At the Yochi temple.
I'll be right there.
Mrs Wilson, let me jog your memory.
The blackmail, the compromising photos. You made it all up, didn't you?
No one forced you to give out radio frequencies. No.
Then why?
For whom?
Give me the reason.
- You saw the reason for yourself.
- Your husband?
So he's part of the organisation.
- Are you too?
- No, I swear!
Come with me.
My husband's a great technician, but too ambitious.
I left him after five years.
Why?
- Because of the people he saw.
- Which people?
Foreign financiers.
He was working on an invention that'd make our fortune.
I hadn't seen him in two years and he showed up in Tokyo.
- Demanding information? - Yes.
He said if I refused the organisation would execute him.
Do you love him?
No, but I lived with him for five years.
- What else do you know?
- Absolutely nothing.
I don't even know where he lives in Tokyo.
- That's horrible.
- Poor Saki...
Hubert, I just spoke to Smith.
The organisation's deadline expires tomorrow morning.
- Washington has agreed to negotiate. - What?
To negotiate?
Indeed.
The ransom will be paid tomorrow at dawn.
The organisation will tell us what to do.
- It's a fool's deal. - Why?
The organisation could sell the plans to anyone after us.
If we negotiate, it'll keep its base and the blackmail will begin again. Possible.
But our HQ can't let another base be blown up.
We have strict orders: to do nothing.
We're supposed to lay low and attempt nothing.
Anyway, I don't see what you could do.
Indeed.
I think I'll take a holiday.
Mrs Wilson is of no further use.
Best send her to Washington as soon as possible.
She'll be tried as planned.
So it's true?
You're giving up?
You've a bad opinion of me.
I never give up.
Then why send her to Washington?
To play my final card.
I'm sorry but I can't do anything for you.
The organisation won't let me leave Japan.
- Why did Hubert...
- Look out!
They're not the ones to follow.
Wait a while.
Fetch a doctor.
Eva!
Stop!
Now it's our turn, Sergeant.
Let's go!
I know, I'm sorry.
I work at the embassy.
We'll do a test, Sergeant.
I'll dial a number.
I had no choice, Eva.
If you'd gone to Washington, they'd have made you talk.
You'd have spent years in prison.
Ten years, maybe 20.
You'd be poor and old when you got out.
- And now?
- Now we can sort it out.
You're safe, you're out of danger.
Tomorrow it'll all be over.
You'll be able to live as you like.
You'll be free.
And seven.
Well?
The number isn't in the book.
They'll give it to me.
Strange.
It's the number of Yokota-san's house.
- Yokota?
Who's that?
- A Korean industrialist.
- What does he make?
- He's in electronics.
Electronics...
You can meet my partners.
Mr Yokota, Mr Vargas, my wife.
Very pleased to meet you, Mrs Wilson.
Allow me to congratulate you.
Congratulate me?
Firstly on your great beauty.
And for the help you've given our organisation.
I'm very grateful.
That's why I insisted on your not being harmed.
It's much safer if you're with us.
Much safer for everyone.
Meanwhile, this house is your house.
Yonake remains at your disposal.
If you need the slightest thing, he is, as I am myself, at your service.
Gentlemen...
See you later, Mrs Wilson.
- I didn't think I'd see you again. - Disappointed?
Surprised.
You underestimated me.
Indeed.
The old Korean with all the manners, is he Yokota?
Yes.
- And the other?
- Vargas, a shipbuilder.
Did you learn anything?
The trade is tomorrow on the blue mountain pass, south of Nagasaki.
They bring the plans, the Americans bring money.
- Where's their base?
- I don't know.
I just know we're leaving tonight aboard a fast boat. Perfect.
I'll give you something.
It's a quartz transmitter.
When you're in their base, plug it into any power point.
It'll send a constant fixed-frequency signal.
- I'll try. - Do it.
It's the only way I'll know where you are.
- And then? - I'll sort it out.
- You asked for tea?
- Yes, why?
It's coming.
Good luck.
- Well?
- Everything's ready, Colonel.
We're on the quartz wavelength.
Good.
Keep listening.
All we can do now is wait.
There.
Contact received, Colonel.
42 degrees north.
126 east.
- It's out at sea.
- On a boat?
- Probably.
- Let's go right away.
And keep in contact.
En route, pretty soldier.
- We're relying on you.
- I know.
Count on me, Colonel.
- Be careful.
- I'll try.
Eva, ready?
They're waiting for us.
Yes, I'll be right there.
What's the matter?
- Yokota scares me.
- Why?
Because he likes you.
It's true, you are beautiful.
You've never been so beautiful.
I should never have let you go.
Do you think we could live together again?
Soon we'll be richer than you ever dreamed.
Come on, they're waiting.
Roger.
Get out of the clouds so we can have a look.
Ease off the gas and maintain this course.
Battery number two.
Received.
Battery number three.
Received.
I'll let you know when Vargas gets there.
Roger.
Please go aboard.
I'll stay on your wavelength.
If it doesn't go as planned...
Go and watch them.
..be ready to react.
Rely on me.
At my signal, launch a missile on Base 139.
- Are we in contact with Vargas?
- Not yet, Yokota-san.
Vargas here.
I'm at the spot.
The truck's getting into position.
Hello.
Wilson here.
- Can you hear me?
- I can.
We're at 22 degrees by 452.
We're 60 nautical miles from US Base 139.
Roger, thank you.
If the Americans are on time, they should be at the rendezvous... ..in 30 seconds.
There they are.
Attention.
Attention.
Do not leave the aircraft before showing us that you are in possession of the planned ransom, 100 million dollars in raw diamonds.
Your assessor can check the material.
You will find the guidance formulae in the truck, the composition of metals for cladding the nuclear charge, and the formulae for the explosives.
- They set a trap for us.
- Do as planned, immediately.
Right.
Take off, quick!
Wilson, the Americans have reneged on the deal.
- Blow up their base.
- Roger. Execution.
Firing at plus 20.
Device launched.
We're starting the countdown.
Radiation, maximum charge.
Let's go now!
Fetch the coordinates of their ship.
The map's on the table.
35 degrees north.
126 east.
I've got it.
Phone call for Mr Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath.
Paging Mr Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath.
Phone call for Mr Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath.
Subtitles by Silverway Media
- Mr Fabre!
- Please.
They told me to go to Vienna, and get in touch with Margery.
They mentioned leaks.
And they put Margery in doubt.
The crippled double agent...
I could not believe it.
Speaking for myself.
Did you have a good trip?
Excellent, yes.
They'll wait for you at this address, after the concert.
It's a cafe.
Your recognition codes...
No need.
The crippled and me go back 15 years.
But is he hiding something, Margery...
It's that, at this moment...
At this moment?
If you need to see me again, ask for a freebie here for the next concert, as a foreigner.
Do you remember?
As a foreigner...
Right now, I need Margery.
Hello, yes?
Ah it's you.
You're doing what?
I'll wait for you.
Get out... as fast as you can.
Hello?
Hello?
I got your message.
Here I am.
What's the matter?
We're leaving in 3 days.
Wednesday morning, to be exact.
In 3 days, we leave hell to others.
You even deserve to leave tomorrow.
I must leave everything in order.
The last unit arrives Wednesday on the 7 PM train.
Hoffmann lends us a room at the station.
You will arrive at 7:30.
All will be settled.
And at 8 PM, we'll take the train to Italy.
You won't go directly to France?
Later.
First of all, the sun.
An old, sunny wall...
Peace.
An clear head.
In 3 days.
- You'll stay and live there?
- Perhaps.
You can come to Weigelt.
I hope that my possible presence won't disturb you.
Did you think of what I have to do when leaving?
Talk to him?
Leave a letter for him?
Always leave as you have come.
Like lightning.
- Do you speak French?
- Yes, a bit.
I'd like a free ticket for tonight.
A freebie?
But why?
As a foreigner, passing through.
For special tickets, talk to the director.
- His office is that way.
- Over there?
- Yes, first door on your right.
- Thank you.
Come in.
I asked for a freebie, as a foreigner.
The management temporarily suspended that rule.
Could I see a manager?
That would seem unnecessary.
Please remain seated and write.
If you want to live, don't fake anything.
"Box # 12.
The person will arrive late."
Unnecessary, it was me who sent you that message.
Write all the same.
Perfect.
- You have your methods...
- Fast ones, I'm short of time.
Tell me about Margery.
Margery?
- You didn't see him?
- He wasn't at the meeting.
How did you get in here?
The tall blond showed me the trick.
Wolf... since his death, I don't know what to do any more.
Did they kill him?
I don't know.
Help me to meet Margery, it's urgent.
Urgent...
For him or for you?
For him.
He started out here with me.
That was the most persevering foreigner at the concerts.
He talks of music and war better than anyone.
- You became his confidant.
- I'm proud of it.
With good reason.
When he enlarged the network, he should have consulted you.
You know everybody.
He'll tell you the rest himself. Our stop.
That's 100 m from here. 2, Ulrich Platz, at the end of the court.
- Alright, I'm off.
- Tell me.
- If he doesn't live there anymore?
- That'd surprise me.
- He would have let me know.
- And if he's not there?
Well... there's still Hoffmann.
He works at the central station.
He's there every day.
Thanks.
- Who is that?
- Chalieff.
- Is it at that point?
- You see...
I'm grilled.
Carbonized.
That was my last hideout.
- Is he in Vienna?
- Yes, with a band of scabby dogs.
His task is to take out all the other networks.
I even tried hard at avoiding to meet you.
Lucky that I stayed. Perhaps you were wrong.
The one who contacted me has been hit by a car.
- Wolf?
- Maybe it was an accident...
- The driver fled.
- Did you come to make fun of me?
- No.
- Why did you come?
I'll tell you.
But let's not rot in there for too long.
In Paris, they think that you took a side road.
That's not possible?
That's all they think?
That may surprise you, but it leaves me cold.
When I was young and naive, I don't know how I would have taken that.
But today, what they are thinking...
doesn't come as a surprise from them.
- And you, what do you think?
- Nothing, I came to listen to you.
You are an accomplished controller?
What do you want me to tell you?
What more do they want to know?
Ah yes... there is something they still don't know.
That for me, it's over.
Finished.
You'll tell them...
Yes, I'm out.
If I still had doubts about it, you just took them away.
They're doubting me.
Really, their memory is too short.
You'll see, Pascal...
It'll happen to you too.
In Paris, that helps to make themselves feel important.
Here, that's all.
For the rest, if they don't have the monthly report yet, it's because I still need something from a guy in Chalieff's embassy. I'll have it tomorrow.
I'll give you the coordinates of the network.
They are 20.
It is intact.
You can be in control yourself.
Control, controller!
Your network, it's not my business.
Then what is your business?
You've never dropped a bone yet...
Come on, go ahead.
I have to take your next dispatch and ask you to go back with me...
Now that you want to leave, that makes it all easier.
Right.
Since I'm big enough to travel alone, I'll see them from my side.
Is that all?
Yes.
Do they know that the Ricans and the English have been liquidated?
- And that only we are left?
- Yes.
They ignore how I've steered the boat this far...
- They think that they've paid you.
- Admirable!
You'll become a great leader.
You've changed, ever since the day they stopped you from killing Barsac.
Tell me...
Why have they sent you?
You... impossible, they've drawn lots!
No...
So... why you?
To them, I'm the only man you won't kill.
I believe they're making real progress.
While we're waiting, is tomorrow still OK?
Yes, after lunch.
- 2 PM at the pub of the other night.
- The thing is that you come.
You have my word.
- Is this Master Weigelt's?
- Yes.
I'm the new secretary.
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm a personal friend and I wish to see him.
Master Weigelt is expecting you.
- Good morning, master.
- Usually you call me.
- Do you have a new secretary?
- Don't worry.
He doesn't know any more about it than the other.
What brings me the pleasure of your visit?
I beg your hospitality.
Here?
Out of the question.
For only 48 hours.
- You don't know anybody but me.
- But I trust you.
- Perhaps you're wrong.
- You know very well I'm not.
2 days, that's short.
Maybe you like to consult your charming friend.
That's not the point.
She's not here.
She only thinks about her singing tour.
Singer...
Stupid idea.
She has all that a woman could wish for.
I get richer all the time, as you well know.
I offered her to travel, to get out of town.
She refuses.
Do you put the key under the door?
I consider doing that...
because of the sequel.
Do you know the sequel?
Yes.
It's reassuring.
Well, as you say...
The spare room is all yours.
If you want to use it.
Margery is with Weigelt.
And Weigelt?
How did he react?
- He tried to refuse.
- We run a great risk!
In the end, he accepted?
I don't want to mess with him.
Let's wait until Margery leaves.
Anna?
- Good morning, did you sleep well?
- Like an angel.
I'd have liked to greet your girlfriend, to say thanks...
She's in her room, sleeping.
That'll be later then...
Yes, I think he's here.
Hello, are you listening?
Something serious has happened.
They have taken out...
Kern works for me...
You'd better come with us without any fairy tales.
Mr Kern?
Yes.
I'm happy to see you.
My friend, how have you been since the Clifford affair?
You remember?
You see...
Mr Weigelt is at our service.
True, only recently...
But you can tell how well we are informed.
I'll put my cards on the table.
You and me are in the same trade.
So common ground should be possible.
Sit down, please.
Did the flowers arrive?
Sorry, I thought you were alone.
- My wife.
Mister?
- Fabre.
My compliments.
You'll join us in a minute, I hope.
- Sorry, it's all the consternation.
- He's a friend of Margery.
How is he?
Are you French?
Yes.
Oh, so much smoke... I like the French a lot.
Et Anna, what do you think of her?
- She's great, right?
- Should be if she's French.
- No, she's Swiss.
- Should be if she's Swiss...
- You don't know her?
- I haven't had the pleasure.
- We count him among our friends.
- She's an exciting girl.
Excuse me.
Your wife is charming.
But as to Margery, I prefer she doesn't know.
She knows only little.
I hope so.
Would it bother you to tell me how all this started?
- You, Margery...
- Not at all.
Once I hired a singer, Anna, whom you just heard about.
She and Ingrid have become friends.
Anna has class.
She lives in grand style.
Her protector is a lawyer.
Master Weigelt.
Anna had nice pictures of herself.
Ingrid wanted some too.
Anna got her in touch with her photographer:
Margery.
He has made a series of portraits of my wife.
You know women:
when we take care of them...
Painter, hairdresser, photographer...
One day Anna asked Ingrid to introduce her to a member of the Russian embassy in Vienna.
Ingrid knows everyone in Vienna.
By way of a friend in the Defense ministry, she fulfilled that wish.
That was the start.
And then Margery knew how to contact you directly?
Through Anna he knew that many of my clients work with the government.
He told me it was about keeping foreign influence in check.
I refused.
At last, you accepted to please your wife.
No...
I talked with others about it.
And right now, about 10 well placed people inform me knowledgeably.
And another 20 just for fun.
Who knows about your network, except for you and Margery?
Nobody.
Thank you.
- Would you like a whisky?
- Yes please, thank you.
The concert hall, does that mean anything to you?
- Yes.
- Do you know somebody there?
Nobody.
In case of need, one drops an envelope.
Margery will be alerted.
The urgent need is to limit the damage.
For that, we need to know who has been taken out.
That must be worth it.
Margery went crazy about it.
What time does your singer arrive at the beer house?
Right now she won't be going.
She's ill.
- At Weigelt's?
- Yes.
- Does she work for Margery?
- I don't know.
The information was only about last month?
Yes.
He completed it 2 days ago.
2 days, are you sure? He told me he couldn't do it before this morning.
He was waiting for a report from a guy of the embassy.
That's maybe a new element which I don't know.
Yes, maybe...
A real house of cards.
- What if we break this cane?
- Too dangerous.
If it contains microfilm, we might ruin it.
- Do you have a friend who's radiologist?
- No.
I know a radiologist, but he's not a friend.
Anyway, tell him whatever story you want.
As long as he X-rays the cane without any questions.
- I'll try.
- Get back here right away, don't pass by the beer house.
Stay close to your wife and wait for me here.
So?
Your behaviour is crazy.
You're playing for time but we are not in a hurry.
And we know already so much.
- Good for you.
Your latest microfilm is still in Vienna.
I can even tell you that it contains the minutes of an interesting meeting that took place in our embassy.
A meeting that wasn't about your country, nor mine, nor Austria.
Not about Europe, not even about America.
Do you get my point?
He may already have talked. He's a professional.
Even worse, for a professional.
He knows too much.
The more one knows, the weaker.
Your lady friend, does she know Margery?
No, she must have seen him only twice or thrice.
I'd really like to meet her.
She'll be discharged in 2 or 3 days.
But let's keep her out of this.
- She doesn't know about your activities?
- Obviously not.
Your specialism is war crimes.
- That borders on politics.
- Inevitably.
What's more lucrative to you, Margery or your clients?
I beg your pardon.
I have to know where Margery is, before he talks.
That's in the interest of all of us.
Could you find out more, from your side?
I can try.
Can we meet again at the end of the day, when you have news?
Not here, for sure.
Do you know the Arasch palace?
Yes.
Next to it there's a square, at the end of an alley.
I'll draw you a map.
The entrance of the gallery is on the left.
I'll wait for you next to the fountain.
You did a splendid job.
There's a Frenchman with us, In Vienna.
He's looking for you.
Who is it?
No use answering us.
May I ask with whom I am speaking?
I'm coming from Paris, I'm a friend of Margery.
Margery?
I don't know him.
I went to the concert hall.
I asked for a freebie, as a foreigner.
They gave me your address.
What do you want from me?
To know where Margery is.
I don't know his address.
Yes, I suspected as much.
Yet you probably see him often, right?
It depends.
He knows where to find me.
He drops in unexpectedly.
It's 2 or 3 weeks since he came to meet somebody at the 7 o'clock train.
- Whom?
- I don't know.
- What train?
- The Orient-Express.
But since then, no news.
Is that really all you know?
Why work for us?
For the money.
I think for you, it's the same.
Perhaps.
- Unbelievable, Viviani...
I've been thinking.
I think I can help you even more.
You have Margery.
Let my wife go, that's all I ask.
There's still time for the authorities of your country, to take care of your case. I'm listening.
I admit, we have Margery.
I'd have thought that from then on, you could have benefitted, with your wife, from a dearly acquired security .
I'd have thought... but today, a new element prompts me to think the contrary.
Discerning traits: left-handed and extremely stubborn.
He can only be bothered for what is worth his while.
You won't get rid of him.
One day soon, he'll understand that you're mixed up in Margery's clever ruse.
That day, you won't have long to live.
So I come to help you escape from him, to wipe out traces, change your appearance.
All you have to do is obey me meticulously.
You know that I like to work systematically.
We don't deal with dreamers.
They shot at me.
In the middle of town.
They're following me.
They wanted to abduct me.
I fled.
They have...
Margery... has talked.
We have to...
we have to warn the others.
And Anna, where is she?
In a secure place, abroad.
In my pocket.
The more you know about it, the weaker you are.
Leave, now.
Fast!
Nothing... and yet, he wanted to talk with me about his cane.
Do you think he already talked about us?
We'll find out.
Anyway, Chalieff has initiated expeditious action.
He'll go all the way.
I think Margery hasn't yet given away the most important thing.
A chance that Weigelt managed to get his wife out of the country.
There's you, your wife, the embassy... and the concert hall.
That's fun for you, to humiliate me even more?
All this masquerade just now wasn't enough for you.
I don't know any more about it, nothing more!
In the state I'm in, I'd tell you everything.
But even to save my skin, there's nothing more to tell!
Obviously...
Hello, Walter. Yes it's me.
And the other, how is he?
Yes, yes.
Alright.
But I'm calling you about our charming lady friend.
I think... that she can go home.
You heard me right.
Let her go home.
And do you remember what happened to that poor Wolf?
A stupid accident.
- Right, yes.
Exactly.
- No!
Wait...
The director of the concert hall...
They use him as rallying point.
His name?
Erfuhrt.
Erfuhrt.
I start with him, it's the important node.
- What if they came first?
- That'd be a disaster.
And I can't leave anybody behind me.
You Kern, prepare to cross a border in 4th gear when I tell you.
That will help you to save your skin.
For the moment, try to keep your friends here as long as possible.
In case they try to force the door, call the police.
That'll gain some time.
While waiting... try to smile.
Or to invent a new dance, whatever.
- Are you leaving already?
- I have to go.
I'll drop by later, perhaps.
Excuse me, do you know where Mr Erfuhrt is?
We can't keep them here all night.
And tomorrow, I have to go to the beer house.
Kern...
What do you read here?
- An M...
- And like this?
An M upside down...
No... that never was an M.
But a W.
Weigelt.
Yes, Kern.
That's what Margery wanted to tell me.
His cane is at Weigelt's!
We can only go and get it.
But the others may be there already.
- Do you have a revolver?
- Eh...
Yes.
- Did you use it before?
- No.
Master Weigelt...
Bravo.
I'm not of a strong breed.
Yet, a bullet in your belly and you're in shape!
It's a pity for you, but me too.
So, all that, what was it for?
To make me believe that my friend had talked.
I don't know...
I don't know any more.
They have come here.
They've taken Anna.
She's disappeared among them.
Do you know what that means?
A nice girl always finds a way.
Shame on you all!
She doesn't know a thing, she can't talk in her defense.
Her life depends on me.
Only on me!
They've got me.
I obeyed.
Where is she?
They promised me that she'll be back tomorrow at the latest.
You fool...
For her, you gave away Margery and Erfuhrt!
Even though, you're still in the same hole.
It was them or her!
I had no choice.
And how do you contact them, your friends?
The secretary...
They spoke of a transport company at the Giessauf alley.
- Have they kept her over there?
- I don't know.
Kern!
Bring him to me.
Call your boss.
At the transport company.
You'll tell him that there's news.
That Weigelt has documents.
That later, you'll scan them.
You'll explain to him that one of your canes was commuted.
That is was fiddled with.
That it contained a microfilm.
And a small key.
A key to a briefcase.
And you'll tell her that you saw me hang around from your windows.
And that a car just joined you, with 5 or 6 men.
You see, it's simple.
Go on.
You choose...
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, it's Karl.
Hello?
Hello, yes.
Yes, it's altogether by chance.
My eyes caught a cane that I didn't know.
And it was fiddled with.
It contained a microfilm.
And a small key of a briefcase.
Are you sure?
OK, lock the items in your trunk and barricade yourself in your apartment.
Don't worry, we'll be there.
Yes, she's very well.
Shall I take her with me?
Alright.
She'll wait at a distance, in a car.
No, no, that's normal.
I have only my word.
I'll help you still more, but save her, I beg you!
He said that she'll wait a distance, in a car.
That would be easier.
Funny you never talk about Margery...
Do you think it's easy, for him?
Get up, Mr Margery.
Your discretion... wasn't very helpful.
We've found your cane.
The microfilm.
And we've also found... a small key.
You will soon see your friend too... the left-handed.
Hello, police?
Paul...
I've come to look for you.
- My cane...
- It is with me.
- In Paris, you'll tell him...
- To hell with them.
- And you, who are you?
- His friend.
Come on.
- I'm the daughter of Brabant.
- Commander Brabant?
Yes.
I didn't know he had a daughter.
After her accident, my mother became crazy.
Margery took care of me.
In Paris, did they know?
That you worked together, professionally.
No.
For him, I was at hand
He never liked them.
For him, my father died because of a stupid bureaucrat.
He said the less Paris would know about me, the better.
It's a point of view.
I think because of that, Chalieff never even doubted that I knew Margery.
Chalieff told him that he had found the documents in my place, at Weigelt's.
Who did that, have you seen?
Nobody.
Afterwards, he took his life.
Suicide?
Even before you arrived, he was strung out.
We should leave tomorrow morning, after his meeting at the station.
A meeting?
Do you know with who?
I don't know, a certain Hoffmann.
That guy who was supposed to lend him a room.
Ah, Hoffmann.
Do you know him?
Yes.
Does this mean anything to you?
It's a key, to a briefcase.
Do you know why it was important to Margery?
No, I don't know.
It's the first time I hear about it.
You are friends with Ms Kern.
Here.
It was his wallet and what he had on him.
Because he's dead... you can explain it to her better than me.
I will try.
Not all the guests had to leave.
Let her get rid of them, and pack a suitcase.
In a couple of days, I think she could come back.
You, you have nothing left to do here either.
I still have a small favour to ask of you.
Take this.
The information that Margery had to get through to Paris.
It's safer with you than with me, for the moment.
If there's anything wrong, get rid of it.
Right.
In a while, you'll take the Vienna-Rome train.
Wait for me at the first stop after the Italian border.
Meeting at the station lunchroom, from tomorrow noon.
If I'm not there in 3 days, but there's no reason I won't, call Paris, Colbert 23-48.
Ask for Mr Jacques.
- You got it?
- Yes, Colbert 23-48.
You'll say that you have an envelope from me.
He'll come and get you.
Take this.
Thank you.
The employees arrive at 7:30.
The Orient-Express arrives at 7 o'clock.
I only have to mark out the route of your correspondent.
I thought it wasn't the first encounter...
That means that it isn't the same.
Otherwise...
Margery wouldn't have asked me, to mark out...
Yes, obviously.
- Very well.
- Marshal Rommel said:
"There are only 2 kinds of men."
"Those who don't know how to die and those who do."
Margery... knew.
That adorns him.
Mr Margery?
Yes, it's me.
I think it's up to you to open it.
Ah yes.
I checked myself.
Give me the documents and we'll recount together.
I haven't yet... managed to assemble the documents...
How's that?
But you wired that they were ready.
That's what I thought.
- Lack of conscience?
- Not at all.
Did you have reason to complain about the 1st transaction?
No.
Slow wit isn't very useful, we have examples of it.
Everything will become very hard for you.
When the French will find out where they stand with you.
For certain.
Certainty isn't part of this trade, I believe.
I'll bring to your case all the certainty that's needed.
- You?
- Yes, me.
That'd surprise me.
Did you hear? Gunshots.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Did you have to wait long?
- I arrived this morning.
- Did all go well?
- It did, thank you.
Here.
Thank you.
Did you go to Margery's meeting?
Yes.
So, was it important?
I didn't see anybody.
Right... what are you going to do now?
Whatever.
Except what I did before.
I think I'll go to my uncle, in Lausanne.
He has a bookstore.
I'm anxious to see all that again.
To live there...
You're lucky.
My coronel.
- And your friend Margery?
He won't come, he's dead.
- Who?
- Chalieff. Ah.
Yes, ah.
Before he died, he told me to give you this.
- He didn't tell you anything?
- Yes, to tell you many things.
- That's all?
- Yes, that's all.
You're talking to a bounty killer.
I reckon you know what the star stands for. It means I don't need bounty killers around here.
And the reward?
I'll take it.
It goes to a worthy cause.
It goes into your pocket, Sheriff, right?
I'm glad you understand.
Jim!
Your brother just got another one of the bandits, alive! He's looking for you!
Give Margie a kiss for me and get on home!
Two bandits this month, nine in a year. This is the tenth one.
There'll be a celebration.
They didn't have one last time. Bill Slattery was killed. This time the whole town's gonna go wild!
I gotta get going.
There's gonna be a celebration, Margie.
- See you tonight, Margie. - Jim!
- You can make my excuses.
- What'll I say? I don't know.
Dick keep an eye on Jim.
My brother's still just a kid. Don't worry, Bert.
- What are you doing here?
It ain't nice to leave town without saying good-bye to a fellow.
- I'm going with you.
Why aren't you going to White Rock?
Jim, when I was seven years old, our father was murdered and the fellow who did it will be brought to justice.
It's an old score and I want to pay it once and for all. Okay.
Where exactly will we be heading?
No, I'm going alone. He was my Dad too.
It's too much of a risk.
You're too young.
You were younger than I am, when you first caught Sam Guildmore.
Sure you wanna come?
You bet.
- Where will we be heading? - Mexico. Mexico?
Dollars?
Please, one moment.
Yes, the bank is always glad.
Thank you very much.
Do you know anyone called Cisco Delgado?
But I've never met senor Delgado. He's never been to Sierra Mojada.
Now, if the bank can be of any further use to you?
Forward!
Like the entertainment?
It's the way I punish thieves.
You murdered them for stealing?
I may have had other reasons.
That's the way I do things, stranger.
Ask if he knows Cisco Delgado.
He doesn't know him.
Nobody knows him.
Take it easy.
It's powerful stuff.
Firewater.
Tell me, miss, do you know a certain Cisco Delgado?
You didn't answer me. I don't know him.
If you don't remember maybe this will jog your memory!
You didn't have to do that.
He's just a kid.
You're just a kid, too.
Next time, mind your own business.
You staying or leaving?
My boss thinks he can help you.
- Who's this boss of yours?
- Mr. McCloud.
It's a wonderful way to induce perspiration.
I'm sorry, won't you two please sit down?
We don't have much time for visiting.
That's really too bad.
I know that you are Texans.
I don't want you to have to return empty handed.
They tell me you're searching for someone.
I think I recall the name that they mentioned.
Shall we talk?
Yes, that's better.
If I asked you why you were looking for him you'd probably say it was none of my business wouldn't you?
True.
It's Creme de Mente not Firewater.
I prefer to drink mint before lunch. Is that right?
And if I kept asking you exactly why you wanted to see this man you wouldn't tell?
Exactly.
Then I can't help you, despite the fact that I'd really like to.
Why do you want to see Delgado?
Just a minute two gold nuggets.
They have the magic power of granting speech to the mute.
Tell me why you're here.
Then I'll give you a little advice.
Take your brother and go back to Texas.
Stranger, I'm afraid some dirty vermin just stole your horses.
Breaks my heart.
Mine, too.
Texas is back there!
Is that some kind of a hint?
No, it's an order.
According to the laws of this territory, the mayor has the power not to admit or expel any or all strangers considered undesirable to the state.
The mayor is right here.
That fellow is the lawyer and you two are the undesirable.
What do you mean?
We haven't done anything.
What is your name, boy?
Jim Sullivan, and this is my brother, Bert.
Bert, you'd better tell your brother, and tell him right away what happens when a stranger gets too curious.
Wait. I need to talk to you.
No one will see us down here.
Suits me.
I'm sorry about what just happened.
In this part of Mexico, there's no law, there's no order only anarchy and the total oppression of mercenary interests of merciless tyranny and uncontrolled power.
So I've found out.
Exactly. You've seen it.
And all because we're afraid of one all-powerful man.
Who is he?
They could be following us.
Tell me where I can find him.
I don't know anything about that.
Wait, don't go. Stay here and help us.
We're planning to rebel against Delgado.
You two are Americans, you are both free!
You've been through this already.
You understand. Will you give us help?
I'd like to, I really would but I'm in too much of a hurry to wait for a revolution.
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Thanks, Mr. Sullivan.
You drink too much, Miguel.
It's time too stop.
Don't tell me what to do.
About them two foreigners if you want me to, I could arrange a little accident.
That's something I'll do.
Adios, Miguel.
Are you tired?
Bert, when you were sheriff, didn't you try to catch your criminals alive?
This ain't White Rock
If you're afraid, you'd better turn around and go home.
He's trying to run us down!
That's the first time you ever killed any one, ain't it? Yeah.
You'll get used to it.
Please, come with me.
This dollar belongs to you.
Are you still interested in knowing about Delgado?
Yes, of course.
The horse is all yours.
Didn't make it? Next time, maybe.
You keep an eye on the horses, let me take care of the girls.
If I tell you where Delgado is, it will cost you six dollars plus four for my trouble, that makes it ten.
The girl is included in that for free.
In the mountains, there's a little hut near the trail that leads to Traherra where we'll find a shepherd named Manuel Hernandez.
He'll talk.
I hope so.
I can't understand it, Cisco.
Old Antonio there, refuses to sell us his land.
Bad Antonio.
I want that land. And I want it right away.
- Good morning, Cisco.
What have you got, McCloud?
It's the collection for the month, with the cash for those twenty girls and the thirty crates of rifles.
The alcohol's on another bill.
Keep talking.
The land near Coberta wasn't producing so I sold it.
The settlers of Tahona refused to pay.
I had to punish them for that.
I'll take care of the punishing around here.
Do you want your sons to die?
It will be on your head.
Cisco!
A couple of strangers were in Sierra Mojada yesterday, looking for you.
Did you find out who they were?
They're the sons of Jack Sullivan.
I tried to send them back where they came from, but they wouldn't go.
But don't worry about it.
Leave them alone!
Where are they now?
The path near Traherra.
There's someone down here.
Yeah, there's someone.
Whoever it is, is dead.
It's the girl from the tavern.
I knew we'd see each other again, Yankee.
God did not listen to me even though I prayed.
Now, I want you boys to bury the girl.
Make the grave big enough for you and your brother.
You might need it.
While I'm at it, I'll make it big enough for all of you.
That seem strange to you?
What?
Why didn't they try to kill us?
They had plenty of chances.
I don't know.
What do you want?
Are you Manuel Hernandez?
Arkita told us the way here.
Where is Cisco Delgado?
Wait.
It's not enough.
Another.
It's enough.
All right.
Come on.
Those are Delgado's prisoners.
Go with them but don't ask any questions.
Juan, Juan, It's us!
Bring her out!
Come on you!
No! Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Take your hands off me!
Let go of me!
You dirty killers!
You're just a bunch of filthy murderers!
Stay where you are! Make one false move, God help me, I'll shoot you!
Now get out of that wagon!
You're free! Go, you're free! Get down!
All of you!
You're acting like a fool!
What are you gonna do about it, Bert?
We've got other work to do, boy.
Put them in with the others!
And give them a bath!
And you two come with me!
Where's Delgado?
Didn't they tell you not to ask any more questions?
Yeah.
Then you'd better take their advice.
He's gonna wait here.
I've been expecting you, Bert Sullivan.
You know why I'm here, don't you?
It's taken you a pretty long time to get here.
You're going back to Texas.
You've got a score to settle with the law and I'll see it gets paid.
I've come a long way since I left Texas.
Land, money, this house a name that's feared all over Mexico.
Do you expect me to leave all of this behind because you are blind enough to confuse revenge with justice?
You killed my father.
That's not a good enough reason for me to give myself up to you.
I'm taking you back with me, Cisco.
No! You're going back alone!
I'll give you a chance to get out.
Where's Jim?
Why do you want to know?
Jim is my son.
You were a kid when I was there.
I wish it had never happened.
I couldn't forget her.
Not even after she died.
I didn't come back for Jim because I knew he was with you and would grow up to be honest respected, without the taint of being a criminal's son.
It wasn't an easy thing to do.
It was a sacrifice. All the same, I did it and I'm not sorry!
I did it for his sake and now you've bought him here to show him what his father's like.
I never wanted him to find out what his father really was.
I hope you're satisfied.
Well?
Follow me.
She's pretty.
Dance.
It's your party. Go ahead.
The party's for you, too.
Why don't you think better than any of my men.
I'd pay a lot to a man like you.
There's a job here if you want it.
We're going back tomorrow.
Really?
I'll give you money. Enough money to last you for the rest of your life.
You can do that in Texas.
You're coming back.
That's where you're wrong.
Dead wrong!
Just who the hell do you think you are?
My judge? Well, you aren't and I'm not gonna take it!
Your father was nothing but a cheap bandit and your mother a harlot!
I said, this girl here is mine.
That's all!
Go on, get out!
It was because of the girl. He's the one who started it.
Sure, Jim.
Leave us alone.
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.
Take your hands off me, you murderer!
Lock him up!
You had your chance and you didn't take it.
I'm turning him over to you.
Show him that I mean business.
Give Miguel what's left of him. I want him taken to the Texas boundary.
Good-bye, Bert.
Greetings from Cisco, Miguel.
He wants you to take the American back to Texas again.
What did I tell you? You are undesirable.
You wait for me outside.
You push this one on the floor and I'm gonna break your arm.
Why is he treating me like this?
That's something I wouldn't mind finding out myself.
Calm down.
You get out of my way.
Open it.
And look inside it.
It's your mother's.
We knew each other.
Don't look at me like that.
How did you know my mother?
Answer me!
How did you know my mother?
You are my son.
Take it!
What's the matter?
You don't want to talk? I understand.
There is one thing, pray!
I wouldn't feel so bad about leaving this country.
- Hello, Sullivan. - Howdy!
What's this?
A bunch of lousy revolutionaries?
And a pretty poor bunch at that.
Your men can't shoot straight enough to knock off my hat.
Are there enough men?
For what?
To eliminate Cisco Delgado.
Idiots!
Stupid idiots!
You can't stop Cisco!
Are you tired of living? Yes.
Under these conditions, who wouldn't be tired of living?
Do me a favor, stranger.
Pray for all of us.
You once stood for justice and liberty.
My father told me that you lost your wife and your sons because you stood up to Delgado
Why don't you join us?
It's too late now.
What about you, Sullivan? Will you help us?
I wish you luck.
Your gun.
Your gun.
What do you want it for?
You heard what Fernandez said.
I heard that Cisco has your brother in prison. I'm sorry.
You're very brave to try and fight.
I admire Fernandez. He's a man you can trust. He has the courage to die.
Good-bye, stranger.
Hurry! Come on!
There's no one on guard!
Come on!
No, you don't!
You shouldn't have tried that.
I'm warning you. Get ready for an attack!
Fernandez is leading a group of revolutionaries!
They're coming here!
- And what about Bert?
I haven't heard anything.
Pedro, I want the men here at once, and all of them ready to go.
They're trapped at the end of the valley!
Here I am.
Did you change your mind or did you finally decide not to take on Delgado alone?
I came to tell you that you'd better get ready for an attack.
- An attack?
How many out there? I'm not sure.
But they'll have reinforcements this time.
It's going to be a really old-time battle on horseback.
Come along and help us.
I reckon you know a lot about the law, but we're not in a courthouse. We're unprotected now.
Get down!
Didn't you hear Mr. Sullivan?
Get off your horses!
When they get to that point in the road, give the signal to fire we'll take them by surprise. The rifle!
Thank you, Sullivan.
Stay where you are, Bert!
And put down that pistol.
Until now, I had nothing against you. But you made me want to kill you.
I will kill you because you hate me so.
You have a reason to hate me but not my own son!
Is that you, Bert?
I can't see you.
Listen to me...
When you, when you get to Texas can you hear me?
Texas good-bye.
All right, let's get moving.
We've got a long road ahead of us, Cisco.
We're going back to Texas.
We're going back to Texas.

- As a student...
- Watch it, or we'll punch you up.
As a student I sold myself to the state! Now, I'll choose my buyer.
The State's not so disgusting!
Who drives the nice cars? People like us?
I can't bear to look at those success men, their cars, their girls...
Wy can't I have all that now?
Must I wait until I'm old to get such a car, such a girl?
I'll gladly give my life for my country when I'm 5O.
In our cynical and unidealistic generation in spite of everything, romantic impulses manifest themselves.
Win something by your own youthful efforts, fight for something!
Even for cars and girls, but not a pension at your age!
You've had 15 years of education and you can't do one more year?
You've deprived someone of a place!
Yes, it's disgusting!
I've broken down.
Should I cry? So I broke down.
But who's driving the good cars? Men like us?
First see who they were before they got those cars.
Defend yourself, wonder boy!
They want something from you!
We were four...
He's gone!
Now, we are three.
I don't have to play.
Take my money as a grant.
From me!
We don't know our individual contributions from the first year.
How can we share out?
It's a lot, we must play for it.
Winer takes all!
I want one thing clear. If I win the piggy it's ours - common property.
And you?
Do you play for all or yourself?
Don't be shy!
If I win I'll take the lot!
I play for all.
Untie me.
Untie me...
let me say goodbye to you.
Untie me.
Feet off!
My bed!
See, I want a bed of my own, to trample on.
Not state property!
All my belongings go into this suitcase.
In 1 O years you'll met to compare your purchases.
That'll be your biography!
In 1 O years you'll arrive where I am now.
I'm sparing myself 1 O years gradual disillusion surrender of ambition, of ideals...
Another word and I'll smash you!
In our cynical and unidealistic generation... in spite of everything
romantic impulses manifest themselves.
We ought to join the bloodstream of society!
You'll smash me?
Multiwitamin - to soothe your jangling nerves!
Here, take the pack!
- And when they explode think...
- Of you lot?
No, what a bum you are!
At last you'll be able to lie and look at the ceiling.
Aim well!
BECOME A BLOOD DONOR
Fellow students!
You know what blood is and why you should be the first to give it so that you give aid even before you qualify as doctors!
The last week of the Lent is also Blooddonor Week!
You're the first volunteer.
Please, appeal to the others.
Christ gave his blood and life!
Give blood at least!
- Not this door!
- But here I...
Oh, it's you! Yes, he's here.
I'm getting married.
- Got a pen?
- Father, I'm getting married tomorrow.
Wipe your face.
Seal it.
You've been up too long today.
Do you need anything?
Now I'll have...
Deliver it today.
See that it's opened in your presence.
I don't need anything...
I have television.
I broke down.
Can anyone else do better?
Are you a student?
Why have you come so late?
Put it away somewhere.
You must start at this end.
The steel wool.
I took you for a student, but you didn't say...
- It's a joke.
- Please don't do any more.
Some students were to do the clearing, you can't rely on anything.
Now, just let me think...
I don't know if I can tell which one it is.
Look for yourself.
There's only one, very old, tsarist.
Judge?
My dear Judge please take the cards from Father's hands and let him grip the receiver instead.
To a dance?
But it's Easter Saturday.
Well, yes, I suppose it's all right after midnight.
Other side of the bridge?
Oh, At the new place! That'll be marvellous!
Will it be open?
Listen, someone's come here from the onsign the one At the pensioners' home.
He worked it out exactly he's returned the loan plus the interest, 3OO exactly.
Perhaps you would prefer to hale cash instead?
More than the repayment, of course.
Five hundred?
- Six hundred?
- Now I begin to understand.
It's supposed to be a present to me on the occasion...
- I'll ring back.
There's a dentist next door - take no notice.
Why such a face?
We've got a buyer for it, haven't we?
There's some dirt on your face... there, too...
You should wash.
You'll find it, all will come off with this.
Best of all, take a bath.
You'll have time to think about the sabre...
I know what your game is!
But I'm in love, I'm getting married!
What do you think you're playing at, switching off the lights?
I haven't, there's a power failure.
How dare you take a handle from there?
Maybe he deserves it!
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, but I haven't any matches.
There's an easier way.
It'll lose its temper, it'll break, you'll see.
Now, what will you do?
The snow was my idea.
It's smouldering!
Those in favour, raise their candles!
Tank you!
Those against!
Please, miss!
You know that place the other side of the bridge?
The New place?
Well, we could play a joke on my friends from the Academy...
I'm pretending that I'm getting married tomorrow.
Now I have to meet them there with my fiancee.
Wouldn't it be funny if I showed them you?
After all you could be my fiancee.
We could go to that place together.
But I haven'f finished work yet.
But wait a moment, won't you?
- Still up, sisters?
- We're waiting for the resurrection.
Room 512 please.
Come and meet my fiancee.
I'm sitting here, feeling rather stupid.
At that place they won't let you into without a tie.
I'll fetch her now.
Telephone for you.
How do you like her?
What?
What have you told her?
They've allerted us, like an emergency service.
So that someone who loses faith, like a leg can find first aid here.
- I'm going to wait.
- Waiting costs money, too!
They wait, they get drunk, and what can we do about it?
- I'm waiting for money, in a suitcase.
- That's worth waiting for.
I want to make an impression, but I don't know about wines.
For 5O I'll call you Councellour, 1 OO Chief, 2OO Chairman, 5OO Minister.
- One hundred.
Dirty!
Clean!
You have a chance to give me a good start.
It's my first day.
You are alone, you need friendship.
All the better if I could be Her...
The Girl Friend.
You'll discover everything here for a single zloty.
A Slave.
I love my husband very much but we've just quarrelled,
I told him I've had enough of him and we haven't spoken for a week.
I don't know how it will end, yet nothing...
All in good repair, like the one beginning a new life!
He means me.
Sir, I used to come here... and drink drops from the glasses, but now I have a wage!
Sir, I have a profession, a secure existence.
Got a cigarette?
It's a special cigarette...
the last!
Ladies and gentlemen, all of us are in the best of moods!
Those not here yet will arrive soon!
Lent ends at midnight.
We'll all have a good time!
Here's the famous...
And here's the one beginning a new life!
Well, who else?
Our star!
Ladies and gentlemen, our star!
She's not quite ready, she's still in her bath!
Ladies and gentleman, you can hear the splashing!
Something specially for us?
No, I can't, I haven't finished this yet.
We understand, the star isn't quite ready... but a little something?
Please, leave me alone, I'm tired.
It must be very tiring, we know - but please, just for us!
Turn around, drop your mask
Retreat! To those days!
When you could have been God knows where!
When you could have been God knows who!
Now he, after evil days...
Or after something like youth...
Or love...
With hand to throat he wants to begin again!
Longs again to be God knows who!
With hand to throat he wants to begin again!
Longs again to be God knows who!
And he straightens his tie
I put snow in but it still smoulders.
- What was that?
- Some cabaret numer.
I put snow in because I couldn't open it.
- It's not worth putting out.
- Why carry it then?
To be different from those who carry briefcases.
But you were afraid I might go off with it, weren't you?
- Smells like a good cygar, Chief.
- It's a suitcase.
But a good one, Chief!
Ah, money has arrived!
Allow me, Madame... your fur.
Was it a time bomb?
No... a piece of cake fell inside.
They think you're mad!
Would it help to get the lady blind... with our field glasses?
No, champagne when everyone is here.
- As a clou.
- As a what?
It stopped mouldering.
Serve it at the end, with a knife.
As a clou!
- And what now?
- Change the tablecloth.
And then?
The usual.
I understand, Chief.
The bums are drinking away their piggy bank!
The usual thing? We are not regulars.
We'll give ourselves away if we don't do better than that!
Dont't worry, I'll lend you some, if your piggy runs out.
I could be dressed for clearing the car. Do we have one?
- What's that?
- A clean cloth.
We have more than a car!
The first for the gate... the second for the villa... the third for the... garage.
The fourth for the car door... the fifth for ignition...
- The sixth?
- I've forgotten.
How come?
I clean carpets in villas - here's one of the moths.
Show me. You could wash trains.
One of our crowd married a Frenchman.
What is a Frenchman?
We don't say an engeneer or a driver form France
- just a Frenchman!
She doesn't know his job, she can't converse with him.
Or take his story, for instance.
Lately my life has ceased to be a nightmare.
Why stare?
Because I haven't made good?
Where does it say everyone has to make good?
How could you stoop to this in your prime?
It was going to rain...
I was deep in thought...
And suddenly someone put into my hand... two zlotys.
A slight difference of gesture and what a consequence...
Sir, I'll make a fortune out of this!
Please, as a token of gratitude!
Sir, you're bound to buy it in this shape!
It's them - don't look!
Now I'll tell you what they said on the phone.
They're coming to smash your face in.
- Afraid, Mister?
- Drop the formalities!
Afraid?
- Two beers.
- And invite him.
Chief?
Hide your boots under the table!
Please, get my shoes from my fur.
Cheaply dressed, but reeks of money!
I'll smash him now!
I really love her! Isn't she magnificent?
Would you love her without her money?
We met on a tram, love at first sight.
- You travel by tram?
- Occasionally.
- Don't be cynical!
- There was a questionnaire:
Your greatest day dream!
I said I dreamt of a record.
At least of Opel Rekord.
But our car is better than a Rekord, eh?
I prefer an engine's roar to a thudding heart!
I'm more interested in cylinder valves than diseased mitrais.
What a ham!
Are you so much of a swine?
You want to gain 1 O years of life' you'll lose 1 O years of youth!
Come on, let's be sociable.
Let's dance.
I can't.
Your boots show them it's untrue.
What's true and what isn't?
Everything's untrue.
Only it's a pity we haven't time to fall in love.
Everybody had to buy one!
Seven hundred!
For the sabre.
Eight hundred!
They paid for the beer.
And salt to tell you they'd smash Chief's face anyway!
Where are you going?
- Defend yourself!
- Hallo!
Divorced yet?
Defend yourself first!
- Divorced! And you?
- Getting married!
What if she had long fingers?
These youngsters are driving licences but not cars!
The older you get the more you need money!
Portrait photos are out!
Now it's Jesuses!
I enter a cottage and find a space on the wall.
All I say is, blessed by Christ".
Then a quick nail in the wall and it's hanging up!
Then I ask for 35O zloties.
Then the peasant drags me to see the dozens he's got already!
So I take mine down saying , they don't want you Jesus".
Even atheists fall for that.
I hang it back and pocket the cash.
Disasters are profitable for exhibitions.
You know: Art!
Know what she was shouting?
Help!
Know this trick for picking up girls?
What a headache!
Have you got an aspirin?
- If you get angry, you'll spoil the fun.
- The fun is over!
Do you know that man?
He's gone.
Where do you live? Why?
Let's say:
The young tramworkers' hostel.
What would our love be like?
Walks on frosty days... student dances...
Do you know him?
- He's looking at you!
- Take it easy!
I'll qualify and be sent to work where there are no trams.
- Who is he?
- My husband.
So what?
Is he too short?
Too old? Not prepossessing enough?
- He looks as if he had to buy you...
- What do you know? What, he was in the war?
Propellers were not made to cool drunks!
They can make up their own biographies, war heroes...
I'm three years short of pretence!
At seven you could throw a molotov cocktail - not at four!
That's him!
No, it isn't!
How can one tell war heroes apart?
My father's like the one who sells Girlfriend.
He was wonderful, but after the war...
Sometimes I wisit my father, he's a pensioner.
He bought back that sabre. He wanted to give me something that... Every sixth man died in the war.
They have their songs.
What are ours? "I'll manage by myself?"
You are like this when you are young! Full like this bottle!
And you shake it. You shake it, and it bubbles and churns inside you. And then...
Remember, you'll die one day and you won't be resurected!
Excuse me, they brought someone in the ambulance...
- What name?
- Not long ago...
- Particulars!
- Girlfriend!
- Was it someone close to you?
- Wy do you say, was it"?
Her father?
- I want to be a blood donor!
- Sorry, I think you've just left a bar.
Come back after you've slept it off.
That's the sort of blood donor we get.
Let's look down on it all.
- On what?
- My students' hostel.
There'll be a dance there this afternoon.
I'll wait for you at the entrance at 5 o'clock.
You're so romantic because it's down and high up.
O geese! You get fat and lose birds' ambition to fly. Geese!
I understand you.
Tell me how things are with you, where do you really live?
There, where the dog barks.
I'll probably marry, because I need a home.
Man built this to detach himself from earth for a few seconds.
Mount!
Where's the boss?
I want this tram in service, do you hear?
That's no concern of mine, thank you.
It's dawn, you are on the afternoon shift and you say it's nothing?
So what is it?
- Maybe I could do now...
- And this afternoon?
It's no concern of mine, but you must have a reason.
And you say it's nothing!
Easter holiday schedule - what if someone lets me down?
Who can I count on?
Try to change with someone, but I want your tram in service.
I got up early, and getting up is the worst part.
If I change shift with you, I'll have to get up again.
You said you love me' take my turn.
- Don't love me?
- Won't take your turn!
Is it important?
Take my turn?
Have I ever asked you to do anything for me?
It's a good thing you're here - you can help us.
We've been working on it all night.
Will you help?
DEAD
Quite an echo, eh?
Do you want a certificate to get off work?
You were talking about me last night.
Yes, you were.
- I said you were my husband.
- Undress, then.
Nothing's wrong.
I have to write something here.
You... I've never examined you!
Come on, undress.
I won't look.
- I only said it to annoy him.
- Well, undress.
Ah, you love him!
- He's getting married today.
- So, why the certificate?
He might not.
You need a fortune-teller, not me!
He loves me, he loves me not...
Shall I undress?
I once had to deal with a girl who fell under the tram.
She'd hobbled herself tied red ribbon around her knees so as to walk gracefully!
When the tram came she forgot she could not run.
I must look into your eyes!
Yes, nothing's wrong!
The examination is concluded.
I know you switch duty to be here during my shift.
A cat crossed my path on the way here.
So I said to the cat...
You, cat, why do you cross my path?
And he replied...
No, he didn't he just drew back.
You see, the cat understood, but not you!
Here, you won't have to go to work.
I don't suppose I'll meet him anyway.
- Then go to work.
- Then I certainly won't meet him
You'll met him, you won't!
You love him, you don't.
Cat!
All I can do is give you a certificate.
When we were falling asleep in the minefields this is what I used to do to keep awake...
I'll be watching recede into the distance where there'll be someone else ...receding from you!
- What is it?
- Terminus!
Can you spare a moment, sir?
I have... four minutes.
That's enough.
There should be a wall...
My execution...
If you can't see, why have a watch?
Only two and half minutes!
That's all you can spare for us who were ready to suffer execution for you.
Now, I've a better chance with you than a blind man.
Perhaps it's better that I'm alive, can see, can...
Colleagues! ...romantic impulses still manifest themselves!
She was late and now wants to run him down!
He may be here! What's his surname?
I don't know!
His name?
His first name?
What year is he in?
Which faculty?
Surely you know his college?
Which seat?
Then I don't know.
He had a sabre!
Get up, or you'll catch cold!
NARRATOR: This yacht is bringing a revolutionary invention to Gotham.
On a peaceful motor ride, millionaire Bruce Wayne and his ward, Dick Grayson, have been summoned to Wayne Manor by an urgent but anonymous call for help.
The invention and its custodian are reported in grave danger aboard the yacht.
Never ones to shirk responsibility Bruce and Dick, with characteristic speed and resolve descend promptly to the Batcave.
And then, as they have done many times before as Batman and Robin, courageous warriors against crime they are off, once again, to the rescue.
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Roger.
Ready to move out.
BatmobiIe to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.
BatmobiIe approaching.
MAN:
Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all aircraft in the control zone.
Enter your holding pattern. Batcopter cleared for takeoff.
It's good to know they`re up there doing their job.
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.
Roger.
Correcting to port.
Altitude: 31 7.
Sink rate: 0.49.
-Drop Bat ladder.
-Bat ladder away.
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic BathoId.
Watch out.
This could be tricky.
Have no fear. I'Il keep all my wits about me. So long, for a minute.
Batman to Robin, ease off on the power!
Increase sink rate!
Roger!
WiIco!
Take her up!
Holy sardine!
Hand me down the shark-repelIent Bat spray!
GORDON:
Enough pictures. BATMAN: This must be brief.
O'HARA: You're lucky they`ll talk. -Mr.
Merrick of The Gotham city Times.
A yacht approaching the city is said to have disappeared.
-Nonsense.
How can a yacht disappear?
-It isn't true?
I stand on my answer.
Mr. stanley of The Globe.
-It was a Big Ben Distilleries yacht?
Isn't the proprietor, Commodore Schmidlapp bringing with him a new invention from Big Ben`s lab?
-No more questions about that ship.
-What about that shark?
BATMAN: Unfortunately, it chanced to swallow a floating mine.
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss--
Comrade Kitanya lrenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff.
From The Moscow Bugle.
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?
Please, take off the mask to give the better picture.
-Batman take off his mask?
O'HARA: She's mad.
BATMAN: Chief O'Hara, all of you.
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural however, impossible to grant.
-Impossible?
-Indeed.
If we were to remove our masks, our true identities would be revealed.
-Ruining their value as crime fighters.
-Not even we know who they are.
In fact, our own relatives don't know.
But your so curious costumes....
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we`re ordinary Americans.
You`re like the masked vigilantes in the Westerns?
Batman and Robin are deputized agents of the law!
-"Support your police" is our message.
-well said, Robin.
And no better way to end this conference.
-Thank you and good day. MAN:
Batman--
O'HARA: Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.
A fine job.
You alIayed their fears.
If l`d told the truth, panic would grip the city.
The truth.
And what is the truth?
A decoy.
An anonymous warning that Schmidlapp's in danger, to lure me into a trap.
An attempt on his life.
While they were luring you to a watery grave the yacht was being hijacked?
-Precisely!
-And who behind it?
What known super criminals are at large now?
I'Il check at once, Batman.
Let's have the latest status report on criminals at large. Thank you.
Coming up on the closed-circuit TV screen.
MAN: Status report. Known super criminals not currently imprisoned.
BATMAN: Penguin.
That pompous waddIing master of foul play maestro of a million criminal umbrellas.
robin:
Joker! O'HARA: Clown prince of crime!
If I had a nickel for every time he baffled us!
GORDON: The Riddler too?
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.
robin: Gosh, and the Catwoman!
-End of status report.
Could be any one of them, but which one?
Which ones?
Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder.
-Where there's a fish, there`s Penguin.
-Wait! It happened at sea.
See? `'C`' for Catwoman!
Yet, that exploding shark was pulling my leg.
-The Joker!
-It all adds up to a sinister riddle.
Riddler. RiddIer?
A thought strikes me.
So dreadful I scarcely dare give it utterance.
The four of them.
Their forces combined.
-Holy nightmare!
-Batman, could it be?
I don`t know.
But I think I know where to find a clue.
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!
Ahoy, Catwoman.
How many times have I told you?
Never use my real name in public!
You and your trained exploding shark!
How should I know they`d have a can of shark-repelIent Bat spray?
You pompous puffed-up penguin!
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!
Sic them, Hecate, scratch out their eyes.
-Take away that ravenous panther!
-I'll feed him to the birds.
I'Il incapacitate it with my trick confetti!
"United Underworld.`' We`re about as united as the members of the United world headquarters.
-What's the matter with you all?
-She`s right.
If we don`t manage to swallow our super-criminaI pride--
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!
We must hang together, or we shall hang separately.
What a pity that would be on the eve of the greatest criminal coup ever!
-How did it go, Catwoman?
-Perfectly. Perfectly.
In my disguise as Kitka, I penetrated their press conference.
-The fools are completely baffled.
-But undrowned.
Yes, unfortunately.
Batman's boots didn`t even look damp!
Our prisoner still doesn't know he's kidnapped?
He just keeps ringing for his tea.
[BELL RINGS]
-There he goes again. penguin:
Take it to him, man.
Come in.
Your tea, commodore.
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.
Are you getting enough sea air?
My duties keep me mostly undercover.
Too bad.
How much longer will this yacht be fogbound off the Grand Banks?
I couldn't say, sir.
well, gives me a chance to catch up on my Dickens.
still, l`d like to get to Gotham City.
I've a clever invention with me, stored down in the hold.
Should be worth millions of dollars, pip-pip!
well, pip-pip to you, sir!
If you wish anything further, just ring!
Schmidlapp`s invention in our hands the whole world almost literally in our grasp!
And Batman and Robin still alive to block us.
Everything pip-pip with the prisoner!
Hasn't a clue.
-I bet the Dynamic Duo has.
-What?
A clue on how we made that ship disappear.
-And when they solve it--
-They`ll be out to investigate.
But we'Il be there first.
If we hurry, that is.
Catwoman, you tend to this headquarters.
-Attention, you unfathomable finks!
-Yo-ho!
call down to our secret river-bottom dock.
-Prepare our submarine for sea.
-Yo-ho!
-Yo-ho what?
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.
BATMAN: My hunch was right.
-I don't get it--
Think!
As you remarked, no one can make a seagoing vessel simply disappear.
Provided it was ever really there at all.
-You mean--?
-Precisely!
The yacht we thought we saw was a mere illusion.
A tricky projection akin to the common desert mirage.
It deceived our naked eyes but was blocked by the Batcamera's Batfilter!
I know where that projection came from.
-Observe that bell buoy.
robin:
The coordinates of our position were 1 0.3 by 69-B.
Feed those figures into the navigational aid computer. Roger.
No legal bell buoy at that position.
As I surmised, an illegal projection buoy cleverly camouflaged.
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!
-One thing I don't dig, Batman. -Oh?
If that ship was a mirage, where`s the real one?
Taken to some secret island hideaway with every soul aboard, save one.
-Commodore SchmidIapp?
-Precisely.
For some reason the hijackers needed him or his invention as part of their criminal scheme.
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.
It looks like we`ve got the whole ocean to ourselves.
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard, three degrees.
Hoist three degrees.
I hope you know what you're doing, Penguin.
Mr. RiddIer, I ignore your insipid insinuation, sir!
Mr. Joker, you're leaning on the control!
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!
As the poet says:
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"
Now hear this.
This is your captain speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.
We`re approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!
MAN:
Yo-ho!
-What? What?
Unidentified small craft, bearing 1 1 3.
Mr. BIuebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.
BATMAN: Watch your step, Robin.
An underwater shark cage.
The source of that fish.
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!
Nothing`s sacred to those devils.
Torpedoes!
What are we waiting for?
Chain of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.
Mr. Joker. Load the torpedo tubes!
Yo-ho!
Load torpedo tubes!
Salt and corrosion.
The infamous old enemies of the crime fighter.
No prints here.
Look here, Batman.
That tricky mirage projector must be behind this plate.
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
No wonder we were fooled.
Look, Robin.
robin: Holy Long John silver!
A periscope!
He spotted us!
Set torpedoes to automatic homing.
Set torpedoes to automatic homing!
You crazy bird.
Fire them off, quickly!
Activate the remote control Penguin magnet inside that buoy. Yo-ho!
Holy glue pot!
What's going on?
The fiends!
They`ve converted this buoy into a gigantic magnet!
It's got us by the metallic objects in our utility belts.
Torpedo tubes armed!
Batman! We`re helpless in this monstrous, invisible grip!
-Steady, Robin. I see one hope.
-What, Batman?
If I could just pry loose my utility belt transmitter!
-Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire?
-Yo-ho, ready to fire!
Five, four, three, two.
-Fire 1 !
Torpedoes!
If I can just reverse the polarity, send out waves of super energy.
-What happened?
-Mr. Joker, fire 2!
Here comes another one!
You and your reconditioned surplus torpedoes!
He must be using a super energy reverse polarizer!
Mr. joker, fire 3!
Fire 3!
Here comes a third one!
Confound it, the batteries are dead!
This one's getting through!
It is. It`s getting through.
Surface, Mr. BIuebeard!
Let us feast our eyes on the watery remains!
Gosh, the nobility of the almost-human porpoise.
True, Robin.
It was noble of that animal to hurl himself into the path of that torpedo.
He gave his life for ours.
Operator, give me the Pentagon, Navy department.
Too bad.
Admiral FangschIiester's office.
hello, Batman speaking.
-Who is it?
-Batman.
hello, Batman.
Ahoy!
What can I do for you?
hello, admiral. A routine question.
Have you recently sold surplus submarines? If so, to whom?
Just a moment, I'Il have to look that up.
Keep practicing.
Answer: affirmative.
We disposed of a surplus submarine on Friday.
A pre-atomic model.
To some chap named P.N. Gwynne.
-P.N. Gwynne?
-The Penguin!
Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address?
Just a post office box number.
Would you like it?
No, thank you, admiral.
You`ve been very helpful.
Your tone sounds grim.
We haven't done anything foolish?
Disposing of submarines to persons who don`t even leave their addresses?
-Good day, admiral.
-Gosh!
The Penguin in command of a pre-atomic submarine!
-Grave situation, Robin. -If only we knew what he was up to!
[RUMBLING]
Holy polaris!
From that submarine, no doubt.
That missile, it's written something.
robin: A riddle, in the form of a joke!
Let's race back to headquarters.
You know what this means, don`t you?
Our fear is confirmed.
Penguin, Joker, Riddler, their forces combined.
-Heaven only knows the objective!
-It may be worse. Worse?
-Saints alive, how can that be?
-Look at this pair of riddles.
"What does a turkey do when he flies upside down?"
-He gobbles up. -Of course.
-And number two.
"What weighs 6 ounces, sits in a tree and is dangerous? `'
-A sparrow with a machine gun.
-Of course.
Now, combine both answers.
What kind of creature would gobble up a bird in a tree?
Heaven protect us, a cat!
Yes, the criminal catalyst in this entire affair our old archenemy, Catwoman.
Penguin, joker, Riddler and Catwoman too!
The sum of the angles of that rectangle is monstrous.
We`ve been given warning.
They work to take over--
-Gotham City?
-Any two of them might try that!
-The whole country?
-If it were three, l`d say yes.
But four? Their minimum objective must be the entire world.
CATWOMAN: The United World building, comrades.
Our objective, the Security council.
Sitting like fat birds in a tree just waiting to be snatched.
And you bungled it!
The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap!
Passing porpoises which intercept torpedoes!
There ought to be a piscatorial statute!
Time is short!
We`ve got to get Batman before he gets us.
I could lure him into a giant exploding octopus--
After one of your fishy explosions, they`re still in one piece.
I suppose they`lI be broken up by your moldy jokes!
Shut up, all of you!
I see the way to do it.
We`lI play each of our treacherous trumps in one hand.
And we`lI do it right here!
-How?
-How?
The end.
The end of....
We shall spring them from the Joker's jack-in-the-box through that window, out over the sea and into the waiting arms of the Penguin's exploding octopus!
The trigger?
One of my riddles.
And the bait?
You, Catwoman.
You`re mad.
The minute Batman spots her he'Il bop her with a Batarang.
You don't understand.
She will be disguised as Kitka.
And as Kitka, she shall lure some millionaire into a kidnap trap.
Of course!
With a clever clue pointing here.
-Batman will race to the rescue.
But who are we going to kidnap?
I know the perfect victim.
I know the perfect victim!
I know!
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head of that disgusting do-gooding Wayne Foundation.
Delicious!
Just the sort of square citizen Batman will dash to rescue.
-Then snap!
-Into the combination trap.
Perfect, RiddIer, perfect.
Comrade Wayne?
My name is Kitanya Irenya Tatanya Karenska AIisoff.
i`m from The Moscow Bugle.
My friends call me Kitka.
Kitka.
Kitka, a charming acronym.
Thank you, Comrade Wayne.
The Wayne Foundation is known from Leningrad to Kamchatka.
It works for peace and understanding.
Your picture has appeared countless times in The Moscow Bugle.
I'm most grateful, I wasn't aware of that.
You found these riddles on Wayne Foundation stationery under your door?
Yes, Comrade Wayne.
That`s why I brought them to you.
I thought it was some foolishness, then I remembered: Is there not a bourgeois criminal cad the Riddler, who preys upon the workers?
Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka.
But there is such a creature.
What do we do now?
Report these riddles to your police or perhaps to that Cossack Batman?
That`s hardly necessary at the moment.
Doubtless it`s the work of some harmless crank.
Nevertheless, shall we give this matter further consideration over dinner tonight?
What a perfectly lovely idea.
I'Il telephone to cancel a previous engagement.
Alfred will see you to the door.
Do vechera.
Do vechera, Comrade Wayne.
Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please.
Meet me in the Batcave.
Emergency.
Very good, sir.
Listen to these riddles.
tell me if you interpret them as I do.
-"What has yellow skin and writes?"
-A ballpoint banana.
Right. `'What people are always in a hurry? `'
Rushing people?
Russians!
Right again.
What would you say they mean?
Banana, Russian....
A Russian will slip on a banana peel and break their neck!
precisely, the only possible meaning.
-A clear threat to Miss Kitka's life.
-Who?
Miss Kitka, the charming Russian journalist for The Moscow Bugle.
In some way she must have unwittingly stumbled on the criminals' plot!
What is the scheme?
Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out on the town with Miss Kitka.
-A not displeasing chore.
-Indeed.
I've rarely met a girl who`s a potent argument in favor of international relations.
You will dog our footsteps in the batmobile.
You`lI keep watch via the Batscanner.
-If the Riddler tries to make good--
-I'll bash him brutally.
-Then we close in with the police. -Yes.
-Got your driver`s license?
-In my wallet.
Good man. Drive carefully.
Good luck!
This may be a memorable night.
This curtain which separates our countries is so foolish.
If we could just contrive some way of getting more deeply involved with each other.
Da, we must search for such a method.
It's wrong to listen to this.
Some things have to be private, even for a crime fighter.
Your discretion is admirable, Master Robin, yes.
-Time for another check-in.
-Roger.
-Commissioner.
-Yes?
-Yes, Boy Wonder.
-Batmobile position:
Gotham Park, proceeding south on West Drive.
About to pass Benedict Arnold monument.
still in the park?
lt`s been almost an hour.
What are they doing?
No comment, commissioner.
Let`s just say, no sign of criminal activity.
Yes, I understand.
I've just thought of a clever ruse.
Have Chief O'Hara flash the Batsignal.
If you say so, but why?
The crooks will think we're racing to headquarters.
Thinking we`re out of the way, they might strike at Miss Kitka!
DevilishIy clever!
-Thank you.
Batmobile over and out.
-Right.
-Chief O'Hara, flash the BatsignaI.
-Yes, sir.
Shades of Smolensk, what is that?
BRUCE: Incredible, I don't--
How clever.
-Clever, Comrade Wayne?
I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka.
It's the Batsignal, from the roof of police headquarters.
Batman must be racing there in response.
Then you did get the police to call them in for my protection.
Yes, yes.
How perfectly wonderful of you!
I close my eyes and I dream of those savage Cossacks racing over the steps on their mission.
How strange.
I close my eyes, and I dream of something quite astonishingly different.
Keep your eyes closed.
Continue with this dream.
The dream continues.
-It approaches a climax. -Nyet.
Not so fast.
Be more slow.
Miss Kitka?
May I see you home to that penthouse apartment?
-He swallowed the Catbait!
-And now to make him Batbait.
Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch, the jetpack umbrellas! Yo-ho-ho, sir!
I'Il slip into something more comfortable while your cocoa is warming.
Is that prudent?
Our instructions were to keep watch.
I don`t know about prudent.
But it`s the only decent thing to do.
Perhaps.
Yes, yes.
There it is, 73rd Street and Concord Avenue.
follow me down to the terrace.
And all my days are trances And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka.
"To One in Paradise,`' first stanza.
About that dream you had....
-Do we dare?
-Why not?
Yes, of course.
Why not?
Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action?
Into action, comrade.
Miss Kitka, I have the strangest feeling that I am about to be utterly and madly carried away.
-This is a kidnapping!
-Our joke's on you!
You filthy criminals!
-Much as one deplores indiscretion--
-Right.
I'Il just take one tiny, tiny peek.
-Holy demolition!
-bless my dustpan!
Cover the exits.
I'Il race up with my Batrope!
Holy Halloween!
Strange, Batman shouId`ve been here hours ago.
Maybe you didn't leave a clear enough clue.
I did!
I can`t understand why Batman hasn`t dashed into our trap.
He puts his foot here, my secret jack-in-the-box fires shooting him over the sea into the waiting arms of Penguin's exploding octopus.
What a deliciously humorous trajectory!
And nothing to link us with the crime.
You abominable outlaws!
What have you done with Miss Kitka?
She`s quite well, Mr. Wayne.
I swear by heaven, if you've harmed that girl l`ll kill you all.
I'Il rend you limb from limb!
Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive?
Where is she?
Show me Miss Kitka or l`lI wreck this place with my dying breath!
Blindfold the captive.
Lead him down the labyrinthine path to chamber 1 7.
Two minutes, no more.
-Turn on the secret microphone.
-Quiet, quiet!
-Miss Kitka.
-Comrade Wayne.
-Are you all right?
I'Il curse myself forever.
This nasty soup we`re in is of my brewing.
If I hadn't let your beauty lull me off guard....
Off guard, comrade?
There are some things I cannot disclose.
But we're in the hands of the most vicious foursome.
I fear we have nothing to look forward to but death.
It may not be that black, Comrade Wayne.
Batman and Robin are probably hot on our trail.
From something I happened to overhear i think we are merely bait for Batman.
Once he`s in their trap, we`ll be released.
A slender hope, Miss Kitka.
More slender than you can know.
You do not think Batman will get here?
That I cannot say.
Did you overhear any mention of any other prisoner of this rotten gang?
No, I did not.
Who on earth could you mean?
Commodore Schmidlapp ringing for his tea.
Just a thought, it doesn't matter.
Speedy escape is our only hope.
A moment, while I think....
Why didn't I think of it sooner? [BELL RINGS]
Of what?
Up my sleeve I have a radio transmitter strapped above my elbow.
-What a curious device to carry.
-Not at alI.
Capitalists who carry a lot of money have safety contrivances.
If I can just get at it....
wiggle around back-to-back.
Maybe you can reach it with your fingers.
Let's get him.
There we are.
You think you`re pretty clever, don't you?
-Clever enough to outwit you.
-We`ll see about that.
Dear colleagues, Iet`s see what`s strapped above his left elbow.
Cretinous creatures!
I knew you`d been listening in!
I told you that fish story about a radio....
Get him!
Miss Kitka!
Where are you?
-Great day!
-Hello, commissioner.
Dick, we`re late for that demonstration.
Excuse us.
But you can`t dash off now.
How did you escape?
-With the aid of Batman.
-Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader.
Return to police headquarters.
He may wish to call you.
My fine finkish friends, you have heard my astounding proposal.
What do you say?
What do you say? !
Our strike cannot be postponed.
We`re at the mercy of the Gotham River tide.
It's now or never to get through the channel.
Batman will never come here now.
But the police will, any instant.
So, to the Penguin's princely plan. Is it yes or no?
It's crazy, but let's try it.
We have to get Batman out of the way.
Oh, go ahead, Penguin.
Would you drop one of your dream pills into Commodore Schmidlapp's tea?
-Presto!
-Then carry him to the submarine!
Mr. RiddIer, will you tell Mr. Quetch to fetch the five guinea pigs?
-Fetch the guinea pigs. -Yo-ho.
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
Now, my fine fishy finks you see the commodore's pièce de "no-résistance" an instant whiskey maker.
Waiting for us to put it to more universal use.
Don't be afraid.
You`lI feel nothing.
I am merely going to temporarily extract every bit of moisture from your bodies!
It's a painless operation.
-Delightful!
-Dehydrated!
Catwoman, will you get a dustpan and put every one of them very carefully into separate vials?
Mr. RiddIer, would you prepare the submarine to get underway while I prepare a terrifying demolition charge for the police?
-Where do we meet?
-United world building.
Gotham River.
39th floor.
The elevator.
-One hour?
-One hour.
What criminal genius, Catwoman!
Who but a genius could conceive such an audacious plot?
To trick Batman and Robin into inviting me to their Batcave with five dehydrated death-dealing pirates at my command.
careful, careful.
Every one of them has a mother.
Out, Batarang and Batrope.
Stand clear.
With people in weird outfits like the supercrooks around here it's amazing no one reports this place to the police!
It's a low neighborhood, full of rum pots.
They attribute curious sights to alcoholic delusions.
Gosh, drink is sure a filthy thing.
I'd rather be dead than unable to trust my own eyes.
Yes, honey.
There was someone walking up the wall.
Ready with super-blinding BatpeIlets.
-Away, Robin.
Away!
-But--
Come on, Batman.
Miss Kitka!
Quick, everyone!
Flee for your lives!
into the street!
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.
-It`s all right.
-Holy heart failure!
I was able to dispose of that bomb just in time and shield myself behind these heavy iron pipes.
You risked your life to save that riffraff in the bar?
They may be drinkers, but they`re also human beings and may be salvaged.
I had to do it!
But we lost the trail of that angelic Miss Kitka.
Stranded without a clue!
Ahoy there!
Could you chaps direct me to a policeman?
Commodore Schmidlapp`s the name.
Big Ben DistilIeries, you know.
-Holy costume party.
The Penguin!
-Obviously.
What's his game?
-What's your game, Penguin?
-Penguin?
No, my name's Schmidlapp, old boy, Schmidlapp.
Your fingerprints will settle that hash.
We`lI check them against our mobile anti-crime file in our Batmobile.
Let's see your hands.
Looks like pIastic-coated fingertips!
Yes, I scorched myself pressing a waistcoat.
I do believe the attending surgeon did use plastic, yes.
It looks bad.
This brassy bird has us buffaIoed.
Not quite.
There's one method of identification no one can evade.
Retinal eye patterns?
He's right.
The pattern of blood vessels in the retina, as individual as a fingerprint.
Don't you have an anti-criminal, eye-pattern master file in your Batcave?
Why don`t you take me there?
-You`ll submit yourself to a test?
-It might be an amusing experience.
Stand by to catch him, Robin.
I'Il give him the Batgas.
What?
Batgas?
An anesthetic, necessary to prevent you from seeing the entrance to the Batcave.
If anyone knew that, they could pierce the secret of our identities.
Ready, commodore?
Oh, I say, what deucedIy strange customs you colonials have!
well, I'm ready.
To the Batmobile.
This could be our break.
-Why did he let us take him?
-We`ll soon know.
-I've got the eye checker.
-Stay on alert.
After I give him the Batwake, we must be ready for anything.
Oh, it's you.
We`re here, eh?
I see.
Oh, what's this? Oh, say!
This is extraordinary!
It's absolutely extraordinary!
I must say, your laboratory exceeds the limits of man`s wildest imagination.
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?
Your Batgas has left me with a parched sensation.
The water dispenser is clearly marked.
All right, thank you.
Help yourself, commodore.
Slake your thirst.
You`lI have worse than a parched sensation when we`re through.
Perhaps, perhaps.
But I am appalled by your attitude, sir.
Condemning me before the facts have been authoritatively established!
You are abrogating my constitutional rights, sir.
robin: All set.
Come on, Penguin.
Time to rip off your false feathers.
Coming, Batman.
I'm coming at once.
robin: Holy hallucination!
I wish it were, but it's five dehydrated pirates, rehydrated!
At them, me hearties!
Shiver them from stem to stern!
Attack them, you faltering fink!
They`re gone!
Popped like balloons.
How did it happen?
Whoever dehydrated those pirates couldn't have foreseen their rehydration with the heavy water we use to recharge the atomic pile!
It left them in an unstable condition!
You saw it yourself. The slightest impact was sufficient to instantly reduce them to antimatter.
Antimatter?
You mean, they won`t be coming back?
No, Robin.
Not in this universe.
Let that be a lesson in the dangers of tampering with the laws of Mother Nature.
My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.
-You have?
-You were duped. Brainwashed.
The criminals planted those dehydrated thugs on you.
You were obviously under the influence of post-hypnotic suggestion when you rehydrated them.
Come on down, commodore.
Another sniff of Batgas, and we'Il all return to the city.
Are you sure you didn`t hurt your head?
perfectly.
swallow this pill.
Now, give our friend here a whiff of Batwake.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
manifold pressure`s dropping.
We`d better stop and check it.
-Sorry about that.
Won`t take long.
-Yes, you will!
Yo-ho and away we go in my BirdmobiIe!
One side kick for a sailor.
-You okay?
-Thanks to the anti-Penguin gas pill!
He's played right into our hands.
Via BatcycIe to the Batcopter!
We`lI track him to the gang's new hideout.
Disengage go-cart.
Batscanner tracking the stolen Batmobile.
Port two degrees, then steady as she goes!
Yo-ho, port two degrees!
We`re almost there!
-Where are you going?
-To fire off more riddIing clues.
Riddler! You're mad!
Penguin's finished Batman by now.
That miserable, waddling mountebank of a bird!
He couldn't finish a bag of popcorn!
Say Penguin failed.
All the more reason not to hand them clues.
Outwitting Batman is my sole delight my joy, my heaven on earth, my very paradise.
Riddler, come back!
Stolen Batmobile turning, heading up Gotham River Drive.
Polaris-type missile coming right for us!
Hold on!
This may be tricky.
-Damage?
-The tail rotor's disengaged.
Brace yourself, Robin, we're going down.
This could be the end.
Now, to find my riddIing Polaris skywriter!
Look!
Look, the Dynamic Duo!
I got them.
I got them.
Holy horseshoe!
Some luck, landing right on top of a bed of foam rubber!
The odds against it would make even the most reckless gambler cringe.
True, I did think I'd spotted it out of the corner of my eye, but--
That crazy missile wrote two more riddles before it blew up.
An egg!
Make applesauce.
apples into applesauce.
A unification into one smooth mixture.
An egg, nature's perfect container.
The container of our future hopes.
A unification in a container of hope? United World Organization!
precisely!
And the Security council meets today.
-If what I fear is true--
-Let`s commandeer a taxi.
No, not at this time of day.
Luckily we're in tip-top condition.
It'Il be faster if we run.
Let`s go!
We are now passing through the grotto.
-Depth, half a fathom.
-Engines, dead slow astern.
Dead slow astern.
As the blueprint said, an abandoned construction elevator.
Hecate, sniff out the weak spot.
-I hope Penguin made it.
-Who needs him?
Stand back.
Hey!
Can't you read?
A fine day for penguins.
My co-conspirators, we meet as planned.
No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo has been silenced forever.
Blasted out of the sky by a coincidence!
The delicious irony of it!
Downed by Riddler`s Polaris skywriter.
Happy happenstance!
Hold your breaths as we cross the hall.
There are still lingering traces of my finely filtered Penguin gas.
Holy marathon!
I'm getting a stitch!
Let's hope it`s a stitch in time that saves nine. The nine members of the Security Council.
It is the opinion of Her Majesty that we pursue peace at alI costs.
Our poor united world in microcosm.
I'm afraid they`lI find our humor very, very dry.
We understand your position, but for peace--
It has always been our policy--
quickly now!
Each one in a separate vial.
And, boys, don`t anybody sneeze.
BATMAN:
seal the building! robin:
Close the ventilating system!
The Security Council may have been dehydrated!
Emergency, operator.
Get me security.
Emergency, operator, emergency!
Up, up, up, up!
-Surrender! You criminals!
-The United underworld is through!
What's this, an apparition?
One false move, and you'lI find out. We`lI hurl our Batarangs!
-To the elevator!
-Catwoman!
Stop, I said!
I don`t think you mean that.
Miss Kitka dies if you take one more step!
Go!
This way, Robin!
The Security Council, gone!
What a fiendishly clever way to abduct nine men from a heavily guarded building!
Where does that elevator go?
Downstairs, to an abandoned submarine dock on the river.
Holy Captain Nemo!
They'Il head for sea by way of Short Island Sound.
We have just one trump card left.
Heaven help the world if we fail.
Come on!
Down periscope.
We`re over the last bar.
Mr. BIuebeard, all engines full ahead.
Yo-ho, all engines full ahead!
What a delightful haul!
Mr. RiddIer, will you prepare those nine radio ransom messages?
And no stupid riddles.
Make those messages plain.
One billion dollars cash, from each country.
precisely!
To be delivered to our secret island by the horde of trained carrier pigeons which I shall provide.
No whimsical embellishments.
Make those messages clear!
Make those messages clear!
It's like a dream, Pengy-sweet.
Nothing can stop us now.
Sonar contact.
Range 8000.
Bearing 1 81 .
Yo-ho, sonar contact.
small craft at 7500, bearing 01 .
small craft?
It's moving fast.
Range is down to 7000.
-The Batboat!
-Drat that cockIeshelI!
Mr. BIuebeard, steady on the diving planes.
I'Il man the torpedo tubes.
Would you fire a surface-to-surface underwater homing missile?
missile ahoy!
It has a homing device in its nose cone.
Take evasive action.
No use.
It`s tracking us!
Take my Batradio.
I looked it up this morning.
That class of missile receives on a wavelength of 1 64.1 .
-1 64.1 .
-quickly! Send a jamming signal.
It's starting down.
farewell, Batman!
farewell, Dynamic Duo!
Holy bikini, that was close!
Yo-ho, small craft still closing.
Range 4000.
Bearing 88.
They know how to jam our missiles.
Up to periscope depth!
MAN: Yo-ho, up to periscope depth.
-Range 3500.
-Get the Batcharge launcher.
Roger!
They hold nine of the world`s most eminent men in dehydrated condition.
Our task is not to sink that sub, merely to drive it to the surface.
Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Yo-ho!
Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Five, four, three, two torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes away!
-Dive, Mr. Bluebeard, dive!
-Yo-ho, dive.
Down periscope.
Torpedo off the port bow!
Prepare to fire Batcharges in front of torpedoes.
That`s too soon!
It must be Batcharges!
And that means there'lI be more of the dread things meant for us!
You dismal bird!
You and your submarine!
Shut up, you feline floozy!
Mr. BIuebeard, down 30 fathoms.
Run silent, run deep.
They`re diving, silent engines.
I'Il circle them at full-thrust speed, diminishing radius of curvature.
Roger.
What's their bearing?
-I don't know, sir.
-You don`t know?
It's changing every second.
They must be circling us.
Fire when ready.
I'Il maintain curvature.
Yo-ho!
Compartments A, B and C taking in water, sir!
Penguin, you know I can't take water!
You cowardly kitten, you want to live forever?
-This bird has flown around the bend!
-To cuckooland!
Oh, RiddIer, joker, do something!
We weren't meant for a watery grave!
Now hear this!
Now hear this!
Blow all tanks! Surface!
Surface!
Cut the Batcharges.
They`ve had enough, I imagine.
They`re surfacing fast.
-Estimated surfacing position?
-200 yards.
Here they come.
Diminishing speed.
Ready to board.
Roger.
Pirates!
To arms!
Prepare to repel boarders!
Strike your colors!
We have not yet begun to fight!
Attack!
Bon voyage, pussy.
Holy heartbreak!
Miss Kitka!
Batman, I....
Say no more, Robin.
It could be compromising.
Of course.
It's just one of those things in the life of every crime fighter.
It means nothing.
Snap on the Batcuffs.
Batman to coast guard.
There's a submarine two miles east of Sandy Nose.
It's filled with human jetsam.
Come, take it in tow.
Robin.
Over here, look.
The hope of the world, tottering on the brink!
Holy almost!
To think, it might have been shattered before our very eyes.
-Up, Catwoman.
-The service here has gone to pot.
What the devil is this?
The captain`s costume party?
Holy jumble!
Where's the hope of the world now?
Batcentrifuge at 32,000 rpm.
Increase angstrom force in vector X.
Vector X up one notch.
-Yes, commissioner? -What progress?
is there hope?
There's always hope.
But do you think you and Robin can separate that mingled dust back into its constituent members?
With all modesty, commissioner if we can`t, heaven knows who can.
Truer words were never spoken.
PRESIDENT: Howdy, you all.
How are those boys doing up there?
Batman says there`s hope, Mr. President.
What more can one ask?
The free world is waiting.
tell Batman I salute him and wish him luck.
I needn't tell you with whom I have just spoken.
Ready for separation.
All right.
I'Il activate the computer link.
Input the ethnic and national factors.
-Batman, wait a minute! -What?
well, with the way the world is and all maybe we ought to try to improve those factors?
-ReshuffIe them a little. -No.
It's not for us to tamper with the laws of nature.
In this very Batcave, you saw a ghastly example of what happens when one tries to do that.
Gosh, yes.
When you put it that way....
Here we go.
Separation accomplished.
Ready to rehydrate.
Separation accomplished.
They are ready to rehydrate.
We are ready to rehydrate.
[MEN speaking OVER LOUDSPEAKERS IN foreign LANGUAGES]
They are ready to rehydrate.
A solemn moment, gentlemen.
One of dedication and humble supplication.
Robin, prepare to rehydrate.
Ready to rehydrate.
Turn on the water faucet.
Success!
Success!
They`ve done it!
They`ve done it!
Success, success!
We`ve done it, we`ve done it!
[MEN speaking OVER LOUDSPEAKERS IN foreign LANGUAGES]
MAN: Success!
Success!
What the--?
In the interest of peace, you must hear me out!
Gentlemen, it is imperative that we limit our conversation to peace.
Who knows, Robin?
This strange mixing of minds may be the greatest single service ever performed for humanity.
Let's go, but inconspicuously.
Through the window.
We`lI use our Batropes.
Our job is finished.

[ENGLISH SDH]
Come on, move.
Let go of me...
Help... help...
Someone please help...
Leave her alone and I'll spare you.
Dare to fight with me?
I can see that you don't want to hurt her. Otherwise I'd have taken your life instead.
Don't be rash.
You are right.
I'm the head of Mati village.
This one's my son, he's from our village too.
Why did you kidnap her?
She's the daughter of our county magistrate.
You kidnap the county magistrate's daughter... Don't you fear the imperial law?
We're prepared to lay down our lives.
You don't know, young man... There's been drought at our place for many years.
The imperial court has exempted our provision. But the county magistrate kept pressing on us.
We have nowhere to turn to.
Therefore we kidnapped his daughter... Hoping that he'll loosen his grip on us.
If not, we'll die with his daughter.
I hope you'll understand us.
This is outrageous, completely insane.
Liang tong, did you find out who kidnapped the lady?
Yes, the kidnapper is... the chief of Mati village, Gao Baoshi. And his son Gao Jixian. There is also this guy named Li Juren.
They have tied up the lady at the mill.
You lead a team and bring her back.
Yes. Master Xin, you take along some more men.
Spare no mercy for those rascals, but...
Make sure that lady is safe.
Yes. Master Yan, we can win for sure if you will go.
Just a few bumpkins, Master Qian and his gang would suffice.
Go on.
Master Yan.
Ling long.
You... you're not going?
I'm here to protect, not to kill.
Lady is very kind even to servants like us.
But I'm also from the Mati village.
Jixian is my friend since childhood.
I heard that they are there too at the mill.
You think they are safe?
It's fate.
But, taking this step, you think we can deal with that hypocrite!
That bastard thinks this place is so remote that... even the Emperor can do nothing.
He has no respect for law, nothing but corruption.
If so, why do you still challenge him?
We're forced to do that.
Other villages can't give them any more provision. They were taken away and died two days later.
There's just this much rice for our whole family.
What else can I give him?
This is insane, we have completely nothing.
Master Gao, shall we finish this rice first?
My brother will bring us more later.
Okay, Jixian.
I heard that they lost the war at the border. General Lu died in the war. Minister Yuan took the imperial sword... to the border.
He's sure to pass through here.
So we've petitioned all their guilt.
Minister Yuan is a good official. I'm sure he'll do us justice.
I only fear we might not be able to see him.
Maybe I can help.
I'm confused, I don't even know your name... or where you are from.
I'm Lu Fang, I broke the encirclement and came here.
General Lu is your...
My departed grandfather. So you're Mr. Lu.
I didn't know, please excuse our rudeness.
Jixian.
Kowtow to Mr. Lu.
Mr. Lu.
Our country is undergoing such a crisis,
I doubt if anyone would care for formalities. I'm also trying to see minister Yuan in Peking.
I'll leave tomorrow.
If I meet him en route... I'll inform him of your situation.
Oh...thank you.
Mr. Lu must be very tired.
Maybe you should have some rest.
But this place is such a mess.
I think this place is very nice.
When we were at the war front, we didn't have nothing as good as this.
Master Xin, of course you can handle this. But the lady is still in their hand.
Liang tong, you deal with them from the front.
And I'll bring my men to attack from the back.
Master Gao, the government troops are here.
Listen, release the lady... and all of you won't be executed.
What about our provisions?
Release her first.
No. The county magistrate has to come and... tell us himself that he will cut our provisions.
If you still act so stubborn, we'll break in.
We're ordered to spare no mercy for you guys.
One step further and I'll kill her.
You stupid old fart.
Dare to kidnap our lady, I'll kill you...
Who are you? This is none of your business.
It's everybody's business.
The bodyguard of the county magistrate.
Can a county magistrate indulge his bodyguard? Solid proof of corruption.
I see you don't want to live, let me...
Liang tong.
Anyone else?
Let's go.
Thanks for your help.
If not, we all would've been dead now.
Thanks.
This young man is pretty good.
Last year, when things weren't that bad, everyone in the village learnt a bit of martial arts.
But we lose when it comes to facing these bandits.
After you leave tomorrow, I don't think we can...
I've killed a few of them; things are complicated.
I'll wait here for minister Yuan.
Thanks, thanks so much.
Later when we have time, I'll teach you a bit.
Thanks... thanks.
You should bow and say: thanks, master.
Yes, master.
A bunch of good-for-nothing.
Where's master Yan?
He went out.
Where to?
I guess in Choi's restaurant, enjoying himself.
- Ask him to come back.
- Yes. Liang tong, ask master Yan to come back.
You all take a rest too.
My lord, I think that man is pretty skillful.
He might far exceed master Yan.
I have a friend named Hanrui.
He's nicknamed eight-handed master, very skillful.
He has a few skillful men with him.
If we're willing to pay them a handsome amount, then...
Good, where are they?
Eagle castle, eight miles out of town.
Okay. Take 300 dollars from the treasury and go now.
If only they can take care of this matter, I'll pay them generously.
My lord, you don't have to worry that much.
They won't dare to harm the lady.
They simply can't dare! But minister Yuan was assigned to the border.
He'll pass by here in 2 to 3 days.
We have to settle this matter as soon as possible. Otherwise, if he hears of this... we'll be in trouble.
How come Yan Ziqing isn't back yet!
All he knows is killing and bridging the law.
I see that his kung fu is pretty good. So I released him from the jail. And even hired him as my bodyguard.
And see now how he repays me.
My lord, we still have a few bandits in the jail.
Maybe they can...
Forget it. One Yan Ziqing is enough.
If we have a few more...
My lord, there is some difference between them.
Yan Ziqing likes to play hero. He kills for the sake of justice.
But this is a real bandit group; they want money.
As long as you pay them generously... they will do whatever you want.
But of course they are not completely reliable. And so does that Yan Ziqing.
So we should let them monitor each other.
I'm such a man, with all my skills.
Don't drink too much.
What are you afraid of, the night has just begun.
All I'm saying is, I don't want you to be drunk and get grumpy.
Hey, Miss, where's your boss?
She's inside, please take a seat.
No, I'm here for master Yan.
Yes. Tell him that some urgent matter awaits him. We want him back to the office immediately.
Okay.
Who's this lass, I have never seen her before.
She's the daughter of Gao Baoshi.
Her family is poor, she just started work here.
Gao Baoshi.
Who is it?
Someone from the office has requested you back.
What's the matter? The county magistrate has some urgent matters.
It's a duty from the county magistrate, try your best.
Come.
The county magistrate considers you important. So he wants to hire you, what do you think?
Are you sure?
Even if I lie, never will these silver dollars.
Once you agree, all of you will be released.
And he has a handsome reward for you all.
Good.
My lord.
I've already spoken to them.
Hmm... good.
Each of you will get ten silvers... after you kill that guy at the mill.
Another ten silvers await you upon return. And for one who can rescue my daughter... there's a reward of another fifty silver dollar.
He's the only exception. All of us are willing to work for you, my lord.
Good.
Master Yan, you go with them.
If anyone tries to desert or conspire against me, Kill him at once.
Let's get to work.
My lord, we've been wronged.
Shut up...
Who is this?
He's a stranger from nowhere.
He hurt two men, made a big fuss outside the office.
And when we arrested him... he didn't resist! He said he can have two meals in the jail. Now he's here awaiting your order.
Bring him in.
Yes... hey, you, come out.
Quickly, our lord wants to speak to you.
Quickly.
Take him out.
Get up...
My friend, what's your name?
I'm Huang Liang.
I'm Yan Ziqing.
My lord, this man comes into jail for the sake of getting some food.
My friend, I see that you're really skillful.
If you will work for me, not only will you get food. I'll also reward you handsomely.
Food is all I need.
Master Yan, take him along as well.
Wang, you have a big family. You'll need this food.
Save it for yourself.
No... please bring this to master Gao.
It doesn't matter if we don't have enough.
But they need food badly.
I'm going.
I hear the office sent out many warriors and police.
When you get to the mill, be very careful.
I understand.
Why do you need this? Don't fight with others!
Don't worry, it's just a precaution.
Mr. Lu, have some corn porridge.
Jixian, you take it.
No, master, you, you take it.
Mr. Lu, you broke the encirclement... into places so remote, you must be hungry.
I insist you have it.
A student ought to obey the master.
When a master orders him to eat, he has to eat.
Take it.
You eat.
You eat.
No, Dad, you eat first.
I can't take it anymore, you eat.
See, you should understand by now.
Why do you think they kidnapped you!
Have you ever seen someone so hungry before?
Something that you take for granted is precious to them!
And your father still forces them for provisions.
It's true that they kidnapped you... but you can't blame them.
When we were fighting at the border... ten thousand of us were weak and tired. Surrounded by two hundred thousand Qing soldiers. We didn't even have strength to pick up our weapons.
Most of us died in the remote mountains.
But you people here are still enjoying life. Sucking blood from the poor.
I know you're not a part of this.
A lady like you would know nothing about sufferings.
This hairpin is yours, I suppose.
It's worth a year's income for this whole family.
The village people!
Hey, kid, dare to come out and fight with me!
Brother, he isn't worth fighting with.
Let me go.
Okay.
Hey, kid, come on.
Allow me to send you to hell right now.
You're Mr. Lu?
Huang Liang?
Our young master is here.
Whoever wishes to fight may fight with me.
Just now I've seen how good Huang is.
This gentleman seems to be very skillful.
I'd like to have a round with you, no matter who wins.
At least I'll have something to report upon return.
Good, please.
Please.
Really good, I'll report my mission.
Master, you're really skillful.
This Yan Ziqing works for the county magistrate. He's something to be feared. Now he lost the fight to you.
This man's really something. He's different from the others.
I've tried my best but still can't win over him.
This one is brother Huang.
He's also from the battle at the border.
I didn't have enough to eat in the jail.
I got this one on the road.
We can share it.
Brother Huang, you just came out from the jail?
Yes, after I came out from the battlefront, I was so tired and hungry.
Now all of us... believe that general Lu is a hero.
But the battlefield... drains my spirit.
When I came to this county, I had absolutely nothing on me.
Kept thinking how could a man like me... go to steal or rob?
So I made a big fuss outside the government office. And thus found myself food and lodging.
The county magistrate is short of fighters. So he has his eyes on the prisoners.
Never could I have dreamed to meet you here.
Master Huang, where did you get this?
On the road outside the village.
What about the man who carried this bag?
That guy was killed!
Brother...
The man who had this bag... is my brother.
He was trying to deliver food to us.
See, this is the mark on the bag, sewed on it by my sister-in-law.
Li, don't be upset.
We have only our fate to blame.
This man is really something, even I can't win him.
If my lord wants to take him, we need someone else.
My lord, be patient.
We didn't have complete control over him yet.
If we force him too much, it'll ruin our plan.
This guy is getting worse and worse.
My lord, Yan Ziqing and the kid didn't have a real fight. It's more like a game.
We have some friends. They hide away because a few of us were caught.
If the lord promises not to bring out the past... I'll ask our big brother to take them all out.
You can count on me. We'll go back and rescue the lady.
Okay, you go and find them.
As long as you settle this matter for me, I'll pardon all your guilt and even reward you.
My lord.
What?
I've got some news. The villagers of Mati... have got a petition against you.
They plan to hand it in to minister Yuan... when he passes through here.
How dare these bumpkins!
My lord, we are the officials anyway... to deal with these morons.
We can use the bandits.
My lord, this one is our big brother Sheng.
Very good.
I'll give each of your men ten silver dollars.
You can do whatever you want at the Mati village.
When you get the petition, another hundred.
But don't say that I sent you.
Since it's now daybreak, it'd be quiet there.
Go right now.
To deal with those bumpkins... these bandits are good enough.
But to deal with that kid at the mill...! They can do nothing.
My daughter's in their captivity for one whole night.
Just now Liang tong has a suggestion.
When he went to look for master Yan in the Choi's, he saw a young woman. Heard that she is the daughter of Gao Baoshi.
They have kidnapped lady, we'll kidnap his daughter.
A bumpkin's daughter is no comparison to mine.
Of course she's no lady.
But the parents will worry all the same.
We'll take Gao's daughter to the mill... and force them to release our lady.
Good, act immediately.
Who's here at this early hour?
Open the door...
Did you hear me... open the door...
Go, open the door, what are you afraid of?
I'll see who has the guts to come here.
Open.
My lord.
My lord, it's her.
Take her.
Take her away. What's the matter?
It's good you're here, come with me.
Go...
Big brother, this guy killed my brother.
Be careful, he's really skillful.
Go on...
Surround him.
Come on.
Mister, don't go, you're hurt.
It's not serious, doesn't matter.
Mister, thanks for saving my life.
It's...it's nothing.
A step.
Thanks, master.
Thanks for your teachings, please take a seat.
Papa Dad...
Sister.
If anyone comes a step closer I'll kill her.
Sister.
This is an order from our lord. You release our lady, and we'll release her.
You release my daughter first.
You wish!
You release our lady first before we release her. Dad...
leave me alone. Don't release this hypocrite's daughter.
How dare you, give her a good strike.
- Jing yu.
- Sister.
Are you going to release our lady?
I...
Dad, this hypocrite's daughter is in your hand.
He has other plan, if you release her. Think he will pardon us?
Beat.
Stop it, I'll...
If you don't comply, you'll all die.
One more word and I'll kill you.
Dad, don't release her.
Jing yu.
You killed my daughter. And I'll kill yours.
Wei Huaire. I'll cut her up bit by bit.
Mr. Lu.
Wei, listen.
You've rescued my daughter, I'm so grateful.
Hold it...
Please.
If I release your daughter... You have to promise not to investigate them. And to follow what the imperial court ordered.
- About this...
Your daughter is in my hold.
Make up your mind quickly.
I can agree to other conditions. But these three men kidnapped my daughter. And threatened me.
If I pardon them... How can I be a county magistrate hereafter?
You want to kill them?
I'll do this as a favor to you. I won't kill them, but I'll have to punish them.
How?
At least 100 slashes.
Okay, I'll take the 100 slashes for them.
Mr. Lu...
How's that?
Okay, that's a deal.
Don't go back on your words.
You think I won't keep my promise...
In front of so many people.
Mr. Lu.
Young man, make sure you won't regret later.
A word is a word.
Jixian.
Give this sword to Huang Liang.
Ask him to wait for me at the mill.
Lady, please...
Dad.
Let's go.
Hope Mr. Lu will not fall into his trap.
I'll wait for his news here.
You should go back to see if everything's okay.
We were away from home for two whole days.
40.
41.
42.
Dad...
Wenzhen.
Dad, stop it, stop it.
How many?
89 already.
Make it 100.
90.
My lord, 100 slashes are completed.
Lock him up.
Dad.
None of your business.
Go on.
Dad, Mr. Lu is my savior.
How can you treat him like that?
He sided with those crooks and challenged me.
Dad, you didn't know... He is the son of general Lu jingsheng.
So what?
General Lu has sacrificed for the country. You can't...
Since we know who he is... We can't release him.
Minister Yuan is coming. He is a friend of Lu family.
If I release him, he'll report me.
Then, Dad, what do you intend?
I'll let him starve to death here.
Wei Huaire didn't keep his word, that bastard.
Where's the petition?
They said it's with the village head...
Gao Baoshi in the mill.
Come, follow me.
Someone's here.
It's him.
Stand there.
Give us the petition.
Dad, let's go.
Get the petition.
The petition's not with them.
We'll return to the office.
You'll wait for me here.
I'll deal with them.
How is it going?
We've killed Gao and his gang.
Where's the petition?
I have it, but... 100 silvers is too less.
How much you want?
3000.
3000 is a big sum.
We'll need to arrange.
It won't do any of us good if you wait here.
We'll meet you somewhere and pay you there. How's that?
Good, we'll wait in the bush up the hill.
I'll give you the petition upon payment.
Good... please...
Let's go...
Adviser, you mean...
Master Qian has already got the men.
I was thinking...
Ling long sewed this for him.
They were really close since childhood.
Owing to their poverty...
Ling long was sold to the office as a maid.
I buried his brother yesterday, bury him today.
It's my fault.
No, you help us to drive those bandits away.
If it's not you, I'll...
You didn't know that they will come back.
You didn't know, I was...
Take this money.
Master Huang, where are you going?
To the office to rescue Mr. Lu.
Don't go.
That bastard went back on his word.
The Gao family is killed. Think he will spare Mr. Lu?
Don't go, it's too dangerous.
I have to tell you something.
I didn't mean to kill him.
Big brother, if Wei brings us the money, what about that petition?
Silly, once we get the money, we'll leave.
Were you sent by Wei?
And the money?
Wei sent you one word: kill.
What happened?
Huang Liang broke into the office.
Maybe he's here to save that Mr. Lu.
Lady, Huang is here to rescue Mr. Lu.
Good, but maybe he doesn't know the way to jail.
I'll show him.
Lady, what are you doing?
If you can save Mr. Lu... I'll consider you as my savior.
Lady, don't say that.
Don't move, who are you?
I'm the maid from the wine cellar, Ling long.
You... you are?
Ling long, I have something for you.
Jixian? He...
Was killed by the county magistrate.
If you want to avenge him, take me to the jail.
You're master Huang?
I'm here to rescue Mr. Lu.
Follow me.
Look around, quickly.
They are coming, I'll stop them.
You go to rescue Mr. Lu.
Ling long, why are you here?
Can't I come to see you?
Oh, yes, please, come inside.
Ling long.
Our lady sent me here to rescue you.
How come master Han is not here yet?
Adviser, send more men to take Huang Liang.
Get him dead or alive. Yes.
Master Xin.
Yes.
Go and check out at the jail. Make sure that Lu is still there. Right.
Master Yan, you should give us a hand.
Master Yan. You...
Go.
Wenzhen, did you see that Lu?
No.
Did you hear anything?
Why did you rescue me?
Then why did you rescue me the other day?
Go now, quick.
Scatter off, let me.
Mr. Lu is rescued. Try to delay them.
Over that side.
Quick.
Check both ways.
Mr. Lu, are you okay?
Yes.
You have to be careful.
Um...
I don't know if we can meet hereafter. I...
I'll be back.
I'll thank you when I return.
Go.
Master, lady is on our side.
Go quickly.
Lady, hurry back to your room.
Where is he?
I lost him here.
Let's all search around.
Search.
What are you doing here?
I boiled some water, waiting for you.
You're hurt.
I'm okay.
Attend to Mr. Lu first.
How was it?
First give it to Mr. Lu.
You don't hate me.
I know you didn't do it on purpose.
He thought I'm one of Wei's men.
So he took the first strike.
And I reacted too fast.
I understand.
We killed all of Sheng's gang. But still the petition was nowhere to be found.
Thanks to all of you.
It was nothing...
Here not only did we lose Huang Liang, Lu also escaped!
It's about dawn. Minister Yuan will pass by today. What should we do?
The problem is with Yan Ziqing.
You're right.
My lord, he let go of Huang Liang.
Even if Lu is released by Ling long... she can't kill master Qian.
Look what he has done.
This guy is not reliable, we can't leave him here.
Where's he now?
Where else, same old place.
I ask you all to execute this traitor. Together with Lu and Huang Liang.
They must have the petition.
You two go to look for Yan Ziqing.
Brother Hu, brother Zhu. We'll go to look for Lu and Huang Liang.
How come you're up so early?
I'm leaving. Why?
I killed master Qian last night. And I let go of Mr. Lu and Huang Liang.
As yet they don't know.
If I stay here, I'm afraid...
Then I'll go with you.
I don't know where I'll wander to.
Can you bear all these sufferings?
I don't mind, I have to be with you.
Ziqing...
Are you seeing someone else?
I can't even take care of myself.
Who else would I be seeing?
Unless I die, I won't let you leave me behind.
You're the boss here. To come along, how can you give up all this?
I can.
Ziqing, I'll pack and go with you now.
My Xiao Qing...
Ziqing, I'm dying...
I will never leave you again.
I'm your love...
Mr. Lu, how do you feel?
Much better.
Thanks to you and madam for taking care of me.
See.
I got this from the stream outside.
It's fate.
If only minister Yuan could come here... And take care of this corrupted bastard.
Gao and his family can rest in peace.
Have some porridge.
I'll dry this.
I'll take her back, you better rest.
I won't be long.
Okay.
Who is it?
It's me, Yan Ziqing. Good lord.
Thanks for rescuing me last night. I'm so grateful.
It's bad, Wei Huaire sent his men to attack me. Before daybreak.
My woman was also killed.
I need your help. It's all my fault.
I'll do whatever is in my power.
I'll kill him for revenge.
How are you feeling now? I've recovered.
I'll leave a word with Huang Liang, and we can go immediately.
Thanks. Not at all.
Brother Huang. I'm accompanying Yan to take revenge. Lu fang.
Let's go.
Yan Ziqing went to the office with Lu.
We'll first look for Huang Liang.
You are all out, and no one is in the office.
We'll return there. Right...
I can't see you back.
I'll follow them, to help Lu and Yan.
No, this is too risky.
These men look very skillful.
I'll give them a hand.
But...
I can't leave my friend behind.
Wenzhen, tell the truth.
Did you ask Ling long... to release that Lu?
Wei Huaire, you're so full of guilt.
I'll avenge for the villagers of Mati. Come to your death now.
Mr. Lu, do it as a favor for me. Pardon my dad.
Mr. Lu, master Yan. Please forgive me.
I regret deeply for my actions. I'll release those in jail. And exempt their provisions.
It's too late.
Mr. Lu, if you have to kill my dad, then kill me first.
This man is untrustworthy.
If you pardon him now, you'll regret later.
No... master Yan.
This time I won't eat my word.
If you don't trust me, stay here and watch. Once minister Yuan is here, I'll ask for his punishment.
Mr. Lu, now that I know who you are.
We're both government officials. Even if I'm full of guilt, it's up to minister Yuan to punish me. You can't kill me on your own terms.
Besides, since you two are here, where else can I go? Shut up.
Dad.
Master Yan. I'm wrong, but I did you a big favor in the past. Please forgive me this time.
Brother Yan, since we are here anyway, when minister Yuan comes, he can't escape punishment.
We don't have to take action ourselves.
Thanks to Mr. Lu, master Yan.
Tell adviser to prepare banquet in the second room. To treat these two heroes. And to welcome minister Yuan.
Please come to the second room.
You prepare the banquet. I'll go double-check. Yes.
Quickly.
Please take a seat.
When minister Yuan is here... you'll know my sincerity.
Our lord is captured by these two men.
Try to rescue him. C'mon, go...
Lock these prisoners up inside, quick. Get a wooden cage and move them. Minister Yuan is coming.
Okay, quick...
Don't go, don't go.
They have gone inside.
It's very urgent now.
You were hurt last time. If you go again this time, I... I'm afraid.
Loyalty is very important to a man. I can't leave them behind even if I have to die.
You...
Forget me, and go home.
I gain my life again because of your generosity.
I'll right my wrongs, heaven will know.
This is their petition for minister Yuan.
If you really regret for what you did... then hand this in personally to minister Yuan.
I'll do as you said.
My lord, we've prepared to welcome minister Yuan.
Good, take this petition and put it away safely.
This is for minister Yuan. Yes.
How can our hero be served this wine? ! Tell them.
Get the best wine out. Yes...
Please take a seat, Mr. Lu.
Tell lord later that the petition is here. Yes.
Red top is for the guest. Blue top is for our lord. Don't mix them up.
Yes.
Lady.
These two bottles are different.
You have to be very careful to make sure.
This will help you to differentiate.
Pour wine for the guests.
Minister Yuan is arriving. Prepare to welcome him.
Let's toast before we welcome minister Yuan.
I'll drink first for respect.
My friend, let's toast.
Get these two men. A big reward even if you get them dead!
Yes.
Mr. Lu, be careful.
Go, quickly.
Minister Yuan is outside the office.
Go inside quickly, get that kid.
Mr. Lu, brother Yan, I'm here. Huang Liang.
Huang Liang.
Stop.
County magistrate Wei Huaire bows to our minister. The minister's on an urgent military order.
We'll not stop for any meeting with local officials.
All can return to their own office, move.
Our petition.
You're from the Mati village?
Yes, lady. Take it.
Brother Yan.
Stop.
Mr. Lu, you be very careful. No, Yan.
Minister Yuan has left.
Take these two men and quickly execute them. Yes.
Stop it, Dad...
What are you doing here?
Mr. Lu and master Yan granted you pardon.
Is this how you repay their kindness!
Get off, go.
Stop.
Order from the minister, take Wei Huaire.
Everyone listen up. Don't make any further move.
My boy.
I just learnt that you've broken out of encirclement and came here. You are hurt...
It's not serious, it doesn't matter.
This here is hero Yan. Minister Yuan.
Had it not been for him, I'd have died at the hands of Wei Huaire.
I regret, however, that my companion in the battle,
Huang Liang, was killed.
I stopped you, but you had to come.
You... you had to come, huh.
Wei Huaire, what have you to say?
Wenzhen, so it's you who reported me.
It's me who reported you.
What about that petition?
It's thanks to you that she has it.
Dad, I had begged you to let go of Lu and Yan.
They've pardoned you, now you can't blame anyone.
Good!
So for this Lu... you betray even your own father!
I act out of justice. Not because of anyone.
You've violated the imperial law.
And I have to choose between you and justice.
After this, I'll turn to Buddhism and be a nun.
Wei Huaire ignored the court orders, collected provisions on his own and killed wrongfully.
He needs to be executed.
All who were a part of this act have to be arrested and punished accordingly.
Yes.
Take out the imperial sword and execute Wei Huaire here. Yes.
Otto.
Mr. Habershaw.
-Stop him! -Mr.
Habershaw.
Stop him.
Mr. Habershaw.

What's happening. Sam? What's happening?
-They're playing.
-But who's ahead?

I didn't say nothing about Buford or Tropp or Wilcox or nobody.
Well. say something.
How much money you figure is on the table right now?
None of my business.
Oh. come on. Sam.
It ain't no secret who's winning. is it?

This is one fancy rig old Ben Tropp rides around in.
Yes. it is.
Don't he give a damn what people think. him riding around the country in a hearse?
If you're the richest undertaker in Texas. you're entitled to a fancy rig.
But if you spend your days and nights trying to keep people alive you ride around in the likes of this.
Giddyup.

-You asking if we got rooms?
-One room for the three of us.
This is a cattleman's hotel. mister.
Not a family type.
The rooms we got ain't fitting for women and children.
Please. any kind of inside accommodation would look good to us right now.
-We've been on the road for days.
-We're very tired.
Well. top of the stairs. number 7.
That's the only room with two beds in it.
Boy can sleep in the wood box.

-Must be a big game.
The biggest. mister. The biggest.

-Yes. sir. in this town.
You just try to find a bigger game between here and the Mississippi.
-How big is that?
-Mister the five richest men in the territory are in that backroom playing for blood.
-How often does this go on?
-Once a year.
Twelve months they've been saving up their blood.
Meredith. let's go upstairs.
We're all very tired.
-ln a minute. Mary. -Come now.
Meredith.
-l was only gonna ask-- -l know what you were going to ask.
-What's wrong with asking?
-You know what's wrong.
So let's not talk about it.
We have things to do.
-What's the big rush?
-We've got to take that wagon to the smith.
We've got time for that.
We've got to get washed up. then we've got to see about food.
-We've got time. we're here overnight.
-Meredith. I refuse....
-Now. Mary.
-Now. Meredith.
Who's winning. Mr. Habershaw?
Mr. Habershaw?
-What's your pleasure. Mr. Habershaw?
-Who's winning. Mr. Habershaw?
Little more of that dog hair. Sam.
You quitting the game. Mr. Habershaw?
-Just stretching my legs.
-We hear Drummond's way ahead in there.
He's ahead.
He ain't way ahead.
Game's got a way to go yet. huh?
That's right.
Excuse me. you said the blacksmith was down the street.
You didn't say which way.
Due west to the end of the street and turn right.
Thank you. thank you very much.
Your health. sir.
And to the queen. and to the jack.
Thank you. sir.
Am I correct. sir. in assuming you're one of the players in the game?
-The assumption is correct. sir.
-ls it a private game. sir?
I mean to say. sir. would you permit a passing stranger to watch for a little while?
-Meredith.
-l said watch.
Nobody who ain't in the game gets in that room. huh. Mr. Habershaw?
Meredith--
Jackie?
Jackie. come here.
Jackie. what have you got--?
Meredith. we've got to get that wagon to the blacksmith.
We've got to leave town tomorrow.
There's a lot of work to be done on that wheel.
All I asked the gentleman was to be allowed to- - Mary. please.
-Mary. lookit. all I want to do is watch. -Meredith. you promised.
Good Lord. you don't want to deprive me of that too.
-l can't get into trouble watching.
-l never said you were going to--
Please listen. You and Jackie drive the wagon down to the smith's.
Let me watch the game till you get back from the blacksmith's.
-Meredith. you know very well you won't--
-This is fate. Mary. Don't you see that?
Chance to get into a game of cards in the middle of nowhere.
The good Lord give me this one last chance just to watch a game of cards.
There won't be any cards on the farm. you know that.
I've given my word.
Give me this one last little concession.
I won't be breaking my word if I just watch.
You just heard the gentleman say they don't allow any spectators.
is that a hard and fast rule. sir?
If I say you can watch. you can watch.
-But if the lady objects. I wouldn't think--
-There.
It's up to you. Mary....
Meredith. the blacksmith may be a long time. I don't--
Give me just 1 5 minutes. then I'll join you at the blacksmith's.
I cross my heart. Mary....
Oh. Meredith.
Jackie. you stay right here.
You stay with him every second while I'm gone.
-Don't you let him out of your sight.
-Oh. no. Mary.
Giddyup.
is it all right if...?
Can't we come in too?
I'm in.
Hey. who's this?
Friends of mine.
Friends of yours?
What in the hell are they doing here?
-l said they could watch.
-Otto. you know the rules.
-Ain't nobody-- l said they could watch.
Cut.
Five card draw. ante 25.
You on the poker wagon. mister?
-Mister?
-What?
Oh. yes. you might put it that way. yes.
Little woman make you give it up?
Well. we talked it over. but it was my decision.
You open. Otto.
Twenty-five dollars.
Like to see my wife ask me to quit.
Oh. I didn't say my wife--
Can't you just see Genevieve asking me to restrain myself from a nice. friendly little game of cards?
Twenty-five. and 50 more.
How long since you've seen that wife of yours. Denny?
Oh. I don't know.
Two. maybe three months.
You don't pay too much attention to little old Genevieve. do you?
-You're darn tooting.
-Why should he?
Any man gets himself married is automatically stupid.
Denny's just refusing to stay stupid.
He just don't ever see his wife.
Words of wisdom from the confirmed bachelor.
Confirmed and reconfirmed.
I hate women.
I believe you.
You've buried enough of them.
Sure I did. I put them back where they belong.
-Cards. Otto.
-Come on.
What's your hurry. Tropp?
You nervous I might bury you?
Get it. boys?
I'll bury him. and he's....
We get it.
-Two cards.
-Three.
Three.
Where you folks bound for?
San Antonio.
San Antone.
One.
Texas.
One. and dealer takes three.
San Antone. huh?
San Antone. Texas.
Oh. that's a long way.
Fifty dollars.
In.
We bought a place there. Plan to do a little farming.
And 50.
Ain't no such thing as a little farming.
Yeah.
Well. what I mean.
we don't have a big place a big spread. just a nice piece of land just outside San Antone.
-How much land?
-Forty acres.
Forty acres?
What you planning to do.
raise stinkweed?
Y'all listen. listen.
One whole year I've been honing my backside to sit in on this game and what am I doing?
Playing poker?
Hell no.
I'm talking about the stinkweed crop in San Antone. Texas.
Let's play cards.
I bet a hundred dollars.
You know what I give up to play in this game?
-A million dollars.
-No. more than that.
More than that to me. Mr. Big-Mouth Lawyer.
My daughter Ceely was getting married.
-Ceely?
-That's right.
When Tropp come for me. she was getting married.
And they're holding up the love. honor and obey part till I get back.
You walked out in the middle of the wedding?
I did. I ain't been late for this game in 1 6 years and I ain't about to start now.
I told them. I said. "You start late. and I may not be around for the finish."
The groom got held up by the flood in Baker Flats so the wedding was late getting started.
"When Tropp and Habershaw get here." l said "l'm walking out of this house whether Ceely's hitched by then or not."
Now. that's how much this game means to me.
Do you mind if we indulge in what I left my little girl waiting at the altar for?
Do you mind if we play a little cards?
I just raised a hundred dollars.
I don't think that's a very nice thing to do to your daughter.
Well. look who's mealy-mouthing me about being nice.
Old Mr. Tight-Fist-30-Percent-on-My-Money- Or-l-Foreclose Mr. Jesse Buford himself in the flesh.
Now. don't you give me no Sunday-school lesson about being nice.
Sit up and pay attention to this game.
Now. are you gonna call or ain't you gonna call?
Now. I got 300 United States dollars in that pot says that I got a hand.
That's a lot of money. I fold.
I got lots more.
I come loaded for bear. not chickens.
Let's play for money.
You're the one that said it.
And 5.
Beat three deuces.
Full house beats it. I guess.
You're an expert on the rules. Mr. Wilcox.
According to Mr. Hoyle. the rules say that a full house beats three of a kind.
-That's what they say.
-That's what I thought.
Horse shoes.
Oh. no. Henry. I am not lucky. I'm just skillful.
Yeah.
-Pardon me.
-Yeah. what do you want?
-You bet a hundred dollars on three twos?
-l bet the way I feel like it.
-ls this a private game?
-What does that mean?
Well. I mean. can anybody pull up a chair?
-Papa.
-Quiet.
-Pull up a chair. huh?
-Well. now....
-We got a rule about that.
-What's that?
You can pull up a chair. all right.
-How much is that? -One thousand dollars.
Cash.
On the line. Come on. deal. Otto.
Twenty-five dollars. five-card stud.
Cut.

-Papa. no.

-l said I've got a thousand dollars.
You got it. go get it.
-Right away.
-Papa.
-You mustn't take that money.
-Now. don't you worry. son.
Your mama knows all about it. I told her.
She knows all about it.

Papa.
Papa.
Papa. no.

Step up to the bar and have a glass of beer.
Keep your eye on him. will you? I'll be right back.
Step up to the bar. mister.
-Sam. how about some chips?
-Count the money. Sam.
-One thousand even.
-Give him his chips.
And I thank you. Sam.
Come on. son.
I bet his wife wouldn't give him the money.
You paid for it.
-lt's table stakes.
-l assumed as much.
-And Western rules on betting.
-Meaning?
Meaning you can't tap out if you ain't got enough to bet.
Just bow out. leave your money on the table.
-That's a rough game.
-lt's the game we play.
Good enough for me.
Then it's your deal. mister.
Been a long time.
Sure feels good.
Hi. son.
Wanna watch?
Wanna watch your papa buy us another 40 acres in San Antone. Texas?
Will it take much longer?
-Sorry. ma'am. what'd you say?

Why don't you wait for it?
Why keep betting on the bad ones?
-May I?
-My pleasure.
-Papa.
-Why don't you go get another drink. son?
Papa. when are you gonna stop?
Don't you ever get tired just hanging around?
-Why don't you go upstairs?
-Hey. sonny?
Why don't you come over here next to me?
You ain't gonna learn nothing watching Papa.
I can see now why your old lady made you quit this game.
Now deal.
-lsn't it time we had a new deck?
-Dealer can call for a new deck any time.
-Papa.
-Will you please be quiet?
It's a question of averages.
-The cards are due to break for me.
-Famous last words.
Pretty good mitt he's got there. huh?
Handles them cards real good.
Yeah. just like my old grandma used to.
Oh. he's a real expert mechanic.
Hey. ain't it great to see an artist handle them pasteboards?
Must have had a lot of practice.
Oh. takes a lot of practice to keep on losing the way he is.
Twenty-five dollars ante. five-card draw.
-Otto?
-l'm in.
So you were good to yourself?
He's got himself a hot one this time.
I bet he's got himself two dandy little deuces. eh?
-Come on. Ben.
Come on.
Ben. -Seventy-five dollars.
-Call.
-Call.
-Call.
-Call.
Dealer calls.
Cards?

Well. now. I'll tell you something. I'm just gonna have one little old card.
Any one of four particular ones you got left in that deck will do.
And you. sir?
Oh. I guess I'll just sit tight.
Well. now. what do you know?
He's got himself a big one.
Why. sure he has.
He said he would.
Watch out. boys.
He just might have himself five deuces.
Two hundred dollars.
What's the matter. mister?
It ain't hot in here.
Why. sure it is.
That is. if you got four aces.
He can't have four aces. I got them.
No. you can't have four.
I got three myself.
Well. I'll call that 200.
And I raise 200.
That's $400 to you.
And you know something. mister?
You ain't got enough left to stay in this pot.
And you know the rules.
We said Western style.
You just keep them there till I get back.
Don't let anybody see those cards.
-Hey. mister. Wait a minute. mister.
-Now. wait.
-Hey. -Now. wait a minute.
There's nothing in the rules about leaving in the middle of a hand.
So long as he leaves the cards here. Denny. So long as he leaves the cards here.
Well. boy. it's a good thing your mommy ain't here. huh?
She'd give him a what for.
What's Mama do when Papa loses all the bacon?
She push him around some. sonny. like a good little wife?
Who's bigger. sonny. Mama or Papa?
And who wears the pants?
Hey. wait a minute. boy. where are you going?
Hey. boy. come back here.
What are you doing out here?
-Did anybody see those cards?

Ain't you gonna count them?
You're sure you didn't let anybody see those cards?
Good boy.
Now let's get rich.
I'm in. gentlemen. I'm in.
He just bought himself 3000 dollars' worth.
Sam.
So the big gambling man from San Antone thinks he's got himself a hand. huh?
Well. I got some inside information for him.
I got one too.
And so have I.
-Me too.
-And me.
-Count me in.
-Sam!

He's still in that backroom. ma'am.
They're playing cards.
Mister.
Hear what I said. mister?
Mister?
I don't think you're paying strict attention.
What I said was. if you wanna stay in this game you better go upstairs and get 420 more dollars out of the sock.
-lt isn't fair.
-What isn't fair?
This rule about not being able to tap out of the game.
That's the rule. mister.
That is the rule.
Now. we told you all about it.
Well. you going upstairs?
-There's no more money upstairs.
-Now. ain't that a shame.
-Up to you. Tropp.
-Now. wait a minute.
You can't wash me out of the game. You just can't do it.
Now. look. mister.
First rule of the game of poker whether you're playing Eastern or Western rules or the kind they play at the North Pole. is put up or shut up.
You can give me credit.
-Meredith.
-Mama.
-Stay out of this.
-Look here.
-We don't allow no woman in here.
-Listen. I've got-- l've got this.
All right. I'll give you a hundred dollars on the watch. now you need 320 more.
In the name of heaven. what are you doing?
I say we ain't never allowed no woman in here.
-Shut up.
-But she's a woman.
-Shut up.
-That's a solid gold watch.
-lt's worth more than a hundred.
-No.
Just give me a minute.
Mary. Mary. listen.
It's not what you think it is.
We got a chance here to earn more money than you ever dreamed of.

Have you taken every cent of it?
But I know what I'm doing.
With this hand. I can't lose.
Trust me. Mary. you gotta trust me just this once.
-The whole 4000?
-But I haven't lost it. Mary.
It isn't as if I'd lost it. I'm investing it. I'm still in the game.
Mary. dear. listen to me.

You hear me?
Once in a lifetime.
Trust me. you just gotta trust me.
Trust you?
Trust you? God in heaven. how many times have I trusted you?
How many times and how many days and how many years have I trusted and trusted and sat and waited and wept while you played with cards that couldn't lose?
But you lost. and you lost until you got sick with losing and you swore by all that was holy that you would never play cards again.
And I trusted you. Meredith. but look at us.
You've thrown away every cent we've saved in this world.
All we've got is the team and the wagon.

But it's a brand-new team and wagon.
We bought it--

Meredith.

Who's dying?
-Well. this new fella came into town.
And he got into the game.
He's playing in the game.
In the middle of the game. he's on the floor.
And then they call us in. tell us to come get you.

-One. only one.
-Did someone bring the water?
-Water be damned.

-Go on now. drink it.

-You....
-The doc's here.
Come on. he's here.
Let him in.
In here. Doc.

Will you please...?
What's this?
The heart?
How many times has this happened before?
Madam. I haven't got time for bedside manners.
Now answer my questions and answer them quick.
How many times has this happened to your husband?
Once. Only once.
He ain't breathing so good. is he. ma'am?
Lend a hand.
Sam. where's the nearest bed?
And I don't mean upstairs.
We got no beds downstairs.
into the kitchen.
Clear the room.
-Yeah.
-Gently. gently. you clumsy....
All right now. boys. back to the bar.
Plenty of good liquor back in the bar.
Come on now. that's it.
-Come on.
-Meredith.
-Just a minute. please.
-Meredith.
I'd rather you didn't come in here right now.
I'm his wife.
His wife is the last person I want in here right now.
Be sensible and do what I say.
I'll let you in as soon as I can.
Now. you two stay here.
I may want your help.
What are you gonna do?
Whatever I can. madam.
I promise you. whatever I can.
-Doc.
-What is it?
-l just wanna ask a simple question.
-Well. what is it?
is he gonna be able to finish this hand?
Henry Drummond. for the love of....
Well. I was just asking.
How can you be so vile?
Now. look. lady. you got problems. all right.
I'm sorry you got problems. but I got problems too.
-l come a long way to play in this game.
-l'm with you. Henry.
For God's sake.
Look. a man's sick. All right. a man's sick.
Anything I can do about that?
No.
But I got a little girl sitting. waiting for her daddy to come home so she can get married.
And there's something I can do about that. I aim to finish.
I am getting a little sick and tired of hearing how much you give up to get here.
My daughter's wedding. that's how much I give up.
I give up a man's life.
You gave up what?
I was defending Owney Price on a charge of horse stealing when Tropp come for me.
I was fixing to make my plea to the jury when Ben busted in that courtroom hollering for me.
I give you all my word I'd be ready the minute he showed.
Did I let my duty as counsel for the defense stand in my way?
I did not.
I left that courtroom the minute Tropp showed.
I left Owney's head halfway in the noose when I walked out of that courtroom.
That's what I did to play in this game of poker.
But I ain't entirely forsook my membership in the human race.
I ain't worrying about a game of poker while that little lady's husband lays dying.
Well. that's the difference between you and me. let's put it that way.
The man's gonna die.
There ain't nothing we can do about it.
So I aim to finish this pot here and now.
And if he can't be around to finish....
What happens?
Tell her. Denny.
-We have to go by the rules. ma'am.
-What rules?
He loses the money. by default.
Oh. but that's every penny we have in this world.
Ma'am. your husband didn't take that into consideration.
Why should I?
You better come in. ma'am.
-How is he?
-Better come in.
Meredith.
-Mary.
-Oh. darling.
Mary. you--
-Mary. you--
-Darling. quiet.
-Mary. you....
-Please.
You....
What's he trying to tell me?
It's my guess. ma'am he's asking you to play the hand for him.
He wants me to play the hand?
All right. ma'am. you better get out of here now.
How do you play this game?
What'd you say. lady?
I asked you. how do you play this game?
You mean to tell us. ma'am.
that you don't know the rules?
I've never played a game of cards in my life.
-Sam.
-Yeah?
How is he?
Doc wants the shutter used to carry drunks.
Right.
-ls he all right?
-No change. ma'am.
Oh. what are you doing?
We're a long way from a hospital. ma'am.
Next best thing in these parts is my house where my equipment is.
-Now easy. boys.
-Darling.
Darling.
Now. let's have no more talking. ma'am.
-Move along. move along.
-Wait a minute. wait a minute.
I wish we could stay. but I've got to get him to my house.
-Papa.
-Move along.
Papa.
Never mind the boy. Hurry up.
Jackie. Jackie.
-You go with your father.
-No.
Well. all right then. you sit over in that chair.
Gentlemen. I have no choice but to continue to play this game in my husband's place.
You're gonna what?
That money represents 1 0 years of scrimping and saving.
It represents our new home in San Antonio and it represents all our dreams of a decent future for our son.
I have no choice but to protect it.
And you have no choice. gentlemen.
And what do we have to do?
You have to teach me how to play this game.
I told you when she come in here.
But. ma'am. it takes years--
Let's not even talk about it.
It's crazy to even talk about it.
-Pour me one. will you.
Otto? -Women.
I say let's get her out of here.
-Hold it. Ben.
-Hold what?
Hold it.
I can explain enough to the lady to clean up the situation to everybody's satisfaction.
How in a big fat pig's eye are you gonna clean it up to my satisfaction?
Listen carefully.
Yes?
This is the way it is.
We're all of us holding cards. see?
And we. all of us. each of us. we think we got better cards than anybody else in the game.
-You follow me. ma'am?
-Yes.
Now. we're each of us so sure that we got the best hand that we're willing to bet on it.
That is the principle of the game. ma'am.
You make a bet you got the best hand.
I understand.
You bet money.
Mr. Drummond is correct.
I've got $3500 on that table that says that I've got the best hand.
Mr. Drummond here. he's got $3500 in there saying the same thing for him.
And the same goes for Mr. Tropp. Mr. Buford and Mr. Wilcox.
Everybody at this table is betting $3500 that he's got the winning hand.
Well. go on.
Everybody but your husband. that is.
That's the nub of it.
All your husband could throw in there was $3000.
Now. he's gotta get up another $500 to stay in or he's gotta bow out of the game.
is that clear. ma'am?
Oh. extremely clear. Mr...?
Habershaw. ma'am.
Mr. Otto Habershaw.
You left out something. Mr. Habershaw.
Tell her what happens even if he does raise the 500.
Tell her it ain't gonna be enough.
Because this pot's gonna get higher and higher.
I guarantee it.
He's right. ma'am.
And my name is Drummond. ma'am.
Mr. Henry P.G. Drummond.
Well. my husband offered to sell his gold watch and chain.
I heard him.
Maybe you heard me say. out of the goodness of my heart that I'd give him a hundred dollars on it.
He was also offering our team and our wagon.
Oh. any you boys wanna buy a team and wagon?
Gentlemen all. All such gallant gentlemen.
Yeah. we're gallant on Sunday.
This is Friday. and we're playing poker.
Now. you wanna play with us. you ante up $500.
Now. listen. Henry.
there's no need to insult the lady.
Oh. now. look. since damn when did you climb up on that big white horse?
Just because you're teasing yourself with some hot ideas for you and the lady after the game--
-Henry--
-Now. don't tell me.
I know you. so don't tell me how to behave.
Once a year. I come here to play poker.
I don't come here for a lot of sweet talk and la-di-da.
I didn't come to listen to you shoot your big fat mouth.
Now. hold it.
Now. just a doggone minute.
None of us come here to listen to a dogfight either.
Now. let's stick to the point.
You tell them. Denny.
And the point's very simple.
Now. you got $500 to play a man's game or ain't you got $500?
If you ain't. time's a-wasting. We wanna get home before the rainy season.
Yeah.
Will you accept an iou?
Ma'am. if you want credit from a businessman you have to come up with some real security.
is there a bank in this town?
-What was that again. ma'am?
-l asked you. is there a bank in this town?
The Cattle and Merchants Bank. right across the street.
-Come on. Jackie.
-Ma'am.
You bowing out of this game?
I'm going to the bank.
-For what?
-For money.
From the bank?
Directly across the street. did you say?
Lady. maybe you don't understand.
If we don't extend you no money. credit. how do you expect to get it from a bank?
On your team and wagon?
It ain't that kind of a bank. lady.
It just ain't that kind of a bank.
Come along. Jackie.
Just a minute. ma'am.
Ma'am.
Ma'am I don't like to be. like they say.
the lawyer for the devil but you just can't walk out of this room with them cards in your hand.
-Why not?
-Why not?
It just ain't poker. that's why.
It don't go by the rules.
You see. ma'am. while you're out of the room anything could happen. you could....
-l could cheat?
-Well. no. ma'am. What l--
Now. ma'am. I didn't say....
What I mean is. since you don't know the rules of the game--
Now. let me tell you something.
You may play poker for fun or whatever selfish thrill you get out of this horrid game but I am playing for my life.
My life. gentlemen.
And I have no intention of letting these cards out of my possession.
My husband gave them to me.
and I am playing for him and I will not relinquish these cards for any reason whatsoever.
-Yes. ma'am. but--
-And you will not force me to.
Now. it is time for the five of you to show one spark of human decency and allow one compromise in your silly rules.
Silly rules?
I think we can accommodate the lady and still keep everybody happy.
Oh. he's got another suggestion.
-l have.
-What?
One of us goes to the bank with her.
You. huh?
I'd be honored.
I raise one little point of order. ma'am.
Yes?
Are you willing to turn your back on them?
What do you mean?
Well. once you leave this room. you don't know what they'll do with their cards.
I trust them.
Seven. eight. nine. 1 0.
A lot of money. Mrs. Craig.
My money.
Oh. Mr. Habershaw. Mr. Drummond.
And Mr. Tropp.
Game over. gentlemen?
-No.
-Not yet?
Well. then something I can do for you. gentlemen?
The little lady you can take care of.
We come with her.
Yes.
Can I help you. ma'am?
Well. I'd like very much....
Oh. you're only the teller.
I am the teller. ma'am.
I'd like very much to speak to the manager. please.
Manager. ma'am?
We got no manager. but what we got is Mr. Ballinger.
Mr. Ballinger is the manager. and the assistant manager and the president and the cashier and the landlord.
Mr. Ballinger owns the bank. ma'am.
Then it's Mr. Ballinger I'd like to see.
Well. this time of day. Mr. Ballinger's always very busy. ma'am.
Can I help you?
I'm the teller.
She wants to see Ballinger.
Well. I don't guarantee anything.
Come in.
Ballinger.
Will you come this way. please?
-You want to see me personally?
-Yes. Mr. Ballinger.
Well....
Well. well. well. the game must be over.
It's still going on.
We're just taking a little rest.
No rest for the wicked. Henry. you know that.
And this is not siesta time.
This is an office. designed for the transaction of business.
The little lady is here on business.
We come with her.
Well. all right.
Back to your cage. Fleeson.
Sit down. madam. sit down.
is this yours?
Oh. yes. this is my son. Jackie.
Shake hands with Mr. Ballinger. son.
How do you do. how do you do?
Now then. madam. why do you under the protection of this brigade of citizens insist on seeing me personally?
Well. Mr. Ballinger. you seem to be aware of the poker game going on at the hotel.
I am.
For reasons too unreasonable to go into here. I happen to be playing in that game.
-No.
-Yes.
-ls this true. Otto?
-lt's true.
-l don't believe it.
-Oh. it's true.
All right.
I believe it. I don't approve of it.
Proceed.
There's a grand total of $20.500 sitting in the middle of that table right now.
-You mean in one pot?
-Yes.
-That must be a new record. Henry.
-lt is.
Twenty thousand. five hundred dollars.
-Good heavens.
-And it's my turn to bet but. you see. I don't have....
l mean. my husband and I....
Oh. how can I explain it?
We've put $4000 into that game and I have to stay with it.
I will not be forced out of that game.
You have grit. madam.
I always admire tenacity and grit.
But just how does your desire to stick with the game concern me and my bank?
I don't have the money to stick with it.
I see.
What collateral do you have to offer?
On what do you propose to borrow this money?
On this.
Well. it must be a good hand.
Isn't it a good hand?
Isn't it a very good hand of poker?
Don't you know?
No. I'm only taking my husband's word for it.
Your husband's word?
-Well. he took sick.
-Sick?
Well. he was playing the hand. and then he had a....
Now. please don't make me try to explain it. because I can't.
But. now. isn't that a good hand?
Put those cards away. young woman.
-What?
-Put them away.
-Otto. this is one of your jokes.
-No.
One of yours. Henry.
Young woman. woman I've never seen before tells me she's involved in the biggest poker game that ever came down the pike.
That one was hard enough to swallow.
And then she tells me she wants to borrow money from my bank to stay in the game.
That's when I should have called Mr. Fleeson to have you ejected from the premises.
What was your next unholy revelation?
You offer your poker hand as collateral for the money.
Pelion on Ossa. madam.
Pelion on Ossa.
A quotation from the Greek poets.
It means when you pile one mountain on top of another one horrendous glob of flummery on top of another.
Now. young woman you have the bile and the gall to tell me you don't know about poker.
All right. the joke is over.
As for me. I'm a busy man.
-You've got it all wrong. Ballinger.
-You got me all wrong. Otto Habershaw.
At compound interest.
They didn't take the trouble to tell you. when they put you up to this that C.P. Ballinger is the kind of man who can't tolerate liquor. cards or women. reading from left to right.
And I would appreciate it if you and your fun-loving friends would remove yourselves from the premises.
Fleeson!
What happened?
What happened?
What happened?
Ma'am?
Did you get the money. ma'am?
Huh. ma'am?
If you'd asked us. ma'am. we'd have told you.
If you wanna borrow money from C.P. Ballinger you gotta at least come up with a second mortgage.
All right. Ben. let's play cards.
Come on. Ben. she's out of the game.
If I ain't being too nosy. ma'am just what kind of collateral did you offer Ballinger?
She asked Ballinger to lend money on the hand she's holding.
She- - She what?
Yeah.
Hey. C.P.. how much interest would you charge me on an inside straight?
Hey. me too. C.P. How about 6 percent on a dandy little flush?
So it was a joke. wasn't it?
I came over to see for myself.
It was no joke.
Then what's so funny?
It ain't funny. C.P.
Don't tell me.
I told you before. I'll tell you again.
Ballinger. lt was no joke.
The lady meant it.
That's what these damn fools are laughing at. if you really wanna know.
It isn't me they're laughing at?
Hell no. C.P.
It'd be dangerous for any man in this room to be laughing at you.
Now. wouldn't it. C.P.?
That it would.
Dennis. that it would.
With quarterly mortgage payment time coming up.
-You.
Sam Rhine.
-Yes. sir?
What'd I make you do before I gave you the mortgage on your house?
-You made me fix the cellar.
-Correct.
Give me collateral with a solid foundation or don't ask me for money.
Forty-six years ago I started lending money in Larry Bingham's backroom.
My first customer was a drover named Penney.
Wanted $2 on a brindled cow at 6 percent interest.
Said she gave 6 quarts of milk a day.
You know what I made him do?
I made him move that cow into my backyard for a whole week.
And I watched him milk her every day.
Sure enough. she gave an average of 6 and a half quarts a day.
So I gave him the money. at 6 and a half percent interest.
Not only that. I kept the 60 pounds of manure she left behind.
Show me collateral. madam. You better make sure it's good collateral.
Forty-six years I've been lending money on good old-fashioned principles.
And I stand here now to tell you one and all that I've never been offered a better piece of collateral than I hold in my hand right now. Chair.
What did you say?
You heard me. Henry Drummond.
Keep them close to the vest. madam.
Close to your vest.
Nobody sees those cards but you and C.P. Ballinger.
Sam?
-Yes. sir?
-Bring some chips in here.
Lots of chips.
Yes. sir.
Hold this. son.
I don't like to sweat in a new hat.
Just blues. please.
Blues are a hundred dollars apiece. I presume.
Make it 55 to start with.
Don't go away.
Now. how much did you say you needed to stick. madam?
She needs $500.
Five hundred.
Four. five.
Now. let's play some poker.
The good old-fashioned way.
Let's you and me and the Cattle and Merchants Bank just raise the bet once again.
You gentlemen want to stay in the game you'll have to put in another 5000 apiece.
Of course. you understand there's the usual interest charge. 7 percent.
Make it 6.
Lend a hand. sonny.
-l've won?
-That you have. madam.
That you have.
If you don't mind. ma'am. could I take a look at your cards?
Mr. Buford. the game is called poker.
The lady doesn't have to show her hand.
-You ought to read the rules sometime.
-How true.
-Sam. cash me in. I'm going home.
-Yes. sir. Mr. Wilcox.
-Home?
-Yeah. home.
To my wife.
Coming. Ben?
The Cattle and Merchants lent you a sum total of $5500.
At 6 percent. that makes another $330.
-Now. how did you care to pay that off?
-Oh. right now. all at once.
That's the way to do business.
Now. if I may escort you to the lobby. madam we can exchange these chips for cash.
Oh. will it take very long?
But one minute. madam.
Only one minute.
-Well. because I want to see my husband.
-Toby...
-...get a buggy ready.
-Right away. Mr. Ballinger.
Ma'am.
It's been a pleasure. ma'am.
A very great pleasure.
Shut up.
-To Doc Scully's you say. madam?
-Yes. and can we hurry. please?
Be there in a jiffy.
-Let's go. sonny.
-Giddyup.
-Henry.
-Yeah?
How many good women have you met in your life?
I mean good women.
Otto?
One.
Papa.
Mama!
Henry!
How was it. Pa?
Welcome home. Henry.
Welcome home.
-Mama.
-Oh. I told you he'd be back.
Hello there. Drummond.
Welcome. Mr. Drummond.
Dad.
Oh. Papa.
Papa. Pa.
-Who won?
-You shut up.
What'd you do. sleep in that dress?
She ain't had it off since you left. Henry.
That'd be bad luck.
All right. everybody.
let's get ready now.
Mr. Monckton. first thing. let everybody know...
-...that Henry's home-- -Now. just a minute.
-Henry. we've got a lot to do.
-You got nothing to do till I tell you.
You. come with me.
I said. come with me.
Yes. Mr. Drummond.
Dad.
Where are you going?
Well. what are you going to do?
-Mama!
-Henry.
Here.
-Sit down. Arthur.
-But l- l said. sit down.
-Yes. sir.
is this chair all right?
Sir?
Thank you. Mr. Drummond.
How old are you. Arthur?
-Twenty-six. Mr. Drummond.
-Ceely's 32.
-Oh. but I can take good care of her.
-Shut up.
I'm talking.
Never interrupt when I'm talking.
-What are you marrying her for?
-What?
Stop asking questions. I'm asking the questions.
What are you marrying her for?
Well. Mr. Drummond. Ceely and me.
No. you don't.
You're marrying Ceely because your old man figures it's one way to get his hooks into my property.
I know it. he knows it. and you know it.
Now then. why is Ceely marrying you?
Because she love--
Because she's homely as a lemon and just as sneaky as her old lady.
And every man sets foot in this house needs just one look to figure it ain't worth 40.000 acres and a soft spot for the rest of his life.
is that what you were gonna say?
-Yes. sir.
-Now you're talking sense.
Arthur. I want you to light out of that window right there and shinny down the rain pipe. and get on my horse and get the hell and gone away from us and your old man as far as you can get.
And don't waste any time. Arthur.
There's a whole world waiting for you out there.
Good places and bad places.
Nice people and some not so nice.
Look them all over. Arthur.
Bide your time.
And maybe somewhere. someplace. you'll find a real woman.
A good woman.
Now get.
Why are you doing this. Mr. Drummond?
Find one that will love. honor and obey you. Arthur.
Find one that will comfort you in sickness and in health.
-Get.
-Yes. sir.
Find a good one. Arthur.
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.
Bar was so crowded downstairs. took me a long time to get a drink.
-Has the game started?
-Not yet.
-Ninety-four twenty.
-That's 9420 to you. C.P.
That's the stake and your raise.
And one-fifth of the net receipts. 3300.
One-fifth of the net receipts. 3300.
That's 3300 to you. Ruby.
Thirty-three hundred to you. Doc.
And for me. and 3300 for Jackie.
How about this citizen?
Can I pick a crew or can I pick a crew?
You can pick them. Benny.
Time for bed. big fella.
-Do I have to go to bed?
-Yeah. we gotta get up bright and early.
I promised your old man I'd get you back to the carnival in time for church.
Now. say good night to everybody.
-Good night. Doc.
-Good night.
-Good night. Ruby.
-Good night. honey.
-Give your mama my love.
-l will.
Howdy-do?
Howdy-- How do you do. how do you do?
I want to thank you. C.P. for cutting me in on this deal.
You were Ruby's choice.
And a very happy one. my boy.
A very happy choice indeed.
Yeah. well.
-l have just one small suggestion.
-Yeah?
I wouldn't show my face around Laredo again if I were you.
If any of them suspicioned how we cheated them....
Cheat?
We didn't cheat them. we bluffed them.
That's the nature of the game.
I am shocked at you. C.P.
We may have bluffed them with a few extra trimmings but it was within the spirit of the game.
I am horrified that you think that we would cheat.
-No offense. -That's not the point.
Bedtime. Jackie.
Be seeing you.
What are you gonna do with your money?
Benny. you know Roscoe Busby?
Do I know Roscoe Busby?
Well. Roscoe come up with a proposition....
When are you going back to Laredo. C.P.?
Oh. tomorrow. the day after.
When do you go back. Joseph?
Who knows?
Doc?
What do you hear out there?
New Orleans?
Chicago?
After 40 years of fixing their chilblains and frostbite. bellyache and pip I figure they owe me this.
They owe me a little vacation.
-Joseph.
-Yes?
You gave a great performance.
Sweet revenge. huh. C.P.?
You bet it is.
How many years ago they cheated you in their real-estate deal?
Sixteen years it's taken me to get my money back.
But I've got it. I've got it.
What do you intend to do with all that money?
-Oh. you know.
C.P. -l do?
Well. we play big poker here in Black Creek.
Ruby.
-You promised me.
-Promised what. C.P.?
You said if I got you a big stake you'd give up poker.
I didn't say for good. Now. you know I couldn't do that.
You gave me your solemn word.
I did not. I never did.
Ruby. you're lying again.
Ruby.
Ruby. Ruby. come back here.
You know we talked this all over.
We talked. C.P.. sure. but I never promised.
You did.
You promised me on your word of honor.
Crossed your heart and hoped you'd die that you would never play another game.
You weren't listening.
You weren't listening. what I said--
What you said was that you would never sit in on another poker game if you came out with a big enough stake from Laredo.
Ruby--
Ruby. listen to me.
Why do you want to bring on those palpitations?
I'll bring on palpitations if I feel like it.
-Ruby.
-Honey. a girl's gotta have some fun.
-Ruby. please.
-Now. C.P.
What am I supposed to do when you're sitting in your big fat bank in Laredo and I'm waiting for you here in Black Creek?
I'm in. boys.
I only see you once every six weeks.
-Hello. Steamboat.
-Hello there. Ruby.
-Ruby.
-Quiet. C.P.
Let's play cards.
-Hello. Benny.
-Ruby.
-No limit poker?
-l assumed as much.
Western rules on betting?
Ante a hundred?
That's what I like to hear.
Gentlemen?
Doc.
Doc. they're playing.
So am l. my boy.
So am I.
-Five-card draw.
Blue 439.
Tell him I'm on my way, will you? Roger Wilco.
- Get that stuff developed, will you?
Right away.
Here I am.
Ready?
- I've been ready for nearly an hour.
I'm catching a plane for Paris at 11, so I can't--
Can't what?
It doesn't matter.
Who the hell were you with last night?
Reg, let's have some noise, can we?
That's good.
Hold that.
And the hair back. And the hair back.
That's great! That's good. More of that.
Lean right forward.
That's very good. And again around this way.
Touch the face again.
Marvelous.
That's great. Good.
Much more. Much more. Good.
On your back. On your back.
Stretch yourself, little lady.
Keep it up. Lovely.
No, no, head up. Head up.
It's Peter.
Yeah, I've got it somewhere. I know I have.
Reg, take down the address of that bloody junk shop, would you?
Why, they're fabulous. Go on.
You can burn that lot.
- Get the birds down, will you? - Okay.
No chewing gum. Get rid of it.
And not on my floor.
You, arm down.
Terrible.
How about the leg a little further forward?
Put the head up.
Mouth open. Yes, good.
No, you're all wrong.
Start again. Rethink it.
Stripes, let the dress just fall down.
Keep the stripes straight.
Just let your arms go up and down.
Yes, very tasty.
Yes, I like it. I like it. Go on.
All right, change position.
Wake up!
You can thank your lucky stars you're working with me, can't you?
And let's smile now. Come on.
Smile.
I asked you to smile.
What's the matter?
Have you forgotten what a smile is? Hey?
All right, you're all tired now. Go on, relax.
I can't see your eyeballs anymore. They're just slits.
Close your eyes.
And stay like that.
It's good for you.
Close your eyes.
That must be five or six years old.
They don't mean anything when I do them. Just a mess.
Afterwards, I find something to hang on to, like that--
Quite like that leg.
Then it sorts itself out and adds up.
It's like finding a clue in a detective story.
Don't ask me about this one. I don't know yet.
- Can I buy it? - No.
Will you give it to me?
Tight-faced bastard. He won't float me one of his crappy paintings.
I'll creep down one night and knock it off.
Don't stop, it's lovely.
You look tired.
I've been all night in a doss house.
They say they've been asked to come here.
- Not by me.
- Well, we weren't exactly asked.
Sorry, I'm busy.
They're printing some snaps for me upstairs. Go and fetch them.
Couldn't you give us just a couple of minutes?
I haven't even got a couple of minutes to have my appendix out.
- Well, when can we come then? - Don't.
- The others still waiting with their eyes shut?
- Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open.
Tell them to shut them again.
Get rid of that bag. It's diabolical.
Can we come back this afternoon?
- What do you want?
- Just looking around.
There are no cheap bargains here. You're wasting your time.
Well, I'll just have a look.
What are you looking for?
- Pictures.
- No pictures.
What kind of pictures?
- Landscapes.
- Sorry, no landscapes.
All sold.
- You the owner?
- No, the owner is out.
Expecting him?
What are you doing? Stop it!
Give me those pictures. You can't photograph people like that.
Who says I can't?
I'm only doing my job.
Some people are bullfighters... some people are politicians.
I'm a photographer.
This is a public place. Everyone has the right to be left in peace.
It's not my fault if there's no peace.
You know, most girls would pay me to photograph them.
I'll pay you.
I overcharge.
There are other things I want on the reel.
What do we do then?
I send you the photographs.
No, I want them now.
What's the rush?
Don't let's spoil everything. we've only just met.
No, we haven't met. You've never seen me.
- My agent saw you about this shop. - Did he?
He's a man with a cigar. Throws ash everywhere.
I expect I remember him.
I probably asked for too much money.
Money's always a problem, isn't it?
Tell him to come back.
Why are you selling?
I'd like to try something different.
Get off somewhere.
I'm fed up with antiques.
Get off where? To Nepal.
Nepal is all antiques.
Is it?
Perhaps I better try Morocco.
- What?
The propeller.
You can have it for... - 8 pounds. - Right.
- Have you got a van?
- You can't take it now.
I must. I must.
- I can't live without it. - Hard luck.
That'll teach you to fall in love with heavy things on Saturday mornings.
- Is that it? - That's it.
You can't treat it like that.
It's not a delivery van. - Who cares?
- Leave it to me.
Something will turn up.
All right, but it better turn up today.
Blue 439. Blue 439.
Over.
Get me Flaxton 2-249. Mr. Walker. Mr. Peter Walker.
Tell him I saw the junk shop. It's pricey, but the kid will come down.
Let him ring her right away, then... nobody else will get it.
Roger Wilco. Stand by.
Blue 439, message passed. The number stored.
Your caller doesn't like it.
Tell him to get stuffed.
What about all the buildings going up around the place?
Already there are queers and poodles in the area.
I saw some in the couple of minutes I was there.
- It'll go like a bomb. Over. - Blue 439.
What is in the area? Over. - Forget it.
Over. - Roger Wilco.
You want to use the lot?
Don't you like them?
They're great.
We'll use three or four.
Spread through the book? No.
All together.
- And a pint. - Yes, sir.
Which one last? None of this lot.
I've got something fab for the end. In a park.
I only took them this morning.
You'll get them later today.
It's very peaceful, very still.
And the rest of the book will be pretty violent, so it's best to end it like that.
That's best.
Rings truer.
I'm going off London this week. Why?
It doesn't do anything for me.
- I've knocked up a few captions. - Yeah?
I'm fed up with those bloody bitches.
I wish I had tons of money. Then I'd be free.
Free to do what?
Free like him?
Someone we know?
That'll be all right.
It's me.
Weren't you supposed to be going off to Hurley?
Listen, stay where you are. Call me soon at home.
I've come for the photographs.
How did you manage to find me?
Do you live here?
Drink?
What's so important about my bloody pictures?
That's my business.
The light was very beautiful in the park this morning.
Those shots should be very good.
Anyway, I need them.
My private life's already in a mess. It would be a disaster if...
So what?
Nothing like a little disaster for sorting things out.
Have you ever done any modeling?
Fashion stuff, I mean.
You've got it.
Hold that.
Not many girls can stand as well as that.
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.
You'll get your pictures. I promise.
I always keep my word.
Come here.
Show me how you sit.
Who is it?
That's right. Hold on a second.
Is it for me?
It's my wife.
Why should I speak to her?
The bird I'm with won't talk to you.
She isn't my wife, really.
We just have some kids.
No.
No kids. Not even kids.
Sometimes, though, it feels as if we had kids.
She isn't beautiful. She's... easy to live with.
No, she isn't.
That's why I don't live with her.
But even with beautiful girls... you look at them, and that's that.
That's why they always end up by...
And I'm stuck with them all day long.
It would be the same with men.
Have a listen to this.
Keep still. Keep still. Listen and keep still.
You can smoke if you like.
Slowly. Slowly.
Against the beat.
I can't stand it. I'm nervous enough as it is.
Can I have some water?
And I'm not a fool, love.
Can I have the photographs?
Of course.
Later.
Your boyfriend's a bit past it.
Why didn't you say what you want?
Get dressed.
I'll cut out the negatives you want.
They'll go.
They're not going.
Don't go.
- Have you bought a propeller?
You bought a propeller this morning, right?
You'll have to give us a hand with it.
What's it for?
Nothing.
It's beautiful.
If I had a big room like this, I'd hang it from the ceiling like a fan.
- Do you live on your own?
Perhaps I'll put it there like a piece of sculpture.
It'll look good there.
It'll break up the straight lines.
- Are you going?
- It's late.
Do I see you again?
Well, at least tell me your name or your telephone number.
Thank you.
What?
No, I'm sorry.
Ron?
Something fantastic's happened.
Those photographs in the park, fantastic!
Somebody was trying to kill somebody else. I saved his life.
Listen, Ron, there was a girl.
Ron, will you listen?
What makes it so fantastic--
Look, hang on, will you, Ron?
You weren't expecting us, were you?
- Can you manage to make a cup of coffee?
- I can make an Irish coffee, if you'd like.
Right, come on.
- She always like that? - Like what?
Doesn't speak.
What's your name?
Forget it. What's the use of her name?
What do they call you in bed?
I only go to bed to sleep.
Look at all these clothes.
- Hey, how about this one?
- Put it on.
What about you? Help yourself.
The coffee!
- What's the matter?
- She's got a better figure than me!
Right, let's move. Out.
- But you haven't taken any photos.
- No, I'm too whacked.
It's your own faults.
Tomorrow.
Were you looking for something just now?
Do you ever think of leaving him?
No, I don't think so.
I saw a man killed this morning.
Where?
Shot.
In some sort of park.
Are you sure?
He's still there.
Who was he?
Someone.
How did it happen?
I don't know, I didn't see.
You didn't see.
Shouldn't you call the police?
That's the body.
Looks like one of Bill's paintings.
Will you help me?
I don't know what to do.
What is it?
I wonder why they shot him.
I didn't ask.
Hello, Ron? Oh, hello, love.
No, I just wanted to take him somewhere.
where is he?
Okay, I'll fetch him there.
Ron.
Give me a minute, will you?
Someone's been killed.
Those pictures I took in the park--
I thought you were supposed to be in Paris.
I am in Paris.
Here. Have a drag.
I want you to see the corpse.
We've got to get a shot of it.
I'm not a photographer.
I am.
What's the matter with him?
What did you see in that park?
Nothing.
. .
Out of the way!
That was a full bottle, Herr Leutnant.
Yes.
- You've just met Willi von Klugermann.
- Yes.
- I see you've heard of him.
- Oh, yes, I have.
- You must be...
- He's tearing the wings off.
Let him celebrate, Ziegel.
He shoots them down. Your job is to keep him up there.
You must be the new replacement, Stachel.
Bruno Stachel, Herr Oberleutnant.
Are you the adjutant?
I fly a desk now.
Anti-aircraft fire.
Still, it could have got me higher up, couldn't it?
Yes.
Wait here. I'll tell the CO you've arrived.
And if I were you, I'd button up that jacket.
Ziegel, how soon can you have us ready again?
Depends on how many of the others have been hit.
I wasn't the only one.
I can't keep these barges flying for ever. I'm not a magician.
No, Ziegel, you are a magician whether you like it or not.
- Only 11 back, Herr Hauptmann.
- Yes. Mueller went down.
He didn't last long.
Fabian, how did we come to lose him?
I gave him the usual instructions, Herr Hauptmann, but he wouldn't stay with me.
Too, uh, too keen.
Oh, by the way, Scholte's replacement's here.
Leutnant Bruno Stachel reporting from 104 training school.
Your commanding officer, Hauptmann Heidemann.
Ah, yes.
Stachel.
Herr Hauptmann. - Stachel?
- Yes, sir.
Two years in the infantry.
Any rank?
Corporal, Herr Hauptmann.
What made you transfer to the air corps?
To fly, Herr Hauptmann.
Are you a good flier?
I'm... comfortable in the air.
Comfortable. Are you?
Interesting.
Willi!
Willi?
Very pretty flying.
I wish you would stop it. You'll live longer.
Sorry about that.
I see you are from Wiesbaden.
I've done some hunting round there.
- Who are your people?
- Herr Hauptmann?
I want to know something of your background.
What does your father do?
He works in a small hotel, Herr Hauptmann.
Five bedrooms.
Corporal, see the new officer's bags are taken to the mess. Herr Hauptmann.
Come into my office, Stachel.
Close the door, please.
I'm sorry if it bothers you about what your father does.
It doesn't bother me, Herr Hauptmann.
Then why are you so touchy about it?
Well, you're an officer now.
Your social problems are no concern of ours.
Take a look at the map, Stachel.
Our operating area is between Arras and St-Quentin.
The British also operate the area... as you'll find out.
What did you train on?
The usual machine, Herr Hauptmann. An out-of-date Pfalz.
That's what you'll fly here, too.
- But at flying school they told us...
- Flying school.
At flying school they'll tell you anything.
Up-to-date machines go to experienced pilots.
Both are in short supply.
- It's a cruel world, Stachel.
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
Welcome to the squadron.
The truck will take you to the mess with the others.
Let's hope you get to like us.
He could have been lying about the five bedrooms.
- His father was probably only a waiter.
- Just another snob, in fact.
Willi, there's something I haven't told you.
I have an uncle in the hotel business.
I admit he's a baron, and the hotel has 500 bedrooms, but you do see the position it places me in.
- Want a cigarette?
- Thank you.
You've got 18, haven't you?
Squadron rule number one, Stachel.
Gentlemen never parade their military achievements.
Any rule against saying how long it took you?
I would say that was covered by the same rule, wouldn't you?
No, I wouldn't.
How many rules are there?
I don't know.
None of them have been written down.
It seems you're next to me in Scholte's old room. Number 11.
Scholte?
Your predecessor.
He didn't last long, unfortunately. An unhappy young man.
Yes, he forgot to keep looking over his shoulder.
Worth remembering.
They come fast, out of the sun.
Thank you.
Willi, what do you think of him?
Gonna have a drink?
Oh. They haven't removed poor Scholte's card.
How very tactless of them.
I just thought you should know we don't dress for dinner here.
Von Richthofen, I see. Your hero?
He's done it all.
Two more kills, you'll have one of those.
Mm. A pretty medal, the Blue Max.
It's the only one worth having.
People respect it.
The medal or the man?
The usual routine, Fabian.
You know what they're like the first time in combat.
- Of course.
- Keep your eye on him.
Here - isn't it nice to hear the birds again, Herr Hauptmann?
Listen to that.
They won't be here long.
When our offensive starts...
- Good luck, Fabian.
What is it?
Stachel, fly on Fabian's left and a little behind him.
- Watch for his signals.
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
And relax. Get the balloon and come straight back.
You'll find balloons burn beautifully.
Switches on.
Is that Army Observation? Adjutant, squadron 11, here.
One of our pilots claims an SE5 shot down in sector five.
- Yes.
- Can you confirm, please?
Yes.
About 0700 hours.
- Perhaps Fabian made a forced landing.
- I don't know. Yes? Sector five, on our side of the line.
You did?
Fine.
Go on.
In midair?
- Did yours explode?
- No.
Yes. We do have a pilot missing.
- That'll be him, I'm afraid.
- Ask him. Thanks.
Goodbye.
- But...
- Only Fabian.
He never got out. No SE5.
But somebody must have seen my SE5 go down.
Not necessarily.
It often happens.
No confirmation, no claim.
That's a squadron rule.
But I saw it.
It was a kill.
Then you have the deep satisfaction of knowing you have served the fatherland.
It went down here, our side of the line.
Why couldn't the army look for it?
- They have other things to do.
- Somebody must have seen it.
Fabian might have seen it.
Corporal Rupp?
We're gonna search sector five. Get your motorcycle.
- But...
- Be in the mess in five minutes.
Herr Leutnant.
- Back to the mess, Herr Leutnant?
- No, I'm gonna search that wood over there.
- You already have, Herr Leutnant.
- What?
You searched that one an hour ago.
Well, we're gonna search it again.
What's the matter, Rupp? Too close to the guns for you?
- Thank you, Corporal.
- It's been a pleasure, Herr Leutnant.
You have finished your wild-goose chase, I hope.
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
- Found nothing, huh?
No.
If every pilot were to go careering around France looking for unconfirmed aircraft, there'd be no air force left.
And Corporal Rupp has more important things to do.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
"Unconfirmed by army" means "unconfirmed", and that's final.
Good night, Stachel.
Come and join us.
- Brandy, please.
- Champagne, Herr Leutnant.
Willi got his 20th kill today.
He's being awarded the Blue Max.
I see you've had a hard day.
No one's ever done that before about an unconfirmed kill.
Quite novel.
You must be in a hurry.
- To your Blue Max.
I don't suppose you've had an unconfirmed kill.
Oh, but I have. I've had, uh... three.
Then you've shot down 23?
No. 20.
By the way, Stachel, there's an impression around that you care more about your unconfirmed kill than you do about Fabian's death.
Perhaps it's force of habit.
In the trenches we couldn't even bury the dead.
There were too many of them.
I've never had the time to discuss them over a glass of champagne.
Well, never mind, Stachel. To your unconfirmed victory.
Next time you must have witnesses.
Witnesses. Good evening, gentlemen.
Pairings for next week's sorties.
- Let's have them.
- I'll fly with Becker.
Heller and Braun.
- Von Klinger and I will do the ground strafe.
- Gruber and I will fly together.
Good. Who'll fly with Stachel?
I'll fly with Stachel.
He's... he's bringing her in.
This one is dead, Herr Leutnant.
- Easy, easy.
- Bring a stretcher! Quick! Quick!
What happened, Stachel?
The observer. He was going to open fire.
Then we are to assume he was either very brave... or very foolish.
Confirmed.
It's a cruel world, Herr Hauptmann.
You said so yourself.
Bearers, halt!
I've read your report, Willi.
What really happened?
As I said, Otto, the observer made a move for his gun, so Stachel shot him down.
You wish to stand by your comrade.
I appreciate that.
What I reported is what I saw.
We are German officers. We'll fight with chivalry.
- You know that as well as I do.
The observer was blinded.
Did you know that?
No. It could have happened when Stachel opened fire over the field.
- But did it?
- I don't know.
But you do know how Stachel behaved when his first claim was disallowed.
If he's shot down a helpless enemy in cold blood, it's something I won't tolerate in my squadron.
All right, Otto. I agree. There is some measure of doubt.
But I have no reason to change my report.
All right, Willi.
The incident is closed. Officially, anyway.
Is everyone here?
All except Leutnant Stachel, Herr Hauptmann.
Someone inform him this is a parade. He is ordered to attend.
We are about to honour your dead.
So I see.
Well... aren't you coming?
It's an order.
Why?
Because our commanding officer has made it one.
He believes in chivalry, Stachel.
Chivalry?
To kill a man, then make a ritual out of saluting him?
It's hypocrisy.
If they kill me, I don't want anyone to salute.
They probably won't.
All right.
Let's get it over with, shall we?
Thank you.
You know, there's something of the cobra in you.
I'll have to watch you.
Leutnant von Klugermann.
Parade, stand at ease!
I assume you've talked to the other pilots about this.
Yes, I am making a thorough inquiry into the whole incident.
Good.
When the opportunity arises, point the man out to me.
Yes, Herr General.
- Ah, Otto.
- The squadron is drawn up, Herr General.
We were discussing the pilot who brought this in.
Air Headquarters are quite excited about it.
What's the man's name again?
- Leutnant Stachel, Herr General.
Is he a good flier?
Yes. Yes, he is.
Well, we mustn't keep my nephew waiting any longer, not to mention my wife.
Sorry to have been so long.
Were you bored?
With all these men around?
Look beautiful for them, Kaeti.
Look at Willi.
Doesn't he look splendid? The Blue Max will go so well with his eyes.
Yes, he is rather vain.
He'll probably wear it in bed for the first few days.
How uncomfortable for the girl.
- Excuse me, Herr General.
- Yes?
The second one on the left. Front row. That's Stachel.
Right.
"To Leutnant Wilhelm von Klugermann, for bravery of the highest order in action against the enemies of the German empire, and for exceptional services to the fatherland in that he has destroyed single-handed 20 enemy aircraft, the Order Pour le Mérite, by Imperial decree,
Wilhelm, Emperor."
I'm afraid it's rather a small medal, really.
But it's the highest Germany can give.
Thank you, Uncle.
Otto, this pilot of yours
- Stachel. Humble origin, risen from the ranks, et cetera, et cetera...
- Two years' frontline service, huh?
- Yes, that's right.
To deliver the final blow over your own airfield, on the doorstep, so to speak...
- That was splendid, wasn't it?
- Splendid?
Otto, if this young man lives long enough, he could be very useful to our propaganda department.
The common people of our country are war-weary, restive.
They need to be provided with a hero of their own.
Von Richthofen, Willi, are of our class.
This fellow Stachel is common as dirt.
He's one of them.
You understand?
Yes, I understand.
But I don't agree with killing helpless men.
Otto, this is 1918.
Things have changed.
Unrestricted submarine warfare, bombing of civilians, poison gas.
Ask your wife - she's a nurse.
Ask Elfi about the mustard-gas casualties.
So, you approve of this kind of ruthlessness?
We fight to win, Otto.
Yes, of course.
May I present Leutnant Stachel?
I saw the plane which you brought in.
Very... interesting exploit.
It proves that our young men still have vitality, courage, and the will to win at all costs.
Yes, Herr General.
Thank you.
I'm sure we'll hear a lot more of you.
Kaeti, you haven't met our Leutnant Stachel.
Stachel, may I introduce the Countess von Klugermann?
My aunt... by marriage.
You appear to have caught my uncle's interest.
Interest from high places is always welcome.
May I get you a drink, Countess?
Champagne.
Champagne.
Pink champagne!
- Pink champagne?
- Yes.
Yes, Countess.
May I have two glasses of pink champagne, please?
That champagne is getting warm, Stachel.
Not yet.
Silence, please!
Gentlemen... in a few hours the horizon will be lit up by the flashes of 7,000 guns - our guns.
They will herald the greatest offensive in history.
Our defeat of Russia has released a million men for the Western Front.
I need hardly tell you that if we destroy the British and French armies... before the Americans can intervene effectively, we shall have won the war.
God be with us!
Oh, Willi, darling.
Mm-hm? I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm not.
If you're looking for your nephew, he's next door.
Yes.
I realise that now.
As long as you're here, perhaps I can get you that drink.
Yes, do.
I'm afraid I'm out of champagne.
- Then whatever you have.
- Schnapps.
Horrible.
But quite stimulating.
So that's you
- Cobra.
- Cobra?
- Yes, that's what Willi calls you.
Has he been talking about me to you?
I asked.
He says you're quite, uh, deadly... in sort of a quiet way.
He's a romantic.
- And you're not?
- No.
No.
Tonight is a... family affair.
- Are you shocked?
- No.
- My husband is a very civilised man. - Mm.
And we are great friends.
It must be nice to have an understanding friend.
Oh, yes, it is.
Willi must be getting impatient.
Shall I announce you?
Please do.
Thank you.
Fire!
Come on, lads.
This is it!
Follow me!
The oil pressure's still too low!
Well, that's all you'll get out of her!
She wasn't made yesterday!
Oh, is that what it is?
You'll feel better in a few days, Herr Leutnant.
We've taken Bapaume!
That means we're closer to Paris.
- Thank you.
- I'm here to take you back to the squadron.
In there, Herr Leutnant.
- What are we celebrating?
- Your survival, of course.
And your tenth victory.
- You're moving up fast, Stachel.
- Too fast?
Does it hurt?
Then I'd better open the bottle.
Tell me, uh... never having suffered it personally... what does it feel like to be shot down?
Well, I'd rather you found that out for yourself.
You know, I was quite pleased at first - when you were posted missing, I mean.
Thank you.
Oh, it was just that, uh, all of a sudden, the war seemed a bit more peaceful.
And then - this is the odd thing - I had a sense of loss.
- I'm touched.
Seriously. I suppose I've had everything in my life too easy.
I'm inclined to be lazy.
I have to have a challenge.
I need someone around me who is, uh, hard to beat.
And you fulfil that role.
- How's the countess?
- Countess?
Your aunt by marriage.
Is she well?
I think so.
I should've thought you'd have known.
Oh, yes. She told me about coming into your room that night.
I knew you'd have to bring it up sooner or later.
The countess.
There's a fascinating subject.
I believe you have aspirations in that direction, Stachel. You should forget them.
I'll try.
But if the impossible happens... I'll buy you a bottle of champagne.
Will you?
It's vintage 1903.
You'll find it... hard to get.
1903?
I'll remember that.
Thanks for the champagne.
- That's the fool that almost got me killed.
- I believe he's a friend of mine.
Why don't you take it up with him?
- I hope it'll be a longer visit next time.
May I introduce the Baron von Richthofen?
It is an honour, Herr Rittmeister.
And I am very grateful.
1903 again.
You'll never change, Willi.
I'd like to have some of Willi's champagne with you, but I must get to my squadron.
I'm glad to see you haven't had to pay too high a price for my life.
I only lost an old Pfalz, Herr Rittmeister.
Perhaps now I'll get a better plane.
Oh, yes. You will.
My squadron is going to be equipped with the new monoplane Berlin's been promising.
I don't understand, Herr Rittmeister.
The baron wants you to join his squadron, Stachel.
I have no objection.
Well, what do you think?
I'm... very flattered by your offer, Herr Rittmeister.
Thank you.
But I'd prefer to prove myself here.
Oh, I see.
Well... I admire loyalty.
You are lucky to have this fellow, Otto.
Switches on!
Thank you.
Holbach, bring me that report from Von Richthofen again.
Yes, Herr General.
You're not shoeing a horse.
Get out.
I want him brought to Berlin immediately.
- Yes, Herr General.
- There is some difficulty?
I don't know what you have in mind, Herr General, but with the offensive at its height, there'd have to be a legitimate excuse to order him from the front.
He's wounded, isn't he?
- Yes, Herr General.
A mentionable wound?
- In the arm.
- Good.
People like soldiers to be shot in the right places.
Order Stachel to Berlin for treatment.
I want you to ensure that all our newspapers give full prominence to this gallant episode.
Photographs. Everything.
Yes, Herr General.
Yes.
I think I can get the field marshal to see things my way, with luck.
What you're telling me behind your jargon is that this machine is unstable.
Exactly. Herr Field Marshal, we require at least three more months to perfect the design.
By then, the war may well be lost.
Well, Franz, what more have you to say to the experts?
With your permission, Herr Field Marshal, I would like to produce an expert of my own.
We would like the benefit of your experience, Stachel.
You'll have read in today's papers about Von Richthofen.
This is the pilot concerned - Leutnant Bruno Stachel.
This way.
The new monoplane.
- Is it as fast as we've heard?
- Faster.
What about its manoeuvrability?
Only one wing - will it take the stress?
It will outturn any Allied plane at present in the air.
It could even turn the tide of the air war.
Then we must have it.
What if I told you that these gentlemen believe that there will be risks for you pilots if we hurry it into production now?
Well, we're used to risks, Herr General.
One more wouldn't make any difference.
Leutnant Stachel?
Tell me, do you think that your opinion would be shared by your comrades?
I am certain of it, Herr Field Marshal.
Let me see it again.
Nurse! Nurse, come quickly.
Come along, Herr Leutnant.
Frau Heidemann.
Leutnant Stachel.
Yes, I remember you.
I'm due back in a few minutes.
Oh, it won't take long.
The jacket, please, Herr Leutnant. And your shirt.
Frau Heidemann, those flowers, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sit down, Herr Leutnant.
Excuse me, please.
Excellent.
I saw how busy you were outside.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
Now, come along, gentlemen.
Along here.
Now, Frau Heidemann, if you please, it is just this one pose.
What will you put under the picture?
"Squadron commander's wife nurses wounded hero?"
Yes.
Please.
Very good.
Now move a little closer.
Hold still.
- The play-acting is over?
- Yes, Herr General.
We have finished.
Elfi, my dear. How good of you to have found time to come and help us.
- It was an order, Herr General, wasn't it?
- Of course.
It was a very important piece of play-acting.
I see.
By morning you'll be quite famous.
How do you feel about that?
Lucky, Herr General.
Tomorrow you will be making your way back to your squadron.
And tonight my wife would like you to dine with her.
That's very kind of her, Herr General.
Not at all.
She likes heroes.
Eight o' clock.
- You don't convince me, Colonel.
- Do you envy the birds?
- It may surprise you to know...
- Is that what makes men want to fly?
..that I am a serious student of military strategy.
- No, Baroness, I am not really surprised.
- Jealousy of the birds?
Yes.
Herr Leutnant, about the birds...
Thank you.
Good night.
A most successful party.
Pleasant evening.
- What's that?
- It sounds like a drum, Countess.
Good evening.
As this is my first opportunity of speaking to you tonight, I'll repeat it.
Good evening.
And good evening to you, too, good and faithful family servant.
Good morning.
That late? I must have fallen asleep during your speech.
Hans, some wine for the musician.
White.
Well, I suppose I might as well say it.
Say what?
You're beautiful.
- So are you.
And where is Herr General... your husband?
- Oh, he doesn't worry about me.
- He doesn't?
Well, he should.
By now he's with the Countess von Hoehlen.
On my right at dinner.
They play war games together.
Do these games go on until morning?
Sometimes.
My husband finds them very absorbing.
It's a very heavy responsibility being a general.
That depends how good you are at tactics...
Herr Leutnant.
- Your wine, Herr Leutnant.
Thank you, Herr Leutnant.
It has been a long day.
- Hans.
- Yes, Herr Leutnant.
I want you to go to your mistress and tell her I think I know what she means.
- Now, Herr Leutnant?
- Now.
Come in.
I knew you would come.
Darling, I am...
Tactics.
Oh, you fool.
There's a heap of letters in your room, Herr Leutnant, from all over Germany.
Any of them perfumed?
Yes, Herr Leutnant. There's one from Stuttgart.
- Towards the end she says...
- Yes?
Hello, Cobra.
How was Berlin?
Hectic.
I brought you a present, Willi.
A souvenir.
Kind of you.
I doubt if our tastes coincide.
Oh, but they do.
Glasses?
Thank you.
Excellent.
What year is this?
Uh... 1903.
We've tolerated you here because we've had to.
One of these days, Stachel... or should I call you Bruno?
One of these days I'm going to shake you up... considerably.
It will give me pleasure, Willi.
I'll look forward to it.
I wonder if you're as good as you think you are... in or out of bed.
Well, Otto?
Thousands of trucks carrying troops.
I flew over two miles of them.
And it's continuous, like the anti-aircraft fire.
Um... the new replacements. They've just arrived.
They're only half-trained.
I want every man in the air tomorrow, including replacements.
To sum up, then, our offensive has come to a standstill.
A massive enemy counterattack is developing.
The Americans are pouring men into the battle area.
Our army is hard-pressed.
We are outnumbered in the air, and our observation planes are shot down before they can report.
High Command urgently wants information.
Today I shall lead the squadron on a decoy mission to divert British patrollers.
Meanwhile, an observation plane will attempt a photographic reconnaissance of the area around Amiens.
I want two of you to provide close escort.
All right.
Rendezvous at 0800 hours over sector three.
You'll fly the two triplanes.
Take care.
They are the last ones we are likely to get.
Questions?
All right, gentlemen.
Did you meet my wife at the hospital?
Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
Was she all right?
She is well, Herr Hauptmann.
Thank you.
Where's Willi?
He's dead.
He was flying too low.
He hit the trees.
- What happened?
- He hit the trees!
I landed. There wasn't anything I could do.
He was a better man than you.
Well, he's dead.
- Is that your test?
- Yes.
And that was his test too.
- What do you mean?
- Herr Hauptmann.
Air Observation report two British planes down in sector nine.
Willi didn't die for nothing.
I'm glad of that, Karl.
We can tell the family.
They'll be proud of him.
What makes you think he shot them down?
You mean they're yours?
- Why do you think they're not?
- Well, are they?
Willi killed himself trying to fly me into the ground and went in instead.
I'm asking you if those two planes are yours or Willi's.
All right. They're mine!
They belong to me!
I just read your armourer's report.
Your guns were jammed. You only fired 40 rounds.
40 rounds?
Two three-second bursts.
Is your marksmanship that good?
Yes.
I'm not confirming these two victories, Stachel.
But I will report your astonishing marksmanship to Air Headquarters.
Firing party, right wheel!
Firing party, halt!
Left turn.
Order arms.
Otto, the general has asked me to tell you he's seen the report to headquarters.
The two victories claimed by Stachel are to be confirmed.
The general feels you are inclined to be prejudiced against this officer.
I hope the owner of this place is as discreet as he looks, darling.
He should be. I paid him enough.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
It's that bad, is it?
You'll have to decide which you prefer - this or women.
Why can't I have both?
You're soaked through.
You should take better care of yourself.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Don't you believe that?
Certainly.
But you were interested in Willi, too.
Tell me... how did you feel today at the funeral?
You know... he never did accept me as his equal.
In or out of bed.
You're deliciously crude, darling.
You amuse me.
- I?
- People like you.
The count.
Amuse, or shock?
I said amuse.
I adore your innocence.
You really believe your betters should behave better, don't you?
Don't patronise me.
Not if it offends you.
Darling? My feelings for you have nothing to do with the death of Willi.
You and I are alike, Bruno.
You're good for me.
Willi was a fool.
He didn't die in battle.
He died trying to prove he could fly better than I can.
- What?
- We played a game.
In and out of the trees.
He lost.
But I was the bigger fool.
I claimed two planes he shot down.
I shouldn't have done that.
I can get 20 victories without anyone's help.
That game, whatever it was, it was about me, wasn't it?
In a way, yes.
I find that exciting.
Would you die for me like Willi did?
No.
Are you sure?
It lasted about ten minutes.
They came in low. Sopwiths.
They hit the fuel dumps.
We are being blasted out of the skies.
I tell you, the fuel dumps have gone!
Now, Ziegel, let's get this mess cleared up.
I want to be airborne again by tomorrow.
Come on, Ziegel.
All squadrons have now been ordered to concentrate on the Marmont sector.
The enemy have just achieved a major breakthrough.
12 enemy divisions are moving up on the Marmont road.
They are our target.
There is to be no air combat.
No air combat.
Understood?
Yes, Herr Hauptmann.
Our army's in retreat so we must do the same.
Understood, Herr Hauptmann.
Your personal ambitions take second place to the war.
Hurry up!
They're closing in!
Fire!
Five... six... seven.
Come on. All of you.
Otto, are you all right?
You have cost nearly half the squadron.
We shot down seven planes.
Three of them were mine.
Now you have got 22.
You and I know that 20 wasn't enough for you.
The Blue Max is more than a medal to you. It's a badge.
Something to show you are as good as Willi.
Not just Willi.
I'll see you never wear that medal.
You disobeyed my orders.
I'm going to have you court-martialled.
Kettering?
Sir?
Escort the Leutnant to his quarters.
Your nerve's gone.
You've had enough.
Why don't you do what your wife wants?
- Get a desk job in Berlin.
- Come on, Stachel.
You've been ordered to Berlin.
Here he is.
- Goodbye.
- Herr Hauptmann.
Millions have been slaughtered.
For what reason?
For nothing!
I say "Down with the Kaiser and his generals."
The time has come now for revolution!
Long live the revolution!
Look out!
- My dear Otto.
- Herr General.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- Did you have a good journey?
- Yes, thank you.
Sit down.
Otto, tomorrow Leutnant Stachel is going to receive the Blue Max.
So you do not accept my report?
He is young, vigourous, ruthless, a born leader at a time when we need his kind.
I believe Stachel should be court-martialled for the good military reasons I set out.
Military reasons are sometimes not enough.
They are for me.
Otto, you and I have a greater loyalty than to the book of rules.
To Germany.
- We are Germany.
- Exactly.
Take a look outside.
You see that?
Revolution is just beneath the surface.
If that happens, everything we stand for will be destroyed unless the German Officer Corps stands like a rock, intact, and what is more important, untarnished.
I made this Stachel into a national hero for good military reasons.
If I court-martial him now it will reflect on the integrity of the whole Officer Corps.
Herr General, I see now I have notions of honour... which are outdated.
They're not outdated.
Stored with care... and love... for better times.
Here's your report, Otto.
I ask you to withdraw it.
- I won't do that.
- I know that.
If you insist on this course, Herr General, I must resign my command.
I do insist.
In that case, I should like an appointment with the staff here in Berlin.
That request is granted.
I have managed to persuade the crown prince to make the presentation himself.
Afterwards, Stachel will test-fly the new monoplane.
It would be better if you were there.
I understand, Herr General.
The keys to Leutnant Stachel's room, please.
Thank you.
Excuse me, please.
Stachel, come on.
This way, Stachel.
I trust you will be comfortable.
A lot more comfortable than I'd expected.
I thought the press reception went rather well.
I'll take your word for that.
The bathroom is through there.
How do you like your bedroom?
Oh, if there's anything you want - and I mean anything - just call reception.
- Do you understand?
- I think so.
Good.
I'll call in the morning to take you to the airfield.
Pleasant dreams.
Reception, please.
Reception? This is Leutnant Bruno Stachel.
I don't want anything.
- Have I come to the right room this time?
- Yes.
- Countess.
- Herr Leutnant.
- May I offer my congratulations?
- You may.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Please.
I hope you'll be able to be there tomorrow.
Of course.
I want to...
No, I want to...
No, please.
I want to talk to you.
- Talk?
- Please.
All right.
Talk.
I'm going away tomorrow.
Where?
- Why?
- Germany's finished.
The war will soon be over and I don't want to be here when it happens.
Is the general going with you?
No.
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?
I know you get your Blue Max tomorrow but we wouldn't leave till after the presentation.
I see.
- You will still have your medal, darling.
As a piece of scrap, it's worth exactly five marks.
You'll never need to pawn it.
I've got plenty of money in Zurich.
Don't you understand what this means to me?
In a few months from now, you will be ashamed to wear a uniform.
You're very stubborn, Bruno.
But if you want to see the war out to the end, I can get you transferred to a post near the Swiss frontier.
Field Marshal von Lenndorf is a friend.
How dramatic you look.
You can get me transferred, can you?
Do you think I came all this way to run off to Switzerland with you?
You gambled your life for me once, with Willi.
That was about flying, Kaeti. Not about you.
Run off to Switzerland and become one of your lapdogs.
There's nothing I want to run away from, Kaeti.
Not even myself.
Come on, now. Don't be angry.
Where's that aristocratic poise I like so much?
Don't you dare talk to me like that.
Now, Countess, I'll get you that drink.
Serve it to someone else!
The fatherland is grateful, Herr Leutnant.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Yes?
The field marshal said what?
I can't stop the proceedings now. It's too late.
All right, but where is the field marshal?
Ask him to telephone me as soon as he returns.
Get hold of Stachel. Take him somewhere.
Anywhere.
Just... keep him out of sight.
And, Holbach... send Heidemann to me.
Yes, Herr General.
- Herr General?
- Otto, I want you to fly the monoplane.
And Stachel?
There has been a little misunderstanding. It will be cleared up soon.
Without a court martial, I hope, Herr General.
Will you take the machine up?
- That is an order?
- Yes.
Very well, Herr General.
Thank you.
Someone else is gonna fly it.
- You said there was a technical hold-up.
- I think there are other difficulties.
While the general irons them out, he thought it best not to disappoint the public.
What difficulties?
I'm afraid I don't know.
- Well, who's gonna fly it?
- Herr Heidemann, I believe.
Frau Heidemann, how are you?
What's happening?
I thought you were going to fly it.
So did I.
I never wanted him to fly again.
Yes?
I will hold on.
You're late, darling.
Yes, Herr Field Marshal.
May I ask how you came by that information, Herr Field Marshal?
You told the field marshal that Stachel had claimed two planes shot down by Willi. Why?
Why?
Where did you get the information?
He told me himself.
He's an upstart.
He insulted me.
So this time you really lost your head.
The field martial is insisting on a court of enquiry.
They're going to disgrace him, an officer with the highest decoration Germany can give!
All because of your stupid little anger!
Do you understand?
Do you?
When they do that, they disgrace the whole German Officer Corps.
Yes, Otto?
What is it, Otto?
Herr General, that machine is a deathtrap.
The struts are too weak for the wing loading under stress.
I was lucky to get down alive.
Thank you, Otto.
Flight Office, please.
Holbach, I want to speak to Stachel.
Stachel, everything's in order now.
You can take her up.
And let's see some real flying.
Sit down!
Sit down.
Control yourself.
Switches on.
Give this to the field marshal.
It is the personal file of a German officer... and a hero.
Yes, Herr General.
Stand up, Kaeti.
We'll be late for lunch.
Pati!
You monster.
Nuru, you mustn't leave the drinks where Pati can get at them.
I'm very sorry, Memsahib.
That bad, Pati!
It's not really her fault.
You're not supposed to put temptation in the path of an alcoholic.
She's not a....
She's a rock hyrax.
Yes, and a disgrace to her species.
Anyway, we'll all have to be more careful.
-I'm sure it can't be good for her.
-Yes, but she likes it.
I know.
Now, where did I leave my paints?
Here, Memsahib.
Thank you, Nuru.
Will you take Pati?
Thank you.
Now, no more drinking.
I am Joy Adamson and for many years my home has been in the northern province of Kenya where my husband, George, was senior game warden.
One of his duties was to deal with dangerous animals who were a menace to either human life or to crops.
And we were on safari in the Boran region where a man-eating lion had been reported.
Look out!
You've been very successful, haven't you?
-Joy, can you spare a minute?
-Yes, I suppose so. What is it?
I've a little something for you.
-Do they belong to those two up there?
-Yes.
We had to kill the mother.
I'm sorry.
She attacked us and we didn't know why until it was too late.
Poor little dears.
Come here, darlings.
Careful!
One gave Sam a first-class scratch.
Not very good-tempered, are they?
Neither are you when you're hungry.
I don't suppose you've fed them.
No, I can't say I have.
You didn't pack any lion's milk for me before I left.
You didn't ask me.
Come on, darlings, never mind that brute.
We'll feed you.
We'll make you strong and healthy.
Come on.
Well, that wasn't a great success, was it?
But why don't they?
It's at least two days since they've eaten.
-They'll just die.
-Yes, I know.
It must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.
-We'll just have to try again.
-Right.
Back to the drawing board.
Formula....
Thirteen.
George, I've just been thinking about the cod-liver oil.
Do you think we put too much in?
Twenty-four hours later, they were still refusing food of any kind.
They were actually dying of starvation before our eyes.
Formula seventeen.
To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning to wish I hadn't brought them back.
Come on, darling.
Come on, sweetie.
What is it?
What are we going to do with you?
Why won't you eat?
Don't you see you'll die?
Come on, baby, there's a little sweetie baby.
My little sweeties.
There.
There.
A little nap and they'll be begging for more.
Yes, thanks to Elsa.
Who?
-The one who took the milk first.
-Oh, yes.
-But why "Elsa"?
-I don't know.
Well, I suppose I do really.
She reminds me of a little girl I knew at school.
She was the smallest of us all and not good at games but she was bright and brave and good, and I liked her very much.
-Her name was Elsa.
-Fair enough.
You're wonderful, too, darling.
After all, you're the one that did it.
Why, sure.
They said I couldn't do it, but I did it.
Formula seventeen.
You're a genius.
You really ought to put it on the market.
No.
You see, it would never work without one special ingredient.
This.
I'm not putting that on the market.
Even as babies, each had a different character.
The largest one, we called her the "Big One" was vain of her size and strength.
The second largest, Lastika, was the clown of the three.
But my favourite, of course, was the smallest, Elsa.
A weakling in size but the bravest of them all she loved to explore and investigate and examine.
And there were no limits to her curiosity.
In the wild, she would have been the throw-out of the pride for the smallest cub in a litter rarely survives.
But Elsa had no inferiority complex.
AII the cubs were, naturally, housetrained and always took great care to reach the sandboxes outside.
But, also naturally, there were a few accidents in the early days and when these happened, they were most embarrassed.
Unfortunately for Pati, very soon the cubs were too large for her.
At three months old, their teeth were big enough for them to eat meat.
And this soon meant that poor little Elsa never got her fair share.
So I kept the best bits for her.
George said he was convinced Elsa thought I was her mother.
Whatever she thought, she made me happy by following me everywhere and keeping me company while George was away.
When they grew older and needed more room to play we put Nuru in charge of them, and they got along beautifully.
Elsa!
What are you doing?
Go away!
Go! Get away!
Getting them out of their cage for their morning exercise was never a problem.
Come on, babies.
But putting them to bed was another story.
Come back!
-Come back, Big One.
-Come on, Big One.
Come back, Elsa!
In you go!
Come on. That's it.
Come on. Inside.
And you.
There!
Eventually, we had to ban them entirely from the house.
To make it up to them, we hung an old tyre from a tree and Elsa particularly fell in love with it.
They're beginning to look like lions now.
Yes, and to behave like them, too.
Don't I remember the father was a man-eater?
You don't believe that man-eating is an inherited trait, do you?
I don't think anyone really knows.
I hope you're ready for lunch, 'cause I am.
And hungry enough to eat a hyena.
John's just wondering if your cubs might start eating people one day.
You're joking, of course.
You know my lions are perfect little angels.
Yes, but they'll be very large angels soon.
Isn't it about time you thought of shipping them off to a zoo?
Is that an order, John?
You're touchy.
Have you been feeding him that lion's milk he's famous for?
Of course it's not an order.
But it's a good idea, isn't it?
Yes, of course, you're right.
We've already arranged to send them to Rotterdam Zoo.
-We're not ecstatic about it.
-Why? It's excellent.
He means we're going to miss them.
I know I will, terribly.
Particularly one of them.
Of course you will.
They're absolutely loveable at this age.
-Forgot to shut the gates.
-Heaven help the house.
Hurry!
Perfect little angels!
John, be a dear and get hold of Elsa.
-Be careful, she's not very strong.
-Neither am I.
No, you don't understand. She's delicate.
So am I. Let George fetch her.
Would you mind keeping your eye on her?
We'll be back in a moment.
All right, my delicate one.
Here I come.
-Joy, would you go back and fetch Elsa?
-Yes. I hope John doesn't scare her.
Steady.
Elsa, you naughty girl.
Don't you understand?
He's the boss.
I'm sorry, John, you must have frightened her.
Come on, come on, darling.
You mustn't be afraid of John. He likes lions.
AII too soon, we received word from the Rotterdam Zoo that it was ready to receive the cubs.
We padded and wired the truck.
And each day we took them out for a long ride in order to prepare them for the 180-mile trip to the Nairobi airfield.
I would leave Pati behind on these rides.
She was getting old now, and I kept her as quiet as possible.
-Look after Pati for me, Nuru.
-Yes, Memsahib.
-All right, darling?
-Yes, fine.
-Memsahib.
Pati....
-What's happened?
She's very sick, I think from heat.
I think she die.
She's dead.
When the day that I had been dreading came I went for a last walk with Elsa.
There you are.
Come on.
Come on, come on down.
This way. Come on.
Elsa, no!
Come away. Please!
Thank you, darling.
That's a good girl.
If it's any consolation, I feel as rotten about it as you do.
George, I think I ought to tell you that just now Elsa....
What about her?
Nothing.
Come on, love. Come on.
There you go, my sweetie.
-l suppose we do have to send them off.
-Yes.
All of them?
Yes, even Elsa.
Even if I told you that she just stopped me from walking into a great big cobra and that she knew what she was doing?
I'm sorry, it wasn't fair to ask.
Let's get the show on the road, as they say.
-Would you mind if I did some shopping?
-No, good idea.
-Can you cope?
-Yes, I think so.
I'll meet you outside Ahmed's.
-How will you get there?
-In a taxi.
I know it's silly.
I know she's not a human being. I know she's just a lion, but I wish I could stop feeling so miserable.
You will.
No, I'm just a fool.
I'm going to miss her terribly.
You won't, you know.
Elsa, sweetie.
Darling, thank you.
Thank you very much.
-Hello, George!
-Hello, John.
Good afternoon, Bwana Kendall.
-Where's Elsa?
-Elsa's not out here today.
Good.
-How's Bwana George?
-Much better now.
But that malaria was very bad.
Good thing he has strong medicine.
Yes.
Well, you don't look too bad.
I boxed with Nuru before breakfast, and earned a draw.
Good.
-Marvellous stuff, these malaria pills.
-Yes, if you don't overdo it.
I'm feeling fine.
Well enough for Joy to go out and you know she wouldn't go if I wasn't fit.
Quite.
What's she up to?
Having the Land Rover checked.
And in case you're wondering, Elsa's with her.
I don't understand why everyone assumes that Elsa and I have a feud.
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.
Actually, George, I wanted to talk to you about another lion.
You know, the one that's been snatching all those goats down in Kiunga.
I don't see why you have to travel all that way in your condition.
Why don't I send Ken, or one of the others?
No, I think I'd like some sea air.
If you can wait until I feel a bit stronger.
I don't mind.
A change would do you good.
But don't overdo it, will you? The best cure for malaria is rest.
I take your point, John. I'll rest. I promise you.
-Here, isn't that....
-Yes.
Come on, Elsa.
Come on down. Ride's over.
Hurry up. Let's go and see how George is.
Hello, John, how nice of you to drop in.
-Here's some letters for you.
-Thanks.
-How are you?
-Fine.
Good.
-Boxed six rounds with John this morning.
-Earned a draw.
How does it feel to live with the boxing champion of the world?
Marvellous.
We boxed two rounds this morning and I knocked him out.
Can you stay to dinner?
Or, better still, stay the night.
-I can do both. -Good.
I'll just go and warn the cook.
Poor darling, I've hurt her feelings.
Hello, Elsa.
Have a nice drive?
-Stop it, Elsa.
-Hello, Elsa.
Get down.
Why don't you go and say hello to John?
You know, I think I'm being snubbed.
-Now stop it, Elsa.
-I hope.
You're getting heavy, Elsa.
Stop it, you're squashing me.
Now, the question is:
What have I forgotten?
Tell you what I've forgotten.
I'm almost out of malaria pills.
Right.
Goodbye, darling.
Look after yourself.
And no boxing.
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.
-Goodbye, John.
Lovely to see you.
-Thank you.
Now I must say goodbye to Elsa.
Where is she?
On her car.
Elsa, I told you you couldn't go to Nairobi with me.
Have you met my wife who talks to lions?
Please, come down. Elsa.
-I'm afraid you'll have to help me, Father.
-Good old Dad.
Elsa, don't be such a lunatic.
Get down!
Get down!
Come on!
Come on!
Good girl.
Will you have another cup of coffee before you go off?
No, thank you.
What will you do with Elsa while you're away in Kiunga?
We'll take her with us unless you care to board her till we get back.
No, thank you.
You know, you're as much her prisoner as she is yours.
She's not a prisoner. She's a friend.
Yes, I know.
And there's probably no harm in taking her on a short trip, with reasonable care.
But your long leave is due soon.
Are you planning on taking her to England for a year?
No, it's a problem.
I've meant to talk to Joy about it, but I suppose I've been waiting.
Don't wait too long.
Look after yourself.
Come on, lunatic.
You're blocking the road.
John wants to go home.
All clear, John.
Thank you.
Now, look, Joy will be back tomorrow. You can't stay here all night.
Damn it!
Now you've got me talking to you.
Look, she'll be back tomorrow. I promise you.
Elsa, go away. Don't you sneak up on me like that.
It's very unpleasant.
Elsa, get down, you idiot.
I don't know.
Stop playing about.
Kindly give me the towel.
Thank you.
Now let's have my dressing gown back.
Come on. Give it to me.
Right away.
Go on, push off!
Hello, Elsa.
Did you look after George for me?
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, George.
-Good trip? -Not bad.
A bit dusty.
-How's Elsa?
-She missed her mom.
I did my best as a babysitter, but I'm afraid I'm not the type.
Do you know, she sat out here all night long waiting for you?
Poor thing.
And poor you, too, darling.
Come on, Elsa.
I'll find something nice for you.
George seemed so recovered from his attack of malaria that we left for Kiunga the very next day wondering how Elsa would react to the sight of her first ocean.
We reached Kiunga too late for anything except to make camp and then meet the local fishermen who had come to tell George about their troubles with the lion killing their goats.
Under the circumstances, Elsa's presence seemed to puzzle them considerably.
We were tired and had fallen asleep quickly.
But I was awakened by noises coming from near the cars and the kitchen.
There was no doubt that our cars, or our food were providing a great temptation to someone.
I didn't want to wake George.
He had looked so tired and pale when we arrived.
-George.
George! -What is it?
There's a lion out there.
I think it's John's goat-eater.
Don't be silly.
No lion would come into camp.
It's probably a hyena, or a leopard or something.
No, it's a lion.
I saw it.
I was out there by the cook tent.
What were you doing....
All right.
Go back to bed.
Did you see him?
Yes, I saw him.
Go to sleep.
Well, what happened?
I'd rather not discuss it.
Go to sleep.
What are you doing?
Getting a drink of water.
Look, will you or will you not go to sleep?
That's that. Work finished ahead of schedule.
From tomorrow, we play.
Marvellous watchdog you are!
Immediately after our first walk along the beach we all trooped down to the water's edge to introduce Elsa to the Indian Ocean.
At first she was put off by the growl and rush of the waves and the taste of the water.
And perhaps, by the audience we had collected and which was looking on from a safe distance.
But soon her characteristic curiosity prevailed and she enjoyed herself tremendously.
She loved playing almost any game George invented.
At the same time, she exhibited a talent for football that none of us had suspected.
It was a marvellous holiday.
Until one afternoon, Nuru came panting down the beach to tell me that something was terribly wrong with Bwana George.
I ran to our camp.
Let me get the pills.
Here, it's all right, darling.
It's all right!
Lie down.
There, that's all right.
Just give me those.
Yes, you see, medicine can be very good but too much medicine can be very bad, and he has taken too much and he has been too active, too soon.
He might very well have died, you see.
Indeed, I'm surprised that he did not.
Goggle fishing too soon, too soon.
He seems to be an impetuous man.
True. He's a mad, impetuous boy.
Then we must curb his impetuosity.
No more goggling.
No.
He must rest and then he will get well.
We'll see to it, Doctor.
Elsa will look after him.
She's a wonderful watchdog.
Yes. I see what you mean.
Goodbye.
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.
You mad, impetuous boy.
Like all holidays, ours was over all too soon.
And it was the last we would ever take together.
The time was approaching when our lives would be changed forever.
Elsa was fully grown now.
She had already been in season and was capable of having her own cubs and she started to realize there was another life than the one we had been living together.
A little later, our troubles began.
You okay?
Sorry, but I know that lioness.
She's a friend of mine.
-You're certain she's all right?
-Completely.
She and her friend Nuru came over to say hello and then went on for a walk.
But it's a good thing I spotted her collar or Mr. Watson might have claimed his first bag.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Adamson, I didn't know.
After all, you don't see a lion sitting in a tree every day.
No, I suppose not.
Actually, we're looking for elephants.
I've got my heart set on getting an elephant.
Well, we do get elephants here, but not for shooting.
I don't understand.
They come each year for the maize and Brussels sprouts which they love, and they're usually quite well-behaved.
They fascinate Elsa, I'm sorry to say.
This is elephant season now.
Really?
Do you think we might get to see some?
I shouldn't be surprised.
Memsahib, Elsa playing with the elephants.
Many elephants.
No.
Sorry.
Come along if you want to see some elephants.
Good.
Remember, they're just for looking at.
-No shooting unless it's necessary.
-l know. But let's go.
Come in the back, there's more room.
Okay!
A few moments later, when we passed through the shambles of a village we saw one of the results of Elsa's "playing" with the elephants.
As bad as it was, it was a great relief to learn that no one had been hurt.
But now I was dreadfully afraid that Elsa might have been trampled by some angry elephant.
And then we saw her very happily bringing home a two-year-old souvenir of the occasion.
And the damage, I'm sorry to say, is considerable.
The complaints and bills for crop damage, et cetera, are still coming in and will do so for some time to come.
The point is, I'm afraid, that you can't keep Elsa any longer.
I'm not responsible for the decision.
Don't you see?
Too many people know she was the cause of the stampede and from now on she'll be blamed for any lost livestock or damage.
Or for anything that any wild lion or leopard might do.
On the other hand, she might very easily be shot by anyone.
I think you were lucky the last time.
She's too big now to be allowed to roam about even with Nuru or yourselves.
And you can't keep her caged all the time that would only frustrate her and could make her vicious.
I'm sorry, but I think you've got to find some zoo that will take her.
I'm certain you'll have no difficulty.
She'd make a wonderful attraction.
Well, we've always known that she....
John I'm sure we can solve this in time.
That's the point, my dear. There isn't very much time.
Your long leave has come through.
How soon?
In a month. So, you see....
Well, why couldn't we take it here, in this country?
-George wouldn't mind, right, dear?
Then we could have time--
You know government policies for a completely different climate.
I'm certain we could easily find a good zoo for her in a month.
I don't want her to go to a zoo.
I want to set her free.
You can't be serious.
You'd be sentencing her to death.
You might just as well shoot her here.
He's right. She can't fend for herself.
She's never killed to eat.
She'd starve out there in the bush.
We could teach her.
You've waited too long.
It's never been done successfully.
We could try.
You know how intelligent she is.
We could teach her, train her.
George, please, let's try.
I'm sorry, darling. I agree with John.
Even if we could show her how to hunt and kill she'd never hold her own against wild lions.
I don't want to part with her any more than you do.
But what's wrong with sending her to a zoo?
Everything.
I know you think I'm being foolish, but I know Elsa.
We both know she'd be miserable in a zoo.
Don't you see?
She's been free too long.
I can't let her be caged for the rest of her life.
John, as a friend, give us just a little more time.
Give us three months to try.
Please!
Please!
All right, my dear, I'll get you your three months.
But you're wasting your time.
-Could I have another drink, please?
-Yes, of course.
If Elsa were to go wild, it would have to be in another district and we were able to get permission to take her to a reserve 340 miles away where there was abundant game, and best of all, many lions.
Whatever George's reservations were, he did his best not to let me see them.
And I was grateful to him.
Our plan was to spend the first week taking Elsa around the new country to get her used to it.
During the second week, we intended to leave her overnight and to visit, and, if necessary, feed her in the mornings.
Afterwards, we intended to reduce her meals in the hope that it would encourage her to kill on her own or to join a wild lion.
Elsa, what are you doing?
That is not your dinner.
Put that back.
On schedule, the day came when we took her out to leave her overnight for the first time.
Come on, Elsa, up you get.
Come on.
Come on. Today's the day.
If that's what I think it is....
Thanks.
Crikey. What a bit of luck.
Right off the bat.
What a handsome fellow.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
This could solve everything.
-Do you believe in love at first sight?
-I do now. I mean, I hope so.
-George, pray!
-I am!
So far, so good.
Why don't you get her down?
I think we should let her handle this.
All talk and no action.
Beautiful dialogue, though.
You're not funny, George.
I mean, we should give her more time.
-By all means.
May I smoke?
-No.
This could go on forever.
I think you'd better get her down.
All right.
Wait!
We could use a little more room ourselves.
Come on, darling, get down.
Don't be afraid.
I'm sure you'll like him.
Come on, Elsa, get down.
There's a name for girls like her.
All I can say is I'm glad you didn't behave like that.
I take it you want to try again.
-Yes?
-I was just thinking.
If there's anything left of that kill, and Elsa can get to it and with the fresh scent of lions on it, she just might get the general idea.
Well, that's good thinking.
I have a thought.
If we take the kill to that fellow back there and he thinks she's a good provider, he might get the general idea, too.
Right.
Now it all depends on....
Unfortunately, it turned out to be a large pride who thoroughly and unhurriedly enjoyed their family picnic.
It was several hours before we got to the remains of the zebra and take it and Elsa back to the young bachelor.
Luckily, he had remained near his tree.
But he was most annoyed by Elsa's ignorance of lion etiquette which calls for the lioness to bring home the food and then sit by until her lord and master has had his fill.
Poor Elsa, of course, didn't know that and was properly chastised.
That evening, we suffered all the agony of parents whose teenage daughter is out on her first date.
We returned the next day, only to find Elsa minus both the young lion and her food.
She was so forlorn and so happy to see us that I felt guilty about the entire episode.
We took her back to camp.
We resumed basic training.
According to plan, we'd cut down on her meals hoping that hunger would encourage her to kill for food.
But to Elsa, stalking other animals was just a game she never took seriously.
And she obviously enjoyed herself so much that it was difficult to be angry with her.
George continued to take her out every day, without result.
Then, one day, she suddenly came upon a warthog.
But Elsa's inability to feed herself meant that George had to leave the reserve every day and drive a very long distance to another area where the shooting of game was allowed.
-Tired?
-Yes, I am, a little.
Have a drink.
Yes.
As the weeks sped by we continued to leave her overnight as much as possible only to find her in the morning right where we'd left her hungry and pathetically happy to see us.
Then, one night just before dawn....
It was Elsa, and it was soon apparent that she'd had some kind of encounter with other lions, or perhaps a leopard, and had not come off too well.
Sweetie.
George.
I can't think how she managed to find us.
Yes, she does all the wrong things right.
Sorry.
After that, she refused to venture out of camp.
Nice.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
-Have you any idea what time it is?
-I left my watch in the tent.
No, I meant the time of year.
We've only two weeks left.
The rains will be on us soon.
Yes, I know. I know.
I've been thinking.
We've got to take Elsa out, and leave her for at least a week and we've got to move camp so that she can't find us.
Make or break, is that it?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
All right.
You've missed out that pretty bit over there.
Did I?
Yes.
At last, both the week and the rains came to an end.
Well, let's try this.
All my nightmares had come true.
It won't do.
Look, by now it's obvious she can't make it.
She can't fend for herself, mix with her own kind or do anything a wild lion must do to survive.
We've....
You've done too good a job on her.
We've made her tame, and it's too late to try to let her go wild now.
All we're doing is making her miserable, torturing her.
How can you be so cruel?
Do you think I enjoy it?
I don't know what goes on in that head of yours anymore.
You have this fixed idea.
What's wrong with a zoo, anyway?
Nothing, except that she won't be free.
-And is freedom so important?
-Yes.
Yes!
She was born free, and she has the right to live free.
Why don't we live in a nice comfortable city? Other people do.
But we've chosen to live out here because it represents freedom.
We can breathe.
-Because we're fit for it.
-So could she be! She can.
-She'll be safe in the zoo.
-Yes, safe.
And fat and lazy and dull and stupid like some cow on a milking machine.
Joy tell me the truth.
You just don't want to give her up.
What you're hoping is that she can stay out here wild but not too wild so you can see her every now and then. That's it, isn't it?
It's not the whole truth, but I don't deny I'd like it.
It's impossible! It can't happen.
Even if she should be able to go wild, which I doubt that'd be the end.
You'd never see her again.
Then at least she'd be free.
She wouldn't be in a cage for the rest of her life.
And if she gets herself killed in the process?
I'd never forgive myself, I suppose.
Although, at one time, we were afraid she would die Elsa did recover.
And when she did, she seemed somehow different.
Thanks to John who was wonderfully kind, despite his reservations we were able to get a time extension as well as permission to take her to another area only 35 miles from where she was born and where George could shoot wild game.
Now, as if she knew what was required of her she started going out alone, sometimes for days at a time only returning when she was hungry.
Then one day, when we'd followed her into the bush she caught sight of another warthog.
Well, there's no doubt at all whose kill that is.
Congratulations.
After that, she proved again and again that she could feed herself and so when she came into season we took her out for what became her most dangerous and final test.
No, don't.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stand anymore.
It's all right. It's really all right.
She's done it. She's crossed the bridge.
She's wild now. And free.
You should be very happy.
And proud.
We've....
You've done something no one else has ever done.
And you should be very proud.
I am of her.
Well, you might at least stop laughing.
-George?
-Yes?
Suppose we never see her again?
We will. We'll come back.
We'll come here as soon as our leave is over before we do anything else.
And we'll find out how she's been.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for everything.
We did go back.
We had only a week in which to find her.
We camped in the same spot, and went to look for her every day hoping that we would see her and wondering what she would be like if we did.
But we never found any trace of her.
Finally, it was our last day.
Wait.
Let's try just once more.
Nothing.
We start back today.
Elsa and her babies stayed with us all the afternoon and she made it quite clear that she was happy to be with us again.
I was dying to pick them up and hold them, as I had done with Elsa and her sisters.
But I knew that it would be wrong.
They were wild and it was better now that they remained wild.
Her master's voice.
Jump up, Elsa.
We saw her many times again, born free and living free.
We saw her many times again, born free and living free.
But to us she was always the same:
Our friend, Elsa.
They must not get away.
If necessary, shoot to kill.
Yes, sir.
Has something gone wrong, Father?
Why did NayIand Smith leave the seeds here?
FU MANCHU [IN VOICEO VER] : The world shall hear from me again.
michel.
Father.
Let him rise.
Why am I here?
Who are you?
-I am Fu Manchu.
-Fu Manchu?
It isn't possible.
You died.
Untie the girl.
Monsieur merlin, you and your daughter have been brought here because I require your assistance.
You can go to hell.
-Has she been prepared?
-Yes, Father.
Proceed.
LIN TANG: Now you have no will.
No desires but to please your masters.
You will obey only those orders we give you.
MICHEL: Yes.
Take this knife and place it at the throat of the man who is your father.
michel!
shall she kill him, Father?
You dare not, if you need my help.
Raise the trap door.
Tie Shiva to it.
Stop.
Ropes will not be necessary.
Shiva is the daughter of a man skilled in electromagnetic research.
Dr. Ramchand.
-Dr. Ramchand, but he is--
-He is dead.
I found I couldn't trust him.
Now I have no further use for his daughter.
You murderer.
One slash of the knife and she will join her father.
-And your daughter has the knife.
-She won't do it.
Even under hypnosis you can't make her do something against her character.
FU MACHU: michel.
Cut her free.
SHIVA: Aah!
Aah! MERLIN: michel!
michel, stop.
Stop!
-Aah! Aah! MERLIN:
It's me, your father.
MERLIN: Stop.
Did I do well?
I'II kill you.
-I swear I'II kill you.
-You will do exactly as I say.
Or do you wish me to bring your daughter out of her trance and tell her what she has just done?
It might be interesting to watch how such a young and innocent mind would accept such knowledge.
What do I have to do?
[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING]
-well, I'm baffled, Petrie. -Hmm?
It seems so senseless.
Why go to all the trouble of kidnapping if you're not gonna demand a ransom?
-They're all very beautiful women.
-White slave traffic?
Oh, no, they always go for unknowns.
These are all wives and daughters of leading industrialists and scientists.
It's probably some crank then, someone with a grudge.
No, it's too efficient for that.
They've kidnapped 1 1 women in 1 8 months in 1 0 different countries, Petrie.
And that means a big organization.
well, there's one comfort. There's been no kidnapping here so we don't have to worry about it.
Not officially, no.
Sergeant Spicer, please.
Sergeant, NayIand Smith here.
I want you to get me every scrap of information you can on these international kidnappings.
No, no. Not just the merlin girl.
I want you to go back to the very first one in Shanghai.
Get on to each country and see if they'II let me have duplicates of their dossiers.
well, cable them and ask them to send it airmail.
What are you up to?
I'm studying the enemy, Petrie.
The more we can find out, the more chance we have of catching them next time.
Next time?
We've no reason to suppose they won't do it again.
No, there's no reason to suppose it'II be here in england either.
I find myself almost wishing they would try it here.
As I told you, generating the energy was simple.
Our triumph was in transmitting this energy as sound waves.
From here, we can communicate with any major city in the world.
Monsieur merlin, look at this.
This is the model of the transmission aerial that the late Dr. Ramchand designed for us.
-And that is the receiving end?
-Yes.
That aerial captures the signal and passes it to--
What shall we call it?
--the wireless set?
The set, what does it do?
The same job as a wireless set.
Turns the signal back into its original form.
In our case, energy.
This is fantastic.
wonderful.
Heat, light, power, transmitted anywhere in a matter of seconds.
What do you use it for?
Bombs and shells create such a small release of energy.
-But this power....
-It is enough to destroy a city.
Your task is simple, Monsieur merlin.
At present, an explosion big enough to destroy a ten-story building requires a set twice the size of this table here.
That is inconvenient.
The sets must be smaller.
I can't do that.
No one can make even a small wireless set.
They have to be big.
On October 1 7th, you carried out a test for the Paris police in a field 1 0 miles from the city.
A motorcyclist wore a small receiver strapped to his chest and was able to hear clearly a message sent out from his headquarters.
That was only experimental.
You said at the time:
"It will soon be possible for cars and motorcycles to receive instructions and to reply to their headquarters with the aid of a small handset."
Remember, the snake pit is one of the quicker deaths that awaits your daughter.
MAN: What's been going on here, sir?
-We were attacked.
will you give me a hand with this young lady?
Attacked?
Who by?
I don't know, from that launch.
But they were here.
One of them is still unconscious.
Over there.
COP: One moment, sir.
You're not going anywhere.
This man is dead.
Look at this.
A Tibetan prayer scarf.
-Where did you get it?
-From the body of a dacoit.
He was killed down near Tower Bridge last night.
Look at that.
SMITH: One of Fu Manchu's men.
obviously left behind when he pulled out of here and went to Tibet.
He wasn't left behind.
I examined that body very thoroughly.
That man had been in a tropical country until quite recently.
He couldn't have been in London more than a month.
What about his clothes?
-The black tunic?
-almost new.
Now, tell me more. How was he killed?
A blow on the skull.
The man who did it claims it was an accident.
-Anyway, he's being held at Bow Street.
-Who's he? I-
- I'm sorry.
only it seems as though all this has happened before.
It's uncanny.
-What do you mean, Petrie?
-He's a research chemist.
A young German, just like last time.
-He's in here, sir. SMITH:
Thank you.
-Franz Baumer?
-Yes.
I'm from scotland Yard.
Assistant Commissioner NayIand Smith.
This is Dr. Petrie, Home Office pathologist.
Look, I have already told the police everything I know.
How much longer am I to be kept here?
I've read your statement.
Have you any idea why you were attacked?
No. None at all.
-There was no attempt to rob you?
-They wouldn't have got much.
No, no, it wasn't just robbery.
Why do you say that?
Why would they have the launch there? Huh?
Why do you think the launch was there?
well, I had a feeling they were trying to get Marie....
Miss Lentz, on to the launch.
The girl?
You're quite sure it wasn't you they were after?
Me?
What for?
-Lentz?
-Yes.
Who is she, Baumer?
-The girl I wanna marry.
-Her family.
well, her mother's French and her father is Otto Lentz.
What, the man who sorted out that hydro-eIectric disaster in switzerland?
That's him.
-Do you know where he is?
-What?
Oh, Germany, I suppose.
And the girl?
Is she just visiting here?
No, no, she's on the staff of St. Edmond's hospital.
Do you think it is Fu Manchu?
Can he still be alive?
I don't know, Petrie.
The important thing is to be in time to save the girl.
Save her?
If Baumer's right and it is the girl they're after, they'II try again and they will do it quickly before anyone can suspect the truth.
casualty.
What?
No. No one here at all.
Nurse Lentz?
Oh, yes, she's here.
Just a moment.
hello?
hello.
It's dead.
Oh, cut off from the switchboard again, I expect.
They'II ring back later.
-No rest for the wicked.
-Send them into Room 3, will you?
PORTER: Right.
Number 3, mates.
Here, where's the card?
What's the matter with him?
Can you tell me where the porter is?
Nurse Lentz. [MUFFLED GRUNTING]
MAN: What's happening?
Who are you?
police.
Quick, after those men.
[VEHICLE DRIVING AWAY]
-Are you all right, Petrie?
-Yes, yes.
Now, who are you?
Nikki SheIdon. I'm a friend of Miss Lentz.
What's happened to her?
An attempt has been made to kidnap her.
I'd have caught them if I hadn't been attacked.
I'm sorry, but two men had already attacked me in the corridor.
When you came through that door, I thought I had better get in first.
How is she?
They tried to chloroform her, but she hasn't taken much.
She'II come round in about 1 0 minutes.
It was Baumer's idea, this walk by the river?
Yes, but you can't think that he--
Marie, you've got to realize he can't be trusted.
You know what your father thinks about him.
I don't care what Daddy or anyone thinks.
I know Franz.
Can you tell me where I can get in touch with your father?
He's in Germany at present.
DüsseIdorf, isn't he?
Yes.
Why do you want to talk to him?
Because I'm putting a police card on you.
But that's silly.
It's a bit overdramatic, isn't it, commissioner?
I don't think so, Mr. SheIdon.
Now, Miss Lentz.
I want you to promise me that you will not set foot outside the hospital for any reason whatsoever.
I feel scared, Nikki.
Why should anyone want to kidnap me?
I don't know the exact reason.
Not yet.
But I believe that the man behind it is the most evil and ruthless man in the world.
If you are necessary to his plans, he won't rest till he gets you.
NayIand Smith.
So once again, our paths cross.
What instructions shall I send to London?
-tell them to do nothing until you arrive.
-When do I leave?
Tomorrow.
And this time, there will be no mistake.
And daughter....
merlin is ready to return to Paris.
He will go with you.
MICHEL: Father.
michel.
michel, I have only a few minutes before I have to leave for Paris.
-Am I coming?
Are we free?
-No, no, not yet.
There is some work I have to do in Paris first.
-Then I will be back in a week or two.
-What is this work?
What is he making you do?
[WHISPERS] tell me have any of the girls any idea where we are?
No, except that this whole place is all underground.
What do you know?
I don't know anything.
I was brought here blindfold.
I didn't see anything.
One of the girls is from Turkey and she knows something of archeology.
-And she says-- ABDUL:
Hey, you.
You mustn't do that.
She gave you something, it's forbidden.
-What are you talking about?
-silence, I saw her.
I'II search you.
[WHISPERING] Listen carefully.
-You're in the temple of Karna. -Huh?
ABDUL [LOUDLY] :
It's in your hands. Show me your hands.
[WHISPERING] You see....
Now, do you understand?
The temple of Karna.
Got it.
[NORMAL VOICE] He has nothing.
-Who is he?
-The girls call him AbduI.
He's the only one we can trust.
It is time to leave.
michel.
She does not even see you when I'm here.
Come.
-well, Spicer, what have you found?
-Not much, sir, but something.
Two weeks after the first girl disappeared from Shanghai, you remember? Her husband took a holiday in Athens. He was away for about three weeks.
The same sort of thing happened in all the other cases.
Within a week or two, the husband or the father took a holiday.
One went to casablanca, one to gibraltar, two to AIgiers one to Sardinia, two to naples, one to malta, two to TripoIi.
You can add another one to naples.
merlin went there too.
Why?
What does it mean?
It means, Petrie that somewhere in this area is Fu Manchu's new headquarters.
Look at all these towns. AII along the coast.
perfectly easy to smuggle a man out.
You think they've taken them from these towns to his headquarters?
Yes, I do.
We can't search half the Mediterranean looking for him.
LENTZ: Marie.
Oh, Daddy has just come in.
I must leave, darling.
Phone me later, will you?
In an hour or so.
My dear.
-well, at Ieast you look all right.
-I am all right.
That was Franz on the phone.
They have released him.
I'd have expected the police to show more sense.
Oh, Daddy, you're so wrong about Franz.
-Can I leave you here with Marie now, sir?
-Yes, thank you, Nikki.
Are you leaving, Nikki?
I must. I have an appointment in Paris tomorrow.
There's just time to catch the night ferry.
That's all, Louise.
There are lots of messages for you. And people want to see you urgently.
well, they'II have to wait.
I don't want to see anyone.
Nikki. Oh.
Why didn't you warn me you were coming over?
-Look at me.
-You look wonderful.
As always.
Is he in?
-Yes, but he doesn't want to see anyone.
-This is different.
Good morning.
welcome back.
AII right, Louise.
You haven't wasted any time.
There is no time to waste.
Now that you are becoming a member of wireless international we have to erect an aerial for you.
-You saw the model?
-Yes.
These are the plans for the tower.
The rest of the equipment will arrive from other of our members.
-Is that all?
-No.
It's been decided you'II have the first two small sets completed in five days.
That's ridiculous.
They will be ready and you will bring them to London with you on the 6th day.
I will look at the factory and choose the site for the aerial.
I'm sorry, will you be staying long, sir?
-ola, what are you doing here?
-cleaning.
CIean--?
Good heavens, is that the time?
hello.
casualty, please.
hello?
Nurse Lentz, please.
Changed her duty?
well, put me through to the nurses' home, will you?
This was a good idea, Nikki.
Not scared of bogeyman or the yellow peril?
No, not anymore.
I wonder why the police decided to take away the guard.
Who knows?
Program?
When did the police tell her this?
And she went straight out to the theater?
Yes, sir.
Yes. Thank you very much.
She left this for you.
She said she was expecting you to call her.
Yes. Yes, I know.
"Dear Franz, isn't it marvelous I'm allowed out?
The police phoned to say they've taken the guard away.
I tried to phone you.
Now Nikki is here and has got seats for the Lyric Theater Hammersmith.
So I will phone you tomorrow.
Love, Marie."
-She left with Mr. SheIdon? -Yes.
-He'd better take care of her.
-Thank you, nurse.
-well?
-They've found the constable.
He was strangled.
[QUIETLY] Franz, you go up there.
-You stay here, will you, Petrie?
The fire curtain's down. [PEOPLE CHATTERING, YELLING]
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
-What happened?
-Don't worry about me. They've got the girl.
hello, Sir Dennis NayIand Smith's residence.
No, I'm sorry, he isn't here.
No, inspector, he didn't say.
Oh, just a minute. He's coming in now.
-Inspector GrimaIdi, sir, from Paris. -Ah.
Thank you, Lotus.
hello, Pierre.
hello, my friends.
How is your lovely prisoner?
SMITH: Gone.
Gone?
They abducted her right under our noses in the middle of a crowded theater.
I thought she was confined to the hospital.
What about your end, any new developments?
Yes.
I have been told to drop the case.
Mr. merlin has very powerful friends.
well, that kills any chance of a lead from him.
Well....
UnofficiaIIy, I kept watch on him.
Just as well too.
We found he is going to London.
When?
He arrives tomorrow morning by the boat train.
I got his number, sir.
I saw who was driving.
Mr. Nikki SheIdon.
-SheIdon?
-I had my suspicions last night.
AII right, sergeant, you check that car and find out where merlin is staying.
What are you going to do, arrest him?
No, no, I can't do that.
There's no proof.
It wouldn't help us get Marie and the other girls back.
But you can't just let him go free.
The important thing is to find out what Fu Manchu is plotting and then stop him.
-Yes, but if--
-SheIdon is the first lead we've had.
But if he is working for this Fu Manchu he must know where the headquarters are.
-CouIdn't we--?
-You don't know Fu Manchu.
He covers his tracks and he trusts no one.
sheldon probably has no idea where the headquarters are.
Someone must know. There must be--
merlin.
-You said all the men were taken there.
-Yes.
But he probably doesn't know where he was taken.
Anyway, we can't force him to tell us.
Sometimes I wish I was back in Burma.
He'd have talked then, all right.
What do you mean?
Have you ever heard of the dust that loosens tongues?
I've seen it used.
The dust that loosens...?
Yeah. Yes, of course.
That's a crude natural form of one of the sodium drugs.
You have heard of it, then?
Drug research is my field.
I came across the Burmese drug when I was doing tropical medicine.
It paralyzes the patient, but he retains the power of speech and memory.
And he can answer only the questions you ask him.
And he cannot help telling the truth.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
-Monsieur merlin?
-Yes.
What do you want?
Mr. SheIdon asked me to call.
Oh, what for?
About these.
Very well.
Come in.
You are alone?
Of course.
-In here.
-Thank you.
Mr. SheIdon wanted you to look at this.
What happened?
Who are you?
What is your name?
jules merlin.
You have a daughter who was kidnapped.
Do you know who abducted her?
Fu Manchu.
Have you ever met Fu Manchu?
Where?
At his headquarters?
Where is it?
I don't know.
How long where you there?
Eight days.
And in that time no one mentioned the name of the place?
Yes.
Someone did mention it?
What is the name?
The temple of Karna.
The temple of Karna.
Good.
Now do you know what Fu Manchu plans to do?
He will dominate the world.
The new circuits have cut the run-up time by half.
We can hold the output steady at this load indefinitely.
But no higher?
We dare not.
That is sufficient for the Windsor castle.
Yes, but not any of the major targets.
Very well. Prepare for the Windsor castle in six days.
-The set will be in place?
-Yes.
And, Feng everything must be ready for the first major target on the 1 1 th.
Of next month?
Then we need Lentz here as quickly as possible.
He will be here.
-Anything happening?
-No, sergeant.
He went to lunch. Two of our men followed him.
He came back to the room an hour ago.
-Nobody spoke to or tried to contact him?
-Not a soul.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I have come to give you your final orders.
Are you the one who has been phoning me?
-Yes.
-Where is my daughter?
You won't get away with this.
If anything goes wrong you will not see your daughter alive again, remember that.
Now, your car will arrive at the front door at precisely half past which is six minutes from now.
You will be ready and you will get into the car at once and you will do exactly what the driver tells you to do.
But the police will follow.
Of course.
Remember, half past precisely.
And if you try to warn anyone the phone is cut.
-Who's that?
-One of the cleaners.
That's his car.
We didn't have any message of his going out, sergeant.
I'II follow it.
You ring the Yard.
They are following.
I know.
Get there as fast as you can.
This is ridiculous.
He's been driving in circles now for 45 minutes. Hmm.
almost as if he's stalling for something.
Look out!
POLICE DRIVER: Sergeant, look!
I'm sorry, sir, but they got him.
AII right, Spicer, you did your best.
But that flying tackle of yours was certainly worth seeing.
You were here, sir?
Yes, over in the clubhouse.
But for heaven's sake, sir, you could have stopped them.
They've got Otto Lentz, sir.
Have a look in the car, sergeant.
But I don't....
Who was that in the aircraft?
Franz Baumer.
Baumer?
He's been impersonating Lentz for three days.
Why?
Because we don't know where the temple of Karna is.
Now we're going to have a man right in there.
