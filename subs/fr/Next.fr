Dial the gate!
I swear, sir, I thought they wanted to smoke a peace pipe.
- Morning. - Morning.
- When is SG-1 due back?
- Hour and 22 minutes from now, sir.
- Tell Major Carter I have a message. - Yes, sir.
Incoming wormhole.
Receiving SG-1's identification code.
It's a code red, sir.
Looks like they're under fire.
Defence unit and medical team to the gate room.
Opening the iris.
Next.
I've been shot.
Some sort of... tranquilliser.
Steady pulse.
He's just unconscious, sir.
Classify P2X- 374 as unfriendly, sir.
Fairly primitive from the looks of it.
I presume Captain Hagman will need to be reassigned?
- I'd say so, sir.
- We'll debrief in one hour. Dismissed.
Major.
I got a call this morning from area 51.
It's done.
Jonas.
Major. How's Colonel O'Neill?
Partially torn ligament in his knee.
He'll be OK.
- Captain Hagman?
- He'll make a full recovery.
What does that make? Eight now?
Nine, if you count the two hours Captain Matthison lasted.
Right. So there's no need for Ancient Babylonian?
Not exactly.
Do you think you can spare a few hours?
- Sure. For what?
- You've been here three months.
General Hammond thought you might finally like to leave the base.
Yes. That would be great.
Where we going?
- Nevada.
- Clear skies, 73 degrees.
There are at least 500 other channels, you know.
But this one, this one is fantastic.
You have all of your weather from all over your planet right here.
Even long- range forecasts.
It's like... predicting the future.
- Well, there is some science involved.
- I know. What's in Nevada?
- Do you like surprises? - Sure.
I love'em.
Hey, Major?
How do I know what colour to wear?
We call each other every morning.
I thought you'd like to see the prototype as soon as it was completed.
Wow. You're way ahead of schedule.
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry?
Dr Larry Murphy, Colonel Jack O'Neill.
This is Teal'c.
This is Jonas Quinn, the man who introduced us to the naquadria.
Pleasure to meet you.
In case there was some doubt about what I was just saying: no.
I'm sorry. To what exactly?
O'Neill believes you are going to request that we test- fly this aircraft.
Of course.
Sir, I wasn't around for it, but we're all familiar with your experience with the X- 302's predecessor.
Are you, now? Really?
Well, sir, I can tell you that this is a very different ship.
Sir, the X- 301 was a modified glider.
Now, while many of the 302's systems were retroengineered from Goa'uld technology, it is human built.
So was the Titanic.
This could be the most important breakthrough for Earth since the discovery of the Stargate.
- Why's that?
- It has four sets of engines:
air- breathing jets, modified aerospikes for high altitude, and a rocket booster.
You said four, right?
The fourth engine is a hyperspace- window generator.
Even Goa'uld gliders can't enter hyperspace.
They're too small to carry the Goa'uld version of the generator.
- Ours are much more compact.
- Because of the naquadria.
Jonas, this was possible because of you.
It's still a few weeks away from a practical test, but all indications look good.
If this performs the way it should, the X- 302 will be the first human- built spacecraft capable of interstellar travel.
The deal made by our...
I am aware of every aspect of the arrangement, Colonel.
Jack, come in.
Colonel, you know Colonel Chekov, the Russian envoy to the SGC.
We've met.
Colonel Chekov feels that as a symbol of our joint efforts, a Russian officer should be assigned to join SG-1.
Over my rotting corpse, sir.
Colonel?
I'm sorry.
Did I say that out loud?
I said I would discuss it with you and that you would give it careful thought.
And that I will, General. But I'm still pretty sure I'll say "Bite me. "
Colonel, would you excuse us?
General.
So sorry.
I'm sorry, General. You know I mean no disrespect toward you.
I know. I should have reprimanded you in front of the colonel, but I agree with your sentiments in this case.
Who decided every team has to have four people?
No one says they do.
But Daniel Jackson provided SG-1 with invaluable knowledge, linguistic skills, and, in my opinion, a very beneficial viewpoint.
One I think is important enough to replace.
- But not with a Russian.
- I agree.
But my patience is starting to wear thin on this matter.
I think I've given you a great deal of latitude lately, given the situation.
- Sir... - Jack.
You're off the mission list anyway until that knee fully heals.
Use the time to try and get some perspective.
Find someone qualified you can work with.
I'll have all available personnel files forwarded to you.
Dismissed.
Yes, sir.
- Major. - Yeah? I realised I never actually thanked you for letting me see the X- 302.
Well, General Hammond ordered me to invite you.
I'm glad the naquadria's gonna be useful.
- Yeah, looks that way.
- Can I see the plans for it?
Yeah. Hammond says I should give you what you want regarding the naquadria, so...
He's a man of his word.
I doubt it'll mean much to you without an understanding of our science.
Maybe you can recommend some related reading.
Yeah, sure. I'll type up a list.
Great.
Thanks.
You know, Major... I'm as physically fit as anybody on this base, and I've committed to memory almost all of Dr Jackson's work.
Everything?
According to the tests, I am able to learn much quicker than the average human.
All very interesting, but...
I wanna join you, explore other planets, discover new worlds, new cultures, help rid the galaxy of the Goa'uld.
I get the picture.
I can't stay here the rest of my life.
I can't go back to my planet.
They don't realise the threat.
I can help them by helping you.
I can also help finish what Dr Jackson started.
I understand why you wanna join SG-1.
And I'm sorry, but... I just don't see it happening.
He trusts you.
I believe it is you he must learn to trust.
How can he learn to trust me if he won't even speak to me?
He holds me responsible for what happened to... Dr Jackson.
I believe you are correct.
How can I even begin to make up for it if he won't give me the chance?
- This really a sport on this planet?
- Are you injured?
It'll take more than that.
Tell you what, if I knock you down, you gotta talk to Colonel O'Neill for me.
I'm OK.
I wasn't ready.
I'm ready now.
Little snack?
The universities of this great nation are getting lax in their admissions.
To whom are you referring?
I can be as diplomatic and open- minded as anyone.
Hammond is insisting SG-1 needs a sociopolitical nerd to offset our overwhelming coolness.
Have you considered Jonas Quinn?
Now, I know you've been practising, but I still can't tell.
Is that a joke?
He wishes to fight against the Goa'uld.
He's an ali... .. en.
He's an alien.
I don't think we need someone else on the team.
You, Carter and I can handle things just fine.
- You learned to trust me, O'Neill.
- That's different.
I do not believe it is.
Like me, Jonas Quinn may be an alien to this world, but he is committed to the Tauri's cause.
That doesn't mean I want him watching my back in battle, OK?
Unscheduled incoming traveller.
Bra'tac, what's up?
I am sorry I did not come sooner, Teal'c.
Drey'auc is gravely ill.
No need to ask. Go.
- I didn't know he had a wife. - Yeah.
And a son, Rya'c.
They were banished from their home on Chulak when Teal'c defected.
At one point, Apophis brainwashed Rya'c and tried to use him against us.
- Bra'tac's been looking out for them.
- Why didn't Teal'c bring them here?
Drey'auc wanted to stay with her own people, and Teal'c was away on missions most of the time anyway.
He tries to get home as often he can, but it's not easy for him.
- You'd never know.
- Teal'c's not exactly an open book.
Still, I'm usually better at reading people.
Major!
Why was I not informed about the X- 302?
For example, it might not be that obvious to everyone, but he is actually very upset.
How did you find out about the X- 302?
That is not the issue.
Article 3A clearly states...
The X- 302 has nothing to do with the Stargate.
The naquadria being used to power the hyperspace- window generator was...
- Unauthorised incoming wormhole.
- What now?
I'll take anything over this.
We're not receiving an IDC, sir.
In fact, there's nothing, sir.
What's up?
Apparently, nothing.
- Nothing?
- So it would seem.
- That's a twist.
- Gate's functioning.
- We're looking at an incoming wormhole.
- But nothing is incoming?
- As far as I can tell.
- The Goa'uld used that tactic before.
To block our escape while they attacked in ships. Yeah.
Nothing from deep- space watch either.
This doesn't make any sense.
To keep a wormhole open, you have to send something through - a radio signal, anything.
We're getting... nothing.
- Figure it out, Major.
I'll call the president. - Yes, sir.
Don't look at me. I got nothin'.
As you see, conditions are harsh.
But they have been safe here.
Teal'c They must be moved to the new outpost built by the Tauri.
All Jaffa who support our cause are welcome.
Drey'auc is in no state to be moved.
Teal'c Why did you wait?
As it is, I have brought you here against her wishes.
She has always been proud.
She refused to accept the new symbiote.
- Was one procured? - No.
She did not wish us to sacrifice the life of another Jaffa to save her own, even one who still foolishly worshipped the false gods.
- We would all choose the same.
- In the past...
It is not the past. The dissent we have bred has brought about many changes.
The Goa'uld no longer trust the Jaffa priests with their young as they once did.
Rya'c.
You dare show your face here?
She's dead because of you.
- Could it be a malfunction?
- It's possible, but highly unlikely.
Chances are, somebody dialled Earth from an offworld gate.
Wrong number?
Normally, the gate shuts down after a short time if nothing's entering the event horizon from the outgoing location.
So what do we do?
We wait.
To my knowledge, no one's sustained a wormhole for longer than 38 minutes.
Could whoever's behind this redial our gate just to keep us from using it?
I've programmed the computer to dial the Alpha site after the wormhole expires.
We'll be able to recall our teams and hopefully contact someone who can help.
It's still on.
38 minutes, give or take a few seconds.
How many is a few?
OK, now we have a problem.
She believed in you... in the fight you have chosen.
As you once did.
How long were we to live like this?
Are we all to die like she did?
Nothing has changed.
The Goa'uld can be defeated.
As long as we must carry symbiotes, we will depend on the Goa'uld for our lives.
We will find a way to be free.
My mother will never know this freedom you speak of.
She had no choice.
You brought this upon her.
You chose for the both of us.
Now, as any warrior would, I choose to avenge her death.
Everything I have done I have done for you.
Then I am ashamed.
For you have done nothing but bring pain and misery and, above all, false hope to countless Jaffa.
Then fire your weapon.
There's a rise in power being retained by the gate's internal capacitors of 0. 1*/*.
While there's an open wormhole, the value fluctuates anyway.
Not for the last 12 minutes, it hasn't.
Go to gate diagnostic screen four.
Normal. No incoming energy readings.
Increase sensitivity by 50 per cent.
What was that?
Could be interference in the line between the gate and computer.
There it is again.
Increase sensitivity by 200 per cent.
That's well within the margin of error for the sensors.
I know. Try it anyway.
It's a small anomaly, but it could be contributing to the power build- up. - But...
- Errors are random, Lieutenant.
Whatever this is, it has a distinct pattern.
Right.
Fight!
Or do you not consider me a worthy opponent?
You should be glad he does not, for if he did, he would snap you in half.
You have become skilled, Rya'c, but a true Jaffa warrior does not let grief cloud his judgment.
I choose my opponent as foolishly as he chose his.
Teal'c chose your mother's fate no more than he chose his own.
- We are all victims of the Goa'uld. - No, Master Bra'tac.
Rya'c is correct.
I have failed both he and his mother.
The boy passes judgment without having fought a single battle. Hm?
Fighting a war that appears unwinnable does not make one's cause less noble.
He cares more for dying than for his own flesh and blood.
So must all Jaffa, if any of us are ever to taste freedom.
We've detected an energy build- up. It's being transmitted through the wormhole.
Our sensors aren't calibrated to measure something this small.
- The iris appears to be holding. - Yes, sir.
It's likely slowing the energy transfer, but it's not stopping it completely.
- Doesn't sound so bad.
- Actually, sir, it is.
The gate itself is one giant superconductor, capable of absorbing huge amounts of energy.
If that capacity is exceeded, the naqahdah the Stargate's made up of will become charged and could explode.
How long?
A few days, maybe less.
We're calculating it right now.
Is there any good news?
Just bad and worse, sir.
We're talking about a blast 2, 000 to 3, 000 megatons.
Enough to take out Colorado.
The resulting environmental effects could destroy all life on Earth.
There's worse?
We have no idea how to stop it.
Let him mourn.
- He has grown to hate me.
- He does not.
Nor does he truly believe our cause is futile.
Drey'auc would not allow it.
Why does he speak as he does?
Self- doubt.
Since the day Apophis brainwashed him, he has believed his own mind is weak.
It is not true.
You were no different at his age.
After the death of your father at the hands of Cronus, fear almost consumed you.
Like Rya'c, it was desire for vengeance that gave you strength.
- Rya'c misplaces his blame.
- He directs his malice towards you because he believes you doubt him as much as he doubts himself.
Why would he believe such a thing?
Because you are his father and you have not told him otherwise.
Not so long ago... I was captured in battle, and Apophis took control of my mind.
He made me believe that I was once again his loyal first prime.
And I turned on my friends who trusted me.
Were it not for Bra'tac and the rite of M'al Sharran, I would have died... believing that Apophis was my god.
Whether you believe in me or what I have chosen to do does not change the fact that I have never doubted your heart, Rya'c.
You need never win back my trust, my son, for you have never lost it.
- Shouldn't we cut power?
- Won't do any good.
Incoming wormholes draw their energy from the offworld.
Major Carter wants to monitor the gate through feedback.
We can't use the Russian gate because there's already an established wormhole.
Energy build- up has reached 18 per cent.
There has to be a way to drain the capacitors.
- Still sexy as ever, I see.
- What are you doing here?
There's no point in building naqahdah reactors for Russia if there's no Russia.
The Pentagon thought you might need some help.
Not from you.
OK. Well, then, I'll get a coffee and a doughnut and wait for the big bang.
- That's just what I needed.
- Major.
This wouldn't be a problem if you had a working alien ship.
Hey! I didn't wreck it. The Goa'uld did.
And we barely escaped with our lives.
What good is being a part of this so- called Protected Planets Treaty if you can't even reach the Asgard when attacked?
Excuse me, sirs. I just got off the phone with Dr Murphy at area 51.
He says he can have the X- 302 ready to go in six hours.
- I thought it was weeks away from a test.
- We've tried everything else we can.
Our only chance is if we can contact the Asgard.
I'd like to volunteer, sir.
I'll go too, sir.
- You sure you're up for it, Colonel? - Yes, sir.
I'll have transport prepped and ready in 20 minutes.
- Shaq'rel. - Teal'c.
- It has been too long, old friend.
- It is fortunate you are here.
I have brought word to Bra'tac so he might warn you.
- Of what?
- The Tauri are in danger.
They are under attack from Anubis.
- I assume you were briefed?
- Briefly.
The target is Abydos, the closest planet with a Stargate.
You know our simulations for opening the hyperspace window were done in space?
- We have to leave the atmosphere.
- We have to leave the ground first.
- It'll fly, Colonel. I bet my life on it.
- Wanna come with?
Love to, but I'm needed here.
Yes. Yes, you are.
Even if we do manage to contact the Asgard, there's a chance they won't be able to help us.
What's your point, Carter?
I guess I don't have one beyond that, sir.
Thank you.
- You're missing the point.
- Can I have a minute?
I wish I had one.
Carter and O'Neill are taking off.
- That's what this is about.
- What do you mean?
I'm no scientist, but I have studied all the research done on naquadria, and Carter allowed me to see the specifications on the X- 302.
- And?
- It's not gonna work.
Really?
That's just what I was saying.
Who are you?
- Jonas Quinn.
- The alien with the wacky naqahdah.
Naquadria.
You are?
McKay.
Scientist.
Earth.
General... the instability of the naquadria increases exponentially as you attempt to extract more energy out of it.
This is even worse than I thought.
- If you allow this test to proceed...
- This is not a test.
If the X- 302 fails, this planet will be destroyed.
- I understand your position.
- It's not just my position.
You stand to suffer the consequences with everyone else.
If either of you have a more prudent suggestion on halting this crisis, I'm willing to hearing it.
Otherwise, I suggest we all cross our fingers and hope Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill can reach help.
- Cross our fingers?
- An expression of desire for good luck.
- Really?
- It's ridiculous, huh?
- Navigation.
- Check.
Oxygen pressure.
Temperature control.
- All check.
- Inertial dampeners.
Cool. And check.
- Engines.
- All check.
- Phasers?
- Sorry, sir. All systems operational.
Too bad we can't drive across the galaxy.
This handles like a Cadillac.
Colonel, Major, this is Hammond.
Jonas Quinn has voiced some concern about this mission regarding the instability of the naquadria.
Sir, the simulations we ran anticipated every conceivable scenario.
It's the inconceivable ones I'm concerned about.
The X- 302 has hundreds of safety mechanisms to compensate for anything that can go wrong.
Arming ejection system.
That's good, that's good.
That's funny.
Mission Command, all systems go, from Abydos One.
Copy that, Abydos One. Good luck.
Well... here we go.
- We have liftoff.
- Climbing.
Velocity approaching Mach 2.
10, 000 metres.
- Mach 3.
- Mission Command, over.
- Looks good from here, Abydos One.
- Abydos One, over.
Anubis has a weapon that uses one Stargate to destroy another.
If my information is correct, the attack has already begun.
- We cannot warn them.
- That is why I brought a ship.
If the attack has begun, a warning will do little good.
- We must find a way to stop it.
- I do not know the weapon's location.
Anubis has grown powerful, but still only defends a small handful of planets.
If one of those Stargates cannot be contacted...
It is most likely the origin of the attack.
Let us hope it is one of the planets to which I can remember the sequence.
Preparing for main rocket- engine burn.
Roger that. We'll re- establish contact after you exit the atmosphere.
Engaging rocket engine.
This is Abydos One.
Do you read?
Loud and clear, Abydos One.
Altitude: 500 kilometres and rising.
Velocity: 40, 000 kilometres per hour.
I'm entering the coordinates in the hyperspace generator.
- Roger that, Abydos One.
- Godspeed, Colonel, Major, from us all.
Thank you, sir.
- Let's do this.
- Engaging hyperspace window.
Abydos One, do you read?
We're still receiving your radio signal.
- I don't know, sir.
Mission Command, we missed the window.
Please explain.
The autopilot engaged and we veered off course.
Should we try again?
Negative.
Return to base for further evaluation.
Mission failure.
I hate hearing that.
Colonel, Major. Glad to see you're OK.
For the moment, sir.
They're still analysing the flight data recorder, but it looks like a 605- 3 error.
- Forgive me?
- It's the one after 605- 2, sir.
The X- 302 couldn't get a lock on its destination, so it auto- aborted. It's one of the built- in safety features.
- What went wrong?
- The hyperspace window was unstable.
We thought we'd compensated for the energy fluctuations, but apparently not.
I don't think you can.
Apparently, Carter and I could have been torn asunder.
The possibility was remote.
More likely is transportation to an unknown location with limited fuel, oxygen, and no way of getting back.
- Can this problem be resolved?
- We don't understand why it exists yet.
You're lucky.
There's no telling what an unstable hyperspace window could do.
The bottom line is, we're on our own.
Hey. How come you're not downstairs with the rest of the eggheads?
Not that you're... an egghead.
Well, you are, actually.
But in a good way.
I couldn't think down there.
They all kept looking at me for the answer.
Well, you do have a penchant for pulling brilliant ideas out of your butt.
Head.
Out of your head, when we need them.
- Not this time.
- You've still got two days to work on it.
Sir, I don't think I could solve this if I had a couple of years.
Carter, am I sensing fear in your voice?
- Yes, actually. A lot of fear.
- Well, stop it.
You're making me nervous.
What about you, sir? Any ideas?
I mean, sometimes you have a way of seeing things at... at their simplest.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go eat some cake.
Think I'll join you.
We're experiencing a widespread loss of power, sir.
I am Anubis.
Looks like a hologram projection.
Humans of the Tauri, your end of days finally approaches.
There will be no mercy.
Come on. Who talks like that?
Sir, this is Asgard technology.
He must have downloaded it from Thor.
You will bow to my awesome power.
There is nothing that can stop the destruction I bring upon you.
Prepare to meet your doom.
Oh, please!

Previously on "Stargate SG-1":
The X-302 will be the first human-built spacecraft capable of interstellar travel.
Colonel Chekov feels a Russian officer should be assigned to join SG-1 .
Over my rotting corpse, sir.
- l wanna join you.
- l don't see it happening.
There's an energy build-up within the gate.
The Tauri are in danger.
They are under attack from Anubis.
We're talking about a blast 2,000 to 3,000 megatons.
- There's worse? - We have no idea how to stop it.
If the X-302 fails, this planet will be destroyed.
Even if we contact the Asgard, there's a chance they won't be able to help us.
Anubis has grown powerful, but still only defends a small handful of planets.
If one of those Stargates also cannot be contacted... lt is the origin of the attack.
Mission command, we missed the window.
We thought we'd compensated for the energy fluctuations, but apparently not.
We're on our own.
Prepare to meet your doom.
Oh, please.
And now, the conclusion.
Has a real flair for the dramatic, doesn't he?
Very theatrical. Yeah. Pretty much all the Goa'uld are like that.
Why does the guy show up a day and a half after this starts to do his whole "prepare to meet your doom" thing?
Maybe he wanted to make sure it was gonna work.
That'd be embarrassing. "Nothing can stop the destruction I bring upon you."
Then the gate shuts down. "Oops.
Never mind."
Yeah, well, that didn't happen, and we only have 54 hours left.
(man) Major, can I see you for a second?
When the gate was connected, a shaped charge disengaged the wormhole.
- An outgoing wormhole.
- True, but... - The blast would detonate the gate.
- Wait a minute.
- lf you'd just let me finish...
- You're wrong, but you gave me an idea.
We know certain waves can travel in both directions through a wormhole.
- Radio signals, for one.
- We call Anubis up and ask him to stop?
"Hey, Anubis, this is your agent.
You're playing it way over the top."
- "Can you get serious?"
- You were saying?
We send a massive EM pulse back through the wormhole, knock out whatever is making this happen on the other end.
Will that work?
No. I already thought of it. I didn't mention it because it is far too problematic.
- More than the gate exploding?
- The iris'd have to be open.
- The gate room's shielded.
- Are you saying it absolutely won't work?
What I'm saying, sir, is that we have no idea how much EM would be required to knock this out.
So let's all just go home.
- How long will it take to set up?
- Four hours, tops. That's how long you have to come up with a better idea.
I have tried to connect to this world twice.
It is the only one which I cannot contact.
Then we must hope that is the location of the weapon.
I'm coming with you.
If the Goa'uld truly can be defeated, then I wish to be a part of it.
You said I could not judge this war, for l'd yet to fight a battle.
You've trained me.
Now let me fight.
- You said you did not doubt me.
- l do not. Then I will join you.
Be quick.
Very well.
Sirs, I've calculated that opening the iris will increase the flow of energy to the gate by at least ten times.
If this doesn't work, we'll be cutting half the time before the gate detonates.
No better idea yet?
No. - You and Dr McKay don't see eye to eye.
- Sir, this has nothing to do... I believe if this plan has any chance of working, it's with your cooperation.
- l know what I'm doing.
- (Shaq'rel) We are nearing the planet.
(Bra'tac) lt is guarded.
A good sign we have the correct location of the weapon.
There are rings on the surface.
We must hope to catch any Jaffa on the ground by surprise.
Right here.
You just wanna be able to take credit for it when it works.
- For the record... I hate you.
- Well, it can't get any worse, then, can it?
Oh, no. I'm rapidly working up to "despise".
We have to get over this physical-attraction thing if we're gonna work together.
I think I can act as though it never existed.
Shall we save the world?
Before I take the credit for this, shouldn't the EM pulse generator be pointed at the gate?
You're good. Very good.
Rya'c.
- You remain on board with Shaq'rel.
- Why? One day, you will be a great warrior.
This day, the danger is too great.
I am prepared to die.
I am not prepared for you to die.
- Two gliders in pursuit.
- How is it possible? Are we not cloaked?
Anubis must now have means of detecting cloaked ships.
I am decloaking and diverting power to shields.
- Entering range of surface rings.
- Teal'c. is it not equally dangerous on the ship as it will be on the planet?
Go. I will do my best to return for you.
Come.
Stay close.
The forces on the ground may have been alerted to our presence.
(Jaffa) ldentify yourselves.
We must move!
- That's it.
- We're ready, sir.
Close the blast doors.
Open the iris.
Energy transfer is increasing. Seven times greater. Eight.
- Go.
Yeah, go.
- Do it. Activating electromagnetic pulse.
Energy transfer is still increasing.
Look, if this was gonna work...
Close the iris.
We're off line.
She's not gonna be happy when she wakes up.
- Medical team to the control room.
- She is going to wake up, isn't she?
The path is well-travelled.
We must stay under cover.
Many gliders patrol the skies.
This wound is not small.
You must be in great pain.
Nothing I cannot bear.
You could easily be dead.
I do not understand.
There was at least eight of them.
- Ten. - How did neither of you get hit?
It is always more difficult to hit a moving target.
It is also helpful to be lucky.
There is little time to waste.
Hi. And I was just startin' to feel better.
Are you gonna be OK?
At least until the gate explodes, yeah.
Look, I... never meant for anyone to get hurt, much less you.
It's OK. We had to try something.
I always wanted to be a pianist.
- Excuse me?
- A concert pianist.
A guy who plays piano in front of people.
Right.
- What'd you think I said?
- Never mind.
I had a not-so-comfortable childhood.
My parents hated each other and blamed me.
Music was my salvation.
It had this perfect order for me.
That's nice. Really.
When I was 12, my teacher told me to quit.
A fine clinical player, he said, but no sense of the art whatsoever.
- Why are you telling me this?
- l'm just tryin' to bond.
- Why?
- Hospital gowns turn me on.
I thought science would be different than music, but it's just the same.
It's just as much of an art as anything else.
Look, it's not your fault that the EM pulse didn't work.
You're an artist, Major, maybe the best I've ever seen.
- l'm just critical because I'm jealous.
- l'm touched.
Really. I wish I had a brilliant plan to draw for you.
And you're funny, too. Even electrocuted. Me, I got...
I got nothin'.
- You're creepin' me out.
- lt's just self-preservation.
I'm beginning to realise that I'm not gonna solve this, and that one of your typically insane ideas is probably gonna be our best chance.
- How much time until detonation? - You were right.
We cut it in half.
25 hours.
- What now?
- Well, first I thought I'd get dressed.
Right.
Leave.
Right.
Do you want me to hold anything, or...?
This weapon is unlike any Goa'uld design I have seen.
I have seen similar construction. lt seems to have been built by the Ancients.
Who are they?
An advanced race of beings who created the Stargates.
- But I thought...
- The Goa'uld steal their technology.
If this is not Goa'uld technology and Anubis has merely learned to operate it... Perhaps he will not be able to rebuild it quickly.
- But do we have sufficient explosive?
- That is our concern. You remain here.
- But I...
- You are injured.
You will slow our pace and risk giving us away.
- My symbiote heals me. I can go.
- Rya'c, listen to him.
This is but one of many battles to be fought.
Remain here until sundown.
We will try to return before then.
If we encase the gate, it could reduce the effects of the explosion by 40 per cent.
There isn't time to implement that plan.
If we detonate the gate ourselves now, we could reduce the damage by 20 per cent.
The damage to the atmosphere would be irreversible.
Any survivors would be stuck on a world incapable of sustaining life.
So far, we've been unsuccessful in our attempts to reduce...
- What you thinkin'?
- Besides the fact that they are morons?
What do you think the little alien guy's doing down there?
- Bet you regret coming here now.
- Can't really look at it that way, can we?
So... what are you doin'?
It's the stupidest thing, but it's been bugging me.
- What's that?
- We're inside a mountain.
The gate can't fit through any of these doors.
- So how did we get it in here?
- Yeah. The ceiling retracts.
Above it is a shaft that leads to the surface, and inside is a crane mechanism that hoisted the gate down.
- Interesting. - Yeah.
- Does it go up?
- Moving the gate won't shut it off.
I mean, there is nowhere on Earth that... I knew you'd think of something.
The shield most likely extends around the perimeter of the weapon.
The path.
(Carter) Just hear me out. All we need to do is get it far enough away from Earth.
The X-302 can achieve that without having to enter hyperspace.
- That's crazy.
- We have less than 24 hours.
Two to get the gate to the surface, four to get it to Peterson and loaded onto a C-1 7, and two more to fly it to area 51 .
The 7 47 meets us in Nevada, which leaves us 16 hours to get the rig mounted and airborne.
And none of this is gonna happen if we're just standing around.
I think that this is gonna save the planet, and we are gonna do it.
Move, people.
- Well done, Major.
- lt wasn't all my idea, sir.
- And I dare say it's not done yet.
- Right. Sir. You do realise that if this works we won't have a Stargate any more.
It did occur to me.
Drop your weapons!
Yeah, this is Sergeant Siler.
We're ready.
Activate the crane.
I have been instructed by my superiors to offer you the following compromise.
In exchange for your continued cooperation and full disclosure of the X-302 technology, we are willing to facilitate the use of our Stargate.
Facilitate?
A financial arrangement to be negotiated.
- You want us to rent it?
- A simplistic way of putting it.
The X-302's hyperspace technology doesn't work.
It will someday.
The reason I am here in the first place is because my government is unwilling to incur the expense and risk of running a Stargate programme.
- We are simply trying...
- Here's the part you don't understand.
Even if - and I stress if - we're able to successfully dispose of this gate, there's nothing to stop Anubis starting all this over again with a second gate.
No one's going to be running a Stargate programme.
The second gate has to stay buried.
What did you hope to accomplish here?
You thought you could destroy something created by a god as powerful as Anubis?
He did not create the weapon and he is not a god.
Your god may have been weak, shol'va.
Mine is not.
If you know of me, then you know of our cause.
The Jaffa rebellion grows strong.
All Goa'uld are false gods, and their only real power comes from the Jaffa whom they oppress.
The next time you open your mouth to speak, it will be to answer my questions.
You did not kill all the Jaffa at the rings.
We know there are three of you.
Where's the boy?
Evidence of how desperate your pathetic little rebellion is.
You bring a boy to fight the war of men.
Or is it something else?
Maybe he's someone to whom you wish to prove yourself.
Bring me the old man.
Wherever the boy is, he will not escape.
Unlike you, he's of little value to Anubis.
However, on your behalf, I'll be happy to demonstrate to him how a real warrior fights... to the death.
is there anything else I should know?
There's some concern that the 302s may not have the fuel capacity to exit the atmosphere carrying the Stargate.
- How is that possible?
- The engines were designed for a craft with an alien inertial dampening system that reduced its overall mass.
Yes. And?
- You'll be carrying a very heavy load.
- How heavy? - The gate weighs 64,000lbs, sir.
- That's heavy.
You'll need to reach an altitude exceeding 180km.
At minimum escape velocity before I release the gate, or it'll fall back to Earth.
Based on the X-302's rocket-fuel capacity, even a full burn won't do it, so the other engines have to get you partway, hauling something six times greater than they were made to.
Carter... - The whole rig isn't exactly aerodynamic. Carter!
I'm not so sure I want to know any of this.
They're lightening the 302, but that's why you're going alone.
Believe it or not, every pound counts.
Shouldn't have had that cake.
Wish I could go with you, sir.
Yes, I'm sure you do.
And I find that quite bizarre.
- Anything else?
- lf this works, Jonas really deserves...
What? - Deserves what?
- l don't know. Something.
He's the one who gave me the idea to do this.
Sir, he gave up everything to bring us the naquadria.
The hyperspace generator doesn't work.
That's not his fault.
Good luck, sir.
Hey, what could go wrong, huh?
(Jaffa) The prisoners will not speak.
(leader) Take them to the rings and have them transported up to the Ha'tak.
What exactly did you remove?
Weapons, some of the life-support.
There's still more than a day's worth.
Well, if we need more than an hour, we're all in trouble.
We also took out radar, some of the safety mechanisms, landing gear...
Excuse me?
We had to accommodate the clamping system.
Once you re-enter the atmosphere, you'll have to eject.
After you target the 302 to splash down off the coast of Florida.
- When were you gonna tell me this?
- Just now. We weren't sure any of this would happen until five minutes ago.
You're not gonna believe this.
Holy crap.
They're waiting for you.
Good luck.
They're airborne, sir.
(pilot) Mission Command, we're approaching separation altitude.
(pilot) Colonel, confirming altitude at 10,000m.
Roger that.
This is Mission Command. You have a go for separation.
Proceeding with separation.
Separation complete.
(pilot) Good luck, sir.
Stop saying that.
Altitude reaching 30km.
(O'Neill) Velocity at Mach 6.
Engaging aerospike engines.
It's gettin' a little bumpy, Command.
Roger that, Starflight.
You're still too shallow to fire the rocket booster.
I may have been understating things.
It feels like this thing's falling apart.
Altitude is 42km. He needs to reach 50 before he can fire the main rocket engine.
Command, I've got a master caution alarm.
Roger that, Starflight.
Losing power.
Starflight, your altitude is only 48km.
(O'Neill) Full port engine failure.
Starboard at six zero per cent.
Preparing to ignite rocket booster.
You're still too low, Starflight.
(O'Neill) I'm losing velocity, Command.
I'm going to start losing altitude.
Command, please advise.
OK, Starflight, go with main-engine burn.
Roger.
Velocity is 25,000km per hour.
28. He's gotta reach 40 and sustain it for at least 15 seconds now.
Main-engine burn at one zero zero per cent.
Velocity approaching 40,000km per hour.
Altitude one two zero kilometres.
Five, six, seven... (O'Neill) Preparing to release the gate.
- Not yet, Starflight.
- l'm burning out here.
All right. That's it. I'm out of gas.
(powering-down noise) Starflight, your altitude is 130km.
He's not gonna make it. He's slowing.
He had to fire the rocket booster too early.
- lt didn't work?
- He's gonna fall back to Earth, sir.
OK. Got any ideas?
Anybody wanna wish me luck?
(Command) We're working on it.
Based on altitude, angle of ascent and velocity, he'll hit Europe in 35 minutes.
If he puts the 302 in a nose dive, he could cut his descent time in half.
- Why?
- He can drop the gate in the Atlantic.
I'm figuring there's time for it to sink maybe 2,000, 3,000ft.
- Will that do any good?
- lt'll reduce the devastation.
- By how much?
- Not much, sir.
Enough that it's worth a shot, isn't it?
Rya'c.
(Command) We can reduce the damage by dropping the gate into the ocean.
You have to put the X-302 into a nose dive, and...
- What?
- Starflight, it's all we got.
- What about the hyperdrive?
- Colonel, it didn't work.
We just don't know where it'll send me, right?
(O'Neill) Who cares as long as it's a galaxy far, far away?
He's right. The window formed, it was just unstable.
We have no idea what would happen if we opened a window within the atmosphere.
Yeah, well, given the situation...
(Command) We're taking it under advisement.
Please stand by.
- Major, I can make a call.
- Do it, sir.
You really are a lunatic. I said you were an artist, but I haven't slept in three days.
You're creating an interdimensional field around an already highly-charged Stargate with an unstable burst of energy.
- l realise...
- What I am suggesting has real benefits.
Maybe it saves a few lives.
If this works, we save the entire planet.
- What chance do we have of that?
- Maybe we can reduce the risk a little.
- (both) How?
- The instability of the naquadria... ls relative to the size of the burst you're trying to extract.
We don't have to send the gate across the galaxy.
Even a second in hyperspace potentially gets us millions of miles.
Make the call.
This is General Hammond. I need to speak with the president immediately.
Altitude seven six kilometres... and still falling.
OK, we have orders, Starflight.
We're gonna try it your way.
Thank you.
Run me through it.
(Carter) We have to override the safety protocol that will cause the 302 to avoid an unstable wormhole.
We think we can increase the chance of this working by only activating the generator for one second.
It wasn't programmed to work for such a short time.
Hang on.
Of course.
Thank you.
Sir, we're gonna write a new subroutine. It'll be ready to upload in a few minutes.
All right, well, in the meantime, I'll just... keep falling.
Carter. We're done. Uploading the new program.
All you'll have to do is activate the generator.
- Roger that.
- Sir, if this works... I know.
- l know.
- Sir?
- What?
/ Good luck.
Activating hyperspace generator.
Now.
This is Observer One.
Visual confirmation.
The X-302 has entered the hyperspace window.
Colonel?
Colonel, do you read?
This is Observer One.
There is no sign of a chute.
There is, however, a light show going on up here.
It worked.
Deep Space is estimating that the gate detonated three million miles from Earth.
This is Observer Two. I have a visual on a chute.
Moving in for confirmation.
Mission Command, the cockpit module is intact.
We are pinpointing splashdown position.
Patching in satellite imagery.
(Command) Observer Two, pararescue team is on the way.
(pilot) Roger that.
Colonel O'Neill is conscious and waving.
- The gate has shut down.
- Let us hope it is not too late. Look.
So that's it? You're just givin' up, closing' the shop?
At least until we find a way to defend ourselves against this kind of thing.
- Shouldn't take you long.
- Yeah, right. I thought you'd be happy.
Hey, I never said we shouldn't use the Stargate.
- Let me know if I can help.
- l will. Thanks.
- That means you don't hate me.
- Maybe. Too bad for you.
Why?
I was more attracted to you when I did.
Really?
- Colonel. I'm glad you're OK.
- Thank you, sir.
You know the president wants to see you in person? - Yes.
We spoke on my way here.
- You can have any assignment you want.
Actually, I've always wanted to command my own boat.
- The navy?
- No, somethin' a little smaller, with oars.
You deserve it, Jack.
- You sure you wanna take this?
- We're closed for business.
I was supposed to retire five years ago.
We don't know when we can re-establish the Stargate programme, if ever.
Actually, I just meant it says "Property of US Air Force" on it.
I still feel responsible for the teams stranded offworld, but there is nothing... (phone rings)
Hammond. We're receiving a communication.
What's up?
Go ahead.
They're all here.
(Teal'c) General Hammond.
Teal'c! O'Neill. lt's good to hear you are well.
The weapon used by Anubis is destroyed.
- We feared it was too late for the Tauri.
- lt was close there for a minute.
We approach in a cargo ship. Request permission to land.
- NORAD's aware of their approach.
- Permission granted.
Welcome back.
Good job.
It is in fact Rya'c who deserves the honour.
Sir, if you don't mind me asking, what exactly did we give the Russians?
- Good old American dollars, Major.
- You're kidding.
And the plans for the X-302 and 303.
Really?
And one more thing.
- So, I hear you're a pretty good pilot.
- Master Bra'tac taught me well.
I hope to be as good as my father one day.
Just know that no one is that good.
It also helps to be lucky.
Don't I know that.
Listen, you sure you don't wanna stick around for a while, kinda hang out?
Rya'c has chosen to help Bra'tac spread the word of our cause.
Well, it's good to see you again.
Colonel. Colonel, you got a moment?
Carter told me everything you did to help out.
We all appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.
See you later.
Colonel, Dr Jackson is gone.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Not a day goes by when I don't think about what happened.
I stood by and watched while he saved my people from disaster.
I should have jumped through the glass, disarmed the device.
He's gone because I didn't.
You have to live with that. So do I.
You want me to make you feel better?
It wasn't your fault. I don't blame you.
If I could go back and change what happened, I would do that, but I can't.
All I can do is try and change what happens from now on.
I don't want you to exonerate me, I just want to be given the opportunity to prove that I can make a difference.
You wanted to see me, sir?
This is not what you want to hear, but part of the deal to get the Russian Stargate involved agreeing to let one of their officers join SG-1 .
This is the thanks I get for saving the world again?
I'm sorry, Jack. You're going to have to live with this.
Sir, can't we just give 'em their own unit?
They'd be happy with that, wouldn't they?
What about SG-1?
Actually, General, I've already chosen our new team member.
Good luck, Colonel.
Thank you, sir.
- How do I look?
- You might wanna lose the helmet.
- Good guess on the green.
- Thanks.
SG-1 , you have a go.
Thank you, sir.

Previously on Stargate SG-1:
- Whom do you serve?
- Anubis.
He is dead!
That was what you assumed after you attempted to murder him.
His hand was exposed to the equivalent of eight to nine grays of neutron radiation.
It's a lethal dose, sir.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
Yeah.
You too.
The ship is Asgard.
We are being hailed.
I am Thor, supreme commander of the Asgard fleet.
Your presence here is a violation of the Protected Planets Treaty, and you must withdraw immediately.
I don't think so.
If you do not comply, I will be forced to open fire.
Yes, I suppose you will.
You will be destroyed.
I am the great god Osiris, and gods cannot be destroyed.
- You should know that.
- Very well.
Enemy ship is powering weapons.
Shields are holding.
The ship remains undamaged.
Our days of bowing to the Asgard are finally over.
Major.
Sir.
I just wanted to inform you that Colonel O'Neill requests that SG-1 remain on active duty while we try to find a replacement for Dr Jackson.
What are we supposed to do? Keep working like nothing happened?
I understand how you feel.
With all due respect, sir, I don't even understand how I feel.
We didn't even have a memorial service.
- We're not even really sure he's dead.
- And that's the problem.
What are we supposed to do, sir?
Wait and hope that he comes back, or... or just move on?
When I was in Vietnam, I saw my best friend shot down.
I know he survived.
I saw his chute open, radioed his position.
But I never found out what happened to him.
His body was never recovered.
The Vietnamese never admitted they took him prisoner.
For years I kept thinking that someday he's just going to walk through the door.
So what did you do?
I learned to live with it.
Unauthorised offworld activation.
- What the hell's going on?
- Main power's down.
Phones are down.
General Hammond to the gate room. General Hammond to the gate room.
Let's get up there.
Stand down.
- Freyr.
- Major Carter, General Hammond.
I apologise for our absence of late, but our war with the replicators has reached a critical stage.
- We might be able to help you with that.
- Yes, we received your message.
If, as you say, this android was responsible for creating the first generation of replicators, it may well prove invaluable.
However, that is not the only reason I have come.
There has been an incident with the Goa'uld.
An incident?
Commander Thor has been killed.
- Killed?
How?
- The Goa'uld attacked a protected planet and Commander Thor was dispatched with the only ship available.
We expected the Goa'uld to retreat once our presence was felt, but they did not.
The Asgard ship was destroyed in the ensuing battle.
Is not Asgard military technology far superior to that of the Goa'uld?
Their new shields are more advanced than we believed, and it appears they have upgraded their weapons as well.
We can no longer be confident of victory when facing superior numbers.
So, in other words, the protected planets are no longer protected.
- Including Earth.
- Our ability to enforce the treaty will depend greatly on the outcome of our battle with the replicators.
However, in the meantime, we do have another problem.
An Asgard scientist is stranded in the research facility beneath the surface of the planet in question.
We would like you to mount a rescue mission.
Why us?
We have no ships available.
We understand you have a Goa'uld cargo ship at your disposal.
Well, it isn't exactly in perfect working order.
We managed to repair it, but...
We'll do it.
It's what we do, isn't it?
The research being conducted on this planet is vital to the future of the Asgard.
We would be for ever in your debt.
Colonel.
We need to talk.
I don't wanna hear it, Carter.
- You can't pretend this didn't happen.
- I'm not pretending anything.
This is the job.
We lose people all the time.
We're talking about Daniel.
What do you want me to do?
He's gone. We've got work to do.
Are you not all right, Major Carter?
I'm fine.
You continue to mourn the loss of Daniel Jackson.
Yeah, I do. Tell me I'm not the only one.
I will perform the proper rituals when the opportunity presents itself.
Until that time, this mission must take priority.
Please, Teal'c.
I get enough of that "way of the warrior" crap from Colonel O'Neill.
Daniel Jackson has ascended to a higher plane of existence.
Many Jaffa dedicate their lives to achieving such a goal.
So I'm supposed to celebrate?
It is a great accomplishment.
We were a team, Teal'c.
No one can even begin to understand what we went through together, what we mean to each other.
So maybe Daniel has achieved something of great cosmic significance.
I don't know.
And to be honest with you, right now I don't really care.
I'd rather have him back.
As would I.
We are approaching the Adara system.
Two motherships orbit the second planet.
We can't activate the cloak until we're out of hyperspace.
For a brief interval they could detect us.
- How brief?
- A few seconds.
The odds of them spotting us are slim.
- How slim?
- Hardly worth mentioning.
And yet... you did mention it.
Yeah. I'm beginning to wish I hadn't.
Well, at least they're not shooting at us.
That's good.
We are approaching the upper atmosphere.
- It's pretty thick.
- There is considerable turbulence.
You know, we should consider putting another chair back here.
When you think about it, it'd be much safer, wouldn't it?
We have arrived at the coordinates given to us by Freyr.
- Nice view.
- This can't be right.
The atmosphere is over 80%% % carbon dioxide and the surface temperature is 420° Fahrenheit.
Hot.
Yeah.
How are we to locate the Asgard facility?
Well, that was easy.
Ah, humans.
Interesting.
Greetings.
I am Heimdall.
I assume you were sent by the Asgard High Council.
Not exactly.
Uh, Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Carter and Teal'c.
I have heard much of your exploits on behalf of the Asgard.
Dr Jackson is not with you?
Uh, no.
In any case, it is a great pleasure to meet you.
Where are we exactly?
Several hundred metres beneath the surface.
Of course.
We'd have to be - the surface is uninhabitable.
The Goa'uld are unaware of your presence?
I am monitoring their communications.
They know the laboratory exists, but they have been unable to pinpoint its location.
Well, why don't we get out of here before they find out?
I'm afraid we cannot leave.
- Why not?
- First we must rescue Thor.
I thought Thor was dead.
He is not.
However, his life is in grave danger.
He is a prisoner of the Goa'uld.
Commander Thor.
I apologise for the accommodations, but we weren't expecting company.
You have committed an act of war against the Asgard.
The response will be swift and decisive.
As swift and decisive as your attempt to defend this planet?
After Thor's ship was destroyed, the Goa'uld detected an escape pod.
They retrieved it before it could disappear into the atmosphere.
How do you know Thor is alive?
I am able to scan the interior of the Goa'uld mothership.
I have located Thor's biosignature here.
Why not just beam him out?
My sensors can penetrate their shields, but my transportation device cannot.
Can you detect Goa'uld life signs as well?
I can.
- Thor is not alone.
- The red dot indicates a symbiote.
So it's a Goa'uld or a Jaffa.
In all probability, Thor is being tortured for information about Asgard technology.
With that knowledge, the Goa'uld could easily come through our Stargate.
There wouldn't be anything we could do about it.
I underestimated your strength.
That mistake will not be made again.
Perhaps not.
But next time we'll have an even greater advantage.
We'll have learned all your secrets.
I will never surrender my knowledge to you.
Not to me, no.
Anubis himself has taken an interest in this matter.
He's on his way here as we speak.
The Goa'uld is leaving.
Can you communicate with him?
Yes, I can.
Thor?
Thor?
Buddy?
- Hey. How you doin'?
- O'Neill. I am surprised to see you.
Yeah. We're down on the planet with...
- Heimdall.
- Yeah, him.
Working on a way of getting you out of here.
That would be unwise.
You must take Heimdall and his research materials and leave immediately.
What, are you nuts?
We're not gonna leave you behind.
More Goa'uld are coming.
I have been informed that Anubis will conduct my interrogation.
All the more reason to get you out.
I will resist their attempts to probe my mind.
I will die before I give them any information.
But the very survival of the Asgard depends on Heimdall's discoveries.
Sir, you've got company.
We're gonna have to pull you out.
All right, listen.
I gotta go. But I'll be back.
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's fine for now.
Except for the fact that he wants us to leave him behind.
- For what reason?
- I wouldn't mind knowing that myself.
Thor is concerned that if we delay, the materials in this laboratory will fall into the hands of the Goa'uld.
What exactly are you studying?
I am researching the genetic history of the Asgard.
Yeah, now see, that doesn't sound like something worth dying for.
That is because you do not understand the gravity of the situation.
Feel free to enlighten us.
As a race, the Asgard reproduce exclusively through a process of enhanced cellular mitosis.
Are you serious? You have no other means of propagation?
No.
- Carter?
- They're clones, sir.
All of them.
Well, that answers a few questions.
In fact, for nearly a thousand years we have been physically incapable of achieving cell division through meiosis.
Sexual reproduction, sir.
A thousand years?
It is not something we usually discuss with other races.
This I understand.
Through cloning, we have achieved a measure of immortality.
As each Asgard's body fails, his consciousness is transferred into a newer, younger version of himself.
Unfortunately, the lack of genetic diversity has become a problem.
It's like making a copy of a copy of a copy.
Eventually there's deterioration.
We created a process of controlled mutation, which has helped us to avoid complete genetic breakdown.
But we are at the limits of our technical capabilities.
The truth is, the Asgard are a dying race.
- Have you located the Asgard facility?
- Not yet, my lord.
We waste time.
Lord Yu is mounting an offensive.
Our ships are needed elsewhere.
The planet's atmosphere generates much electromagnetic interference.
Then send a squadron of gliders.
At low altitude their sensors will be more effective.
The atmosphere is too thick.
It'd be extremely dangerous for the pilots.
And how dangerous will it be when Lord Anubis arrives and you have nothing to offer but excuses?
I will dispatch the squadron myself.
Very wise.
If Anubis is gonna interrogate Thor, he'll have to ring aboard the ship.
Once they lower the shields, we can beam Thor out.
The shields will not be lowered.
They will merely adjust the frequency to accept a ring transmission.
Then we beam up from the cargo ship at the same time.
Once Anubis is on board, the frequency will be readjusted and we will be trapped.
So we take out the shields from the inside. There.
The shield- generator room is located here.
You can use explosives to disable it and I will transport everyone out.
Once the rings are activated, the Goa'uld will be aware of us.
One of us stays here and uses the Asgard scanner to direct the others away from any guards or patrols.
First I must complete my preparations for departure.
OK.
Carter, you stay here.
Teal'c and I will go up.
I must remind you that time is of the essence.
This laboratory will not remain undetected indefinitely.
Right.
Lord Anubis has arrived.
Sir, we found a ring room that's clear.
Stand by.
Roger that.
- Ring room has been activated.
- Now, sir.
Monitoring your progress, sir.
Unauthorised transport onto the ship.
Intruders?
The signal appears to have come from the planet.
I am unable to determine the specific coordinates.
Organise a security detail.
Maximum containment.
I want them found.
Proceed to the end of the corridor and take a right.
Hold up, sir.
There's a large party headed your way.
Which way?
Should we double back, what?
No, sir. There's a corridor ahead on your left.
You can duck in there.
They're almost there.
Sir, we've got a problem.
There are several Jaffa patrols bearing down on your position.
- Where? What direction?
- From all directions, sir.
Stand by.
There's no way out.
Perhaps a diversionary tactic would be in order.
Carter?
Damn it.
Hey, guys!
What's happening?
Nice.
- Heimdall says the way ahead is clear.
- Let's move out.
You are the one they call Thor.
I am Anubis.
As I have told your lieutenant, I will reveal nothing to you.
This device... will be implanted into your brain.
It will form a link between your mind and the ship's computer.
Your knowledge will simply be downloaded into our memory banks.
You will no doubt resist.
And you will no doubt fail.
The Goa'uld possess no such technology.
I think you will find many things have changed since my return.
The intruders have breached our perimeter.
How?
One of our patrols was ambushed.
Seal the lower decks and divert coolant from the hyperdrive into the ventilation system.
- The gas is toxic.
- Only with prolonged exposure.
- Shall I evacuate the engine room?
- The intruders may be monitoring us.
- We cannot give them a warning.
- But the engines will overheat.
The entire compartment will be flooded with radiation.
- Many Jaffa will die.
- And be greatly honoured in the afterlife.
Carter?
This is it, sir.
The shield- generator room is on the other side of that door.
- There are six Jaffa inside.
- Only six?
Colonel!
Teal'c!
Colonel!
- Are you sure they're not injured?
- Their signals remain strong.
They appear to have been taken to some kind of holding cell.
- Well, we've gotta get them out of there.
- I'm not sure yet.
- In the meantime, we must do all we can to keep the materials in this laboratory from falling into Goa'uld hands.
What exactly are we talking about here?
Some DNA samples?
Not exactly.
- What is it?
- That is one of my ancestors.
30, 000 years ago, a ship was launched from the Asgard home world, its crew placed in suspended animation.
There was a failure in the navigational system and the ship was lost.
It drifted across the empty expanse between our galaxies until it arrived here.
- We discovered it six months ago.
- And this is one of its original crew?
The only one that was perfectly preserved.
He is from a time before our genetic manipulation became irreversible.
So that's why he's so important.
You hope his physiology can give you clues to stave off genetic degradation.
We kept the laboratory in this galaxy to avoid the threat of the replicators.
Now we can no longer afford to wait.
It is only a matter of time before the Goa'uld pinpoint our location.
I will require your assistance to adapt the stasis pod to the ship's power supply.
All right.
But when we're done I want you to beam me back to the lab.
I'm not ready to give up on Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c just yet.
I can't believe they took my watch.
Major Carter will soon have no choice but to leave with Heimdall.
If she's smart, she's already gone.
In which case our chances of escape are negligible.
Oh, I don't know.
All we gotta do is bust out of here, take out every Jaffa between here and the peltak, commandeer the ship and fly on home.
I stand corrected.
O'Neill?
Thor?
Is that you?
- Where are you?
- I am still in my cell.
However, my mind has been linked with the ship's computer.
I am using the internal communication system to synthesise my voice.
OK.
The Goa'uld are attempting to download information from my prefrontal cortex.
It is only a matter of time before they break through my mental defences.
Well, you know, love to help you, but we've got our own problems here.
I am aware of your situation.
I may be able to rewrite some minor subroutines in the security protocol.
To what end?
Sweet.
I am growing weak.
Further communication will be impossible.
Hang tight.
We'll get you out.
Colonel.
- Still with us, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Heimdall's got the cargo ship prepped and ready to go.
He can beam us straight there, but we still need you to get those shields offline.
Yeah, well, they took our C4, so we won't be blowing any stuff up.
We have to find a control relay and pull the crystals.
It'll only buy us a few seconds, but that should be all we need.
Right.
Which way?
I'll have to step off the holopad to check.
Try to stay out of sight.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Report.
The battle with Lord Yu does not go well.
We request reinforcements.
That stubborn old man simply refuses to die.
Dispatch the other ships.
Lord Osiris, one of our gliders has detected an energy signature beneath the planet's surface.
Do we have specific coordinates?
We do.
But there is no way in.
Then we'll just have to make our own way, won't we?
What's your situation?
We're working on another way to get the shields offline.
- What was that?
- I think the Goa'uld made my position.
You should leave immediately.
Just a few more minutes.
Come on, Carter.
I've got it, sir.
Go down this corridor and up two levels.
I'll meet you there.
OK.
Carter.
There should be an access panel somewhere along here.
OK, next time I'm the hologram.
- OK, we just have to pick the right crystal.
- Which one?
Carter?
I thought I heard something.
There's someone in here.
- Major Carter.
- Osiris.
We have Colonel O'Neill and the shol'va, so that just leaves...
- Where is he?
- Forget it.
Perhaps we should take them all.
Here's a thought.
Shields are down.
Controls are offline.
Repair them.
Once more.
Where is Dr Jackson?
He's dead.
You're lying.
Go to hell.
Get us out of here.
Well done, O'Neill.
Thanks.
Thor?
Buddy?
O'Neill.
You cannot take me with you.
Why not?
The link between myself and the Goa'uld ship has not been severed.
They will be able to track our position.
You must leave me behind.
All right, that doesn't work for me.
It's not an option. OK?
Lord Anubis, the Asgard prisoner is gone.
He will not get far.
We've cleared the atmosphere.
Bring up the hyperdrive.
Hyperdrive is offline.
Cloak is failing.
Cloak is down.
We have lost our shields.
We cannot sustain another hit.
Sir, we're receiving a transmission.
Your ship is defenceless.
You cannot escape.
Surrender now.
- Any ideas?
- We cannot risk capture.
We must destroy the ship ourselves.
Any good ideas?
We've got company.
Three Asgard ships.
Sir, I'm picking up a transmission to the Goa'uld ship.
This is Freyr of the Asgard.
The vessels you face are far superior to the one you attacked.
Challenge us at your own peril.
Mothership's retreating.
It's over.
That's it?
Their examination of the android must've yielded results - it looks like the Asgard have the upper hand against the replicators.
What about Thor?
They managed to remove the device from his brain, but it may be too late.
Apparently he's lapsed into a coma.
If they knew more about the device they might be able to help him.
They're studying it now towards that end.
Unfortunately, it's unlike anything they've ever encountered.
Anubis clearly has access to technology previously unknown to the Goa'uld.
- It would explain his rapid rise to power.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
You're dismissed.
We're not that much of a nuisance just yet.
Of that I am not so sure.
Hey. Heading home?
Actually, we were thinking of stopping off for a bite to eat.
Interested?
- Sounds good.
- General?
You three go ahead.
I've still got some work to do.
What was that?
Perhaps a malfunction in the ventilation system.
Yeah, that's probably it.
Bye, sir.
Have a good night.
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":
Run!
A requisition just came to me for a C-5 to make a classified pick-up at an NID site.
(man) We demand you return the Touchstone!
It's missing?
They were dressed like you and carried weapons.
Colonel O'Neill.
Is this a joke, Maybourne?
I think you'll wanna hear what I have to offer you.
Your mission?
Use any means necessary to acquire technology to help Earth in the battle against the Goa'uld or other unforeseen aggressors.
(woman) There's an Asgard ship over the base!
I'll be holdin' the door open so you can't go anywhere else.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce that you are all under arrest for high crimes against the United States and its allies.
- How overdue is SG-9?
- Coming up on 11 hours, sir.
That's not like Major Benton.
Dial P2A-018.
Try to establish radio contact from our end.
Sir, my mission report.
Better late than never, I always say.
(technician) Chevron one encoded.
Yep. I always say that.
- Chevron two encoded.
- What's goin' on?
SG-9 was on an extended mission to re-establish diplomatic relations with P2A-018.
018...
- Latona. - Oh, yes.
One of several planets visited by the NID while running their offworld programme.
Right.
Major Benton has spent several months negotiating access to a defensive weapon they call the Sentinel.
It's said to be capable of defending their entire planet.
Yeah, I... read the report.
They were scheduled to return early this morning.
Chevron seven locked.
Standing by, sir. MALP relay is active.
This is Hammond.
SG-9, report.
Major Benton, you are overdue. Please respond.
General, sir, this is Sergeant Grogan.
Major Benton... (static) ...three days... - (static) The Star...
The Latonans tried to... but the thing didn't work.
- Can you make it back to the Stargate?
- Negative. There are two Jaffa... ...supported by a staff... - (static)
There's no way I can get back to the Stargate.
- Sergeant, shut it down.
- Yes, sir.
(man) OK, Marul. Go ahead.
Your friends will see me?
(man) Not right now.
I'll send your greeting back with my report.
- What shall I say?
- Anything you like.
(man chuckles) How about "hello"?
The rat bastard.
- I thought he came across as very nice. - The voice behind the camera.
Colonel Sean Grieves, formerly of the NID.
He led an offworld team for Colonel Maybourne and was one of the members of that organisation convicted of high treason.
And what was Grieves' team trying to steal?
The Latonans possess a planetary defence they call the Sentinel, which has kept them safe from the Goa'uld for generations.
I can see why the NID would wanna get their hands on it.
We put 'em all away before they could.
Frankly, I'm afraid Colonel Grieves' team may have done something to the Sentinel they haven't admitted to.
- Fiddlin' around with it, was he?
- Well, according to his report, the Latonans never granted Grieves' team access to the Sentinel, before they were... recalled and arrested.
You don't think it's possible for an NID operative to lie?
I believe it is, Daniel Jackson.
Right.
So if Grieves' team disabled the Latonans only means of self-defence...
- We're responsible. - Grieves is responsible, thank you.
I doubt the Latonans will appreciate that distinction, Colonel.
Time will be of the essence.
The Goa'uld forces SG-9 encountered on Latona were most likely sent as a test.
- To see if the Sentinel was operational.
- And by now they'll have reported back.
A Goa'uld mothership most likely is not far off, if the Goa'uld believe that Latona may be conquered.
Might be a good time to try that new guidance system on the UAV.
I think that can be arranged.
Sir, before we go anywhere, we need to talk to Grieves. - Why?
- Well, whether we like it or not, sir,
Colonel Grieves and Lieutenant Kershaw may be the only people qualified to fix it.
I'll go.
You're dismissed.
He's worried I might try to kill you.
In that case, I insist.
Had many visitors lately?
Did Maybourne stop by, see how the old team's doing?
- What do you want, O'Neill?
- P2A-018.
- A device called the Sentinel. - What about it?
I need to know what you did to screw it up and how I can fix it.
I'm more inclined to tell you where to shove it.
As we speak, SG-9 is either pinned down by the Goa'uld or dead, so let's just cut the crap, OK?
- How is this my problem?
- You're responsible.
018 is defenceless because of you.
Earth is defenceless because of you.
You don't mind that.
You stole technology from our allies.
If I hadn't shut you down, they would have.
Do you really think the Asgard or the Tok'ra will rush to our defence when the Goa'uld finally decide to stomp on us?
That day is coming, Colonel.
Don't kid yourself.
OK.
I guess I should just go have a chat with Kershaw.
The Latonans didn't want to show us the Sentinel.
We found it ourselves not far from the city.
There was a force field guarding the device itself.
Kershaw and I took two weeks to get in, take it apart, and put it back good as new.
Not good as new.
You did something wrong.
Only thing we did wrong was come back to base to meet our new CO.
It's funny.
At the time I was looking forward to meeting you.
I need you to write down exactly how you got in, and exactly what I need to do to fix this.
If I do anything - anything - I want my sentence commuted.
I think that's understood, goin' in.
And you'll need to take us with you, Kershaw and me.
- SG-1 can handle it.
- Who do you think you are?
We were good, Colonel. Just as good as you.
We were acting for the good of the country.
If you hadn't put me in here, we might have had our own Sentinel by now.
You done?
I don't care how good Carter thinks she is or how cocky you are.
The device is way too complicated for you to try to repair without us.
You already know that, or you wouldn't be here.
UAV is away, sir. Climbing into position.
Receiving telemetry. Confirm two staff cannon emplacements 20m from the gate.
We got lucky, sir.
The cannons couldn't down the UAV before it was out of range.
Begin painting the targets as soon as the UAV reaches altitude.
Close the blast doors. Prepare to launch.
Prepare to launch.
- Target Sierra-1 has been acquired.
- Sergeant, launch when ready.
Missile away.
Sierra-1 destroyed.
Attempting to acquire Sierra-2.
How do you know those are the only emplacements guarding the gate? - We don't.
- Sierra-2 has been acquired by UAV.
Launch when ready.
Sierra-2 has been destroyed, but I can't confirm casualties.
UAV switching to recon mode for stage two.
- That's us.
- Colonel, SG-3 will take point.
Kershaw.
- Major Lawrence, make it a clean sweep.
- Yes, sir.
Why don't you go with 'em? Keep 'em out of trouble.
Be on your six in 60 seconds.
SG-3, let's go, let's go, let's go!
I'll say it again, I don't like goin' into this unarmed.
And... I don't care.
I feel better knowing an archaeologist is watching our backs.
Which end do the bullets go in again?
I'd be happy to show you.
Our mission objective is to fix whatever you screwed up.
If you get any ideas other than that, I'll shoot you.
Understood?
Yeah.
Move out.
No sign of SG-3.
SG-3, this is SG-1 niner.
Report.
Three Jaffa warriors survived the attack.
SG-3 is in pursuit to prevent them from reporting our arrival.
Major Lawrence suggests we continue on.
Colonel?
You want me to take point without a weapon?
I want you to point Teal'c in the right direction.
How many years did you promise to take off their sentence if they fix this?
Actually, they'll get a few more years out of this. - More?
- They were on death row.
How did you find the Sentinel if the Latonans wouldn't show it to you?
(Kershaw) Maybe we're good.
- (O'Neill) Bribed the locals? - (Grieves) You've done your homework.
Major Benton's preliminary report said the Latonans don't use currency of any kind.
(Kershaw) They don't care about material things.
Everybody's got their price.
- Colonel.
- Grogan.
You all right?
There was a Jaffa patrol on my six most of the day.
I decided to stop running and fight it out.
- How long ago?
- Last night.
I guess I passed out and they went right by me.
- They'll be long gone.
- Where's the rest of your team?
Major Benton took a hit in the chest on our way back to the gate.
Tarkman and Winters were with me at first, but I'm the only one left.
Here.
This shouldn't happen, sir. The Latonans have a device...
- We know, Lieutenant.
- We're here to fix it.
Sir, should I tell SG-3 Grogan's coming back to the gate?
Negative, Major.
Teal'c, how soon should we expect a mothership here?
Of that I am unsure, O'Neill.
It could be hours, perhaps even days.
Grogan, can you get me into the city?
There are Jaffa patrols all over the place making sure the Latonans keep their curfew.
But I can take you straight to Marul if you want.
- That's a waste of time. - Why do you say that?
The Sentinel was built centuries ago by Marul's ancestors.
- He has no clue how to use it.
- None of 'em do.
We're here to help these people.
- What the hell do you think you can do?
Maybe give them another option other than being wiped out.
- Grogan, are you good to go?
Good.
- Carter, you're in charge.
- Yes, sir.
- Fix it. - Yes, sir.
Good luck, sir.
Let's go.
(Grogan) That's the main road leading in and out of the city.
You wouldn't happen to know a back way in there, would you?
Yes, sir. I think I do.
- This is it.
- What is?
You have to know it's there. We went right by it at first.
All right, you're on.
Major Carter, it would be wise if we were to guard the entrance.
Absolutely. At least until the force field's down.
- How long will that take?
- Last time it took just over 48 hours.
Maybe Daniel can help you shave a couple of days off that estimate.
You're not preparing for his arrival as I instructed.
Your people ignore the curfew.
- Because they do not understand it.
- It is a simple matter.
Lord Svarog has claimed Latona as part of his domain.
Your conquest will happen, as sure as the sun will rise.
Accept that... and you may live to serve him.
My people have no desire to serve anyone.
When Svarog rains fire from the sky, they will beg for his mercy
- And offer him their devotion. - No, they will not.
They will, when those around them begin to die.
This is my last warning.
Your Lord Svarog should not come.
The Sentinel will send him away. You will all be sent away.
So you have said for three days, yet here I stand.
- The Sentinel is nothing but a legend.
- It is very real.
Then my patrols will find it and destroy it.
- It's all right, Marul.
He's a friend.
- From your world?
That's right.
He's come all the way from Earth just to see you.
I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill.
We need to talk.
Please don't do that.
It doesn't look much like a weapon.
Why don't you make yourself useful, Dr Jackson, and go watch the front door?
I'd rather be helping you, but your approach looks completely random.
The patterns change randomly.
We're trying to keep ahead.
The sounds?
The code to shut off the field is always changing relative to the harmonics between the tones in each pattern.
- How many different patterns are there?
- We've recorded over a hundred. - Oh.
So I should probably...
- Shut up.
Yeah.
Your offer is kind, but not necessary.
I think it is.
The Sentinel has not failed us in centuries.
It will not fail us now.
- What's taking it so long?
- I've sent a messenger to the Sentinel to seek the answer to that question.
Perhaps it is waiting.
You will see.
Our enemy will be sent away.
How, exactly?
One moment they are there, the next they are gone in white light.
- Gone where?
- To the place our ancestors divined.
We are only grateful that our enemies are gone.
And that's it?
Their civilisation has technologically regressed.
Nobody knows how anything works, just so long as it keeps working.
And you've seen this thing working?
Oh, yes. As a child.
An enemy of our people came in a great ship, but it was sent away.
That's the story we get from everybody, sir.
Marul, do you remember a team who came here from Earth two years ago?
Oh, Colonel Grieves, of course.
He asked that he might see the Sentinel to learn its mysteries, so that one day your people might be protected as we are.
But to do that... that would be against our highest law.
No one may see the Sentinel, except its Caretaker.
Yeah, well... They did anyway.
They worked at night so no one would know.
Somehow they got in, they took it apart, put it back together, but something's wrong.
They're trying to fix it, but we might be running out of time.
But... what you say cannot be so.
This flame burns to tell us the Sentinel is watching over us, and in turn is being watched over.
As long as this flame burns, we may rest assured that we are safe from harm.
There's a battalion of Jaffa in your city right now, just waiting to harm you.
- There is a barrier to the chamber.
- They got past it.
- Colonel Grieves gave me his word.
- He lied.
Yet you speak the truth?
He does, Marul.
Teal'c, come in.
A Jaffa patrol.
I count ten, maybe more.
With luck they'll pass right by us.
It is more likely they followed our tracks to this location.
- This is impossible.
- We haven't been at it that long.
- Let me try.
- Do you realise how complicated this is?
It's hit the fan already.
Give me your Beretta.
You think you can help in here? I can help out there.
We have to take all of them out so they can't report back.
A Jaffa patrol must have tracked us here.
We can hold them off for now, but get that force field down.
Do you know what to listen for?
The progression of the harmonic in each pattern relative to its spectral equivalent.
My people have depended on the Sentinel for 300 years.
It was created to be there always, so that we might feel free to pursue matters of the mind and spirit, without fear of what is happening now.
If what you say is true.
I didn't come all this way to lie to you.
- How many will die?
- I don't know.
And I can't undo what's already been done.
But we can save hundreds of your people, maybe all of them.
How?
We're prepared to evacuate as many people as possible.
And military support to get 'em to the gate.
Leave our world...
I'm afraid so.
As we speak, a Goa'uld mothership could be on its way here.
What will I tell them?
That the very people who doomed our world now ask us to trust our lives to them?
(distorted) I am Svarog.
From this day forth, you will serve me.
That's all of 'em I can see.
- What are you doing out here?
- Helpin' you.
- A mothership just fired on the city. - I saw.
You must get that force field down.
That's why you're here.
Jackson wanted a try, I gave him a try.
You were getting shot at, I backed you up.
Or is it you don't like the idea of me with a gun?
It's empty.
Get back in there.
Teal'c, I wanna see what's taking so long.
Keep an eye out.
That voice...
All part of the show.
- The sky rained fire.
- It's from a ship in orbit.
- One with really big speakers. - (door opening)
Marul! Marul!
Has the messenger returned with any news?
There are Jaffa patrols everywhere.
I doubt anybody would make it very far.
Go home. Tee h'eta.
Do you have any other way of defending yourself?
- Carter, come in. - Yes, sir.
The mothership's here.
Some guy named... Svarog.
He's a System Lord, sir. You should get out.
- Yeah.
What's your progress?
- Still working on the force field.
- Major, people are startin' to die here. - Yes, sir.
We're doing our best.
You tell Grieves, if he doesn't fix that thing, I'll shoot him anyway.
Marul, you have to make an announcement.
Tell your people to evacuate the city and head to the Stargate.
Many of your people could survive.
You've got two options: sit here and watch your city burn to the ground, or surrender.
You surrender, they'll enslave your people.
And they'll take some of them as hosts.
The Goa'uld are parasites.
They take over the bodies of people.
My people are innocent.
They have done nothing to deserve this.
I can't stay here much longer.
You've got to make a decision.
But your friends may yet be able to repair the damage they have done.
This Goa'uld is not gonna wait for that.
It's time to go.
With or without you.
Dammit!
You almost had it.
You just had the last two colours in the wrong order.
- We're in!
- Go!
Colonel, we've made it past the force field and we're starting to work on the Sentinel.
Warriors of Svarog approach in greater numbers.
Understood, Teal'c.
We'll make our stand inside the cave.
Keep them at bay as long as you can and then get in.
Daniel, can you get that force field working again?
I'm on it.
Incoming transmission!
- It's SG-3, sir.
- Put it on the speaker.
- This is SG-3 niner.
Come in.
- What's your situation, Major?
Goa'uld forces are headin' toward us.
A battalion supported by gliders.
- Can you hold the Stargate? - Not without reinforcements, sir.
Understood.
What's the status of SG-1?
They're out of radio range, sir.
We've been out of contact for several hours.
Very well, Major. Hold the Stargate for as long as you can, then get out of there.
- SG-1 will just have to get the job done. - Yes, sir.
SG-3 niner out.
- I'm sure they'll find a way, sir.
- It's not SG-1 I'm worried about.
Colonel Grieves?
While stealing a powerful beam weapon from the people of P3Y-294, Colonel Grieves turned the device against his pursuers, killing all three.
We returned the weapon, but P3Y-294 would have nothing further to do with us.
I'll be in my office, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, you and I know that we left this exactly the way we found it.
- We can't have. We missed something. - We didn't.
It must be something else.
Either shut up or go help Jackson get the force field back on.
- (Carter) How many?
- Several gliders, a battalion of warriors.
You wanna be on this side when we get this up again.
Just tell us when.
Go. Save yourselves.
I will remain here as long as this flame burns.
Marul...
As long is it burns, the Caretaker lives.
What Caretaker?
He is not to be spoken of.
It is against our law.
Look, do you want your people to survive or not?
- I'm almost outta ammo!
- OK, get on this side.
- Daniel!
- If you could stop shooting for a second.
I got it. Go, go, go, go.
Kershaw.
It's gonna be all right.
They can't get past the force field.
Colonel.
Carter. Carter, if you can hear me, we've got to find someone called the Caretaker.
He's like a hermit. He lives near the Sentinel and apparently takes care of it.
One of my patrols has discovered your Sentinel.
Even now, warriors of the Tauri endeavour to repair it.
I cannot allow them to succeed.
Tell me how to disable the force field.
That would be against our highest law.
You would sacrifice your own life to defy me?
I would.
Colonel O'Neill, come in.
Force field must be blocking the radio signal.
We put it back the way it was.
- I know we did.
- Obviously we didn't.
If Colonel Grieves can get it working, I'll tell you.
Wait a second.
I think I recognise some of these symbols.
Their written language is similar to the people of P2A-463. - So?
- So it's possible they're related.
Don't tell me you could read that.
No, I'm just saying I recognise some of these symbols.
On P2A-463, these symbols mean "life force", "life energy".
Life energy?
- These ones mean "two as one". - And that means?
I have no idea, but it means something or they wouldn't have written it here.
- The Caretaker, Colonel.
- Shut up!
What if the device is only part of the equation?
- You're guessing.
- We both know nothing's wrong with it.
We put it back the way it was.
What if the Caretaker did more than just look after it?
Tell us of this Caretaker.
The night we found this place, a Latonan man took us by surprise.
- What happened?
- He attacked us.
I defended myself.
Colonel, look out!
My orders were to retrieve technology to save Earth from the Goa'uld at all costs.
- You killed him.
- I defended myself!
We should have taken him into the city.
They could have saved him. I know they could have.
The Caretaker... he begged us to.
Please.
Please. I do not wish to die.
Colonel, maybe we can take him back to the city.
- Yes, the city...
- That's not an option.
But, sir, he'll die if we just leave him here.
We have our orders, Kershaw.
- Then allow me to touch the Sentinel.
- Why?
- Shut him up.
- Please...
Allow me to touch the Sentinel just once with my hand.
- You're not touching anything.
- This is wrong.
It's his own damn fault for sneaking up on me like that.
You've gotta think of the big picture here.
The Sentinel could save Earth.
We're talking about one life-one life - compared to billions of people.
- We don't even know how it works.
- We'll find out.
Will you allow me to give him something for the pain, then, sir?
Fine, but that's all we can do.
When I die,
Marul will know.
What do you mean, he'll know?
He told us that, if he were to die, the Latonans would know anyway.
How so?
A flame in Marul's chamber would die with him.
He... wore a band around his wrist. It was a dead man's switch.
I rigged it so nobody would know he was gone.
Two forces as one, man and machine. No, no!
We missed something.
We just need to find out what it is.
Colonel.
You know, now would be a good time to turn that thing on.
Lower the force field, or your friends will be killed.
- Sir... - Don't do it, Carter.
That's an order.
Jaffa.
- Blow it up! Don't let 'em have it.
- Jaffa.
- Do it! - Yes, sir.
Wait!
I can deactivate the force field.
I can do it from here.
I'm gonna let Colonel Grieves take down the force field, sir.
Carter, I gave you a direct order.
Yes, sir. I understand that.
I think it's the right thing to do.
- He's gone.
- As are the Jaffa.
What just happened?
The Sentinel was never damaged, sir.
It just required a human component.
Man and machine working together to become a weapon.
The Sentinel is indeed a device of great power.
We would be wise to ask the Latonans if we may study it further.
Oh, I think I know what they'd say.
We're receiving a transmission, sir. Audio only.
Let's hear it.
- I'll see if I can clean it up.
- Repeat; this is Commander Hale, chairman of the Kelownan Defence Council, calling Stargate Command. Please respond.
At approximately 0700 this morning, we received a transmission from P2S-4C3.
The man identified himself as Commander Hale, chairman of the Kelownan Defence Council.
When I left, he was undersecretary for military appropriations.
The Kelownan government wants to re-establish trade relations with Earth.
I hope you diplomatically told him where to shove it.
- lt's not that simple, Colonel.
- They tried to frame Daniel.
I don't think it's fair to judge them all by the actions of a few scientists.
The Kelownans are technologically inferior to Earth.
- They have little to offer.
- Except naquadria.
Which doesn't work.
The hyperspace drive on the X-302 didn't work.
That doesn't mean we should give up. Naquadria is still our best bet for creating shields and weapons capable of repelling the Goa'uld.
We need this.
The Kelownan delegation will arrive soon. Yeah.
Is there a problem, Jonas Quinn?
I've just been so caught up in being a member of SG-1 , I kind of forgot how this thing started.
We have taken similar paths.
I too was forced to betray all of that in which I had placed my faith.
I don't know if I can do it, Teal'c.
I mean, they think that I'm a... a traitor.
When I returned to Chulak after leaving the service of Apophis, I too was considered a traitor, shol'va to my friends and family that I'd left behind.
In their eyes, I was dead.
It must have been hard for you to go back.
What I did, I did for my people.
In time they came to understand this.
Well... I don't think my people are ever gonna have a chance to know the truth.
Then you must draw strength in knowing that your cause is just and one day your people will benefit from the sacrifices that you have made.
Welcome to Earth.
I'm General Hammond.
I'm Commander Hale.
This is Ambassador Dreylock and Dr Kieran.
This is Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, Teal'c, and you know Jonas Quinn.
- lt's good to see you, Professor.
- General, we have a lot to discuss.
Right this way.
- Friend of yours?
- He was one of my teachers at university and then he recruited me into the naquadria project.
We've been working together side by side the last six years.
Please, sit down.
I must admit we were surprised to hear from you, given the circumstances of our last encounter.
I'm sure we all regret what happened.
But I don't think anything was done to damage relations irreparably.
You accused a member of my team of sabotage to cover up your incompetence.
And you received stolen goods and are harbouring a traitor.
Perhaps it'd be better if we focused on the matter at hand.
Which is what, exactly?
For several years an uneasy peace has resulted from the rivalry between the three major powers on our planet -
Kelowna, Tirania, and the Andari Federation.
All of that is about to change.
According to our intelligence service, the Tiranians and the Andaris are about to sign a nonaggression pact.
This would leave us in a very vulnerable position.
I'm just curious - what made you think we would care?
We still have something that you want, Colonel.
Naquadria.
In fact, thanks to recent discoveries we have a considerable surplus.
We know that you're decades ahead of us technologically.
In the field of jet propulsion alone, you could give us a significant strategic advantage.
You want military technology?
Without it, Kelowna faces annihilation.
- You are assuming they intend to attack.
- The treaty is an obvious prelude to war.
If we wait for them to make the first move, we won't stand a chance.
See, we've been down this road before.
On a previous mission we encountered a race known as the Eurondans.
They were losing a war. They offered technology in exchange for help.
We then discovered that they were guilty of attempted genocide.
I hardly think this situation compares.
All we want is to protect our people.
I understand, but given our past experience we're reluctant to interfere in the affairs of another planet.
According to Mr Quinn's original report, you regularly interfere in the affairs of a race known as the Goa'uld.
Well, that's a little different.
The Goa'uld enslave millions of people across the galaxy.
If you were to provide us with the means for a quick and decisive victory, you could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives.
If not, we would have no choice but to fall back on our last resort.
Dr Kieran and his team have successfully tested a naquadria bomb.
Its destructive power was beyond all expectations.
If you do not help us, we will have no choice but to use it.
Do you believe the Kelownans are truly facing annihilation?
Just before I left, we did a projection based on this scenario.
We calculated that enemy forces would achieve air superiority within the first five weeks of war.
So if they use the bomb, they have to do it fast.
They're probably considering a pre-emptive first strike.
Really?
I helped research this report. lf they stick with conventional weapons, we are looking at a complete collapse of their entire military within six months.
Can't they negotiate?
I mean, what are they fighting for, anyway?
There's a thousand grievances that go back generations.
The last major conflict was 20 years ago. Nothing was resolved.
But in the past the Tiranians and Andaris hated each other more than Kelownans.
- Apparently they got over it.
- lt's a marriage of convenience. They'll turn on each other, but by then it'll be too late for Kelowna.
Jonas, you're a member of SG-1 now.
Your priorities have changed.
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- The joint chiefs are meeting in an hour.
They're going to want me to give them a recommendation.
We can't do it, sir.
We shouldn't help them defend themselves?
I have nothing against them defending themselves, but... how do we know they'll stop there?
- You sound like Dr Jackson.
- We spent some time together.
I wonder if this doesn't have more to do with your distaste for the Kelownans.
- Possibly, sir.
Unscheduled offworld activation.
- Sergeant?
- We're receiving a signal. - lt's the Kelownans.
- Open the iris.
Dr Kieran.
I apologise for Ambassador Dreylock and Commander Hale.
They were called to an emergency cabinet meeting.
The nonaggression pact was signed an hour ago.
My superiors will meet soon to discuss your situation.
In the meantime, I'd like to speak to Jonas Quinn.
Professor. I didn't know that you were back.
So this is where you're working now.
Yeah, when... when I'm not offworld.
Offworld. You must have seen some incredible things.
- You have no idea.
- Well, you were always a dreamer, Jonas.
But, of course, some of us had to stay behind to deal with reality.
I had to leave.
These people have a much better chance of doing something useful with the naquadria than we ever had.
What good is that to Kelowna?
If they can master shield technology, they'll share that with us.
They won't even share their most basic military hardware.
That's because you come to them as a representative of only one nation.
What the people on our planet need to do is to get over their differences and unite.
Do you really believe that?
Of course.
Then come with me now, and we could make it happen.
What are you talking about?
I couldn't say anything before because the other two are not in the organisation.
The Resistance.
I'm a member of an underground network, Jonas.
We've infiltrated every level of government - even the military.
We intend to stop our leaders before they take us to destruction.
You're talking about a coup.
When the time is right.
But we need your help.
You're telling me that you're part of a secret organisation that is going to seize power from the government.
- Right.
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
On the contrary.
This is our best chance for survival.
There's widespread discontent with the government's hardline war policy.
That's true in Tirania and with the Andari Federation as well.
The people of all three countries are sick of this never-ending conflict, but their leaders have stopped listening to them.
Do you really think you can succeed?
I was at the first test of the naquadria bomb.
I saw the destruction.
I've been having nightmares about it ever since.
We have to succeed.
When will they move against the government?
I don't know, but to prevent war they have to do something fast.
That will not prevent their enemies from attacking.
According to Dr Kieran, there is support for a settlement in all three countries.
They believe if the Resistance seizes Kelowna it will compel the other governments to come back to the table or risk uprisings.
At the least, they'll be too busy dealing with internal discontent to attack.
If they pull it off, we might have a more viable trading partner.
We'd need a lot more intel before we proceed with anything.
The Pentagon has authorised SG-1 to return to the planet and offer Kelowna non-military technology in exchange for naquadria.
- They'll never go for it.
- Maybe not, but we have to try.
In the meantime, contact the Resistance and determine their strength, their numbers, and their chance for success.
- Are you ready to go home?
- I'm not expecting a parade.
Not everyone in Kelowna thinks you're a traitor.
After you left, all of us on the naquadria project began to question what we were doing.
You opened our eyes.
Anyway, it's just temporary.
If I stay a minute after the negotiations are finished I'll be arrested for treason.
That will all change after the Resistance takes power.
All right, let's move out.
Hello again.
I apologise for the delay, but these are difficult times for us.
May I present First Minister Valis?
Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, Major Carter...
And Jonas Quinn.
It's good to see you again, Jonas.
Thank you, sir.
Shall we?
- Have you spoken to your superiors?
- Why, yes, we have.
They send their best.
We've been authorised to continue the trade negotiations.
Excellent.
Before we continue, there's something I'd like to clarify.
Ambassador Dreylock referred to recent discoveries leading to a surplus of naquadria.
Yes.
Our archaeologists have discovered mine shafts beneath the original site.
We've managed to extract and process a considerable amount.
How much?
I thought you'd be interested in the figure, so we converted it to your weight system.
I believe it's something in the area of 300 pounds.
That's an awful lot of dangerous material.
I could look at your storage facilities. I might be able to offer advice.
That won't be necessary.
It's purely a matter of safety.
As Major Carter said, the naquadria is extremely dangerous and we'd hate for some sort of accident to happen.
Mm. Clearly, you have more naquadria than you require.
What precisely are you asking for in return?
We need to start by addressing a serious imbalance in air power.
Our enemies have superior numbers in both strategic bombers and long-range fighter escorts.
Our only hope is to get our jet-interceptor programme off the ground.
We've had technical difficulties with the programme, but we have managed to successfully test a few designs.
We believe that with the help of Major Carter and a team of your engineers, we can have a combat-ready squadron in less than a month.
Well, that's not exactly what we had in mind.
We understand from Jonas that Kelownan medical science currently has little or no defence against bacterial infections.
We're offering a series of drugs known as antibiotics.
We estimate they could save 15,000 lives in the first year alone.
That's a generous offer, Major, and under different circumstances we might accept.
But at the moment we have more pressing needs.
So how are the negotiations coming?
Well, after four hours, the only thing we could agree on was to adjourn for the day.
We're clear, sir.
No bugs. I do not believe they will settle for less than military technology.
They know how much you want the naquadria.
They think that eventually you'll give them what they want.
In the meantime, we need you to take us to this... Resistance.
It's not that simple. I don't get in touch with them, they get in touch with me.
What do you do for them?
I keep them apprised of all the top-level research at the Academy of Science.
Where do you meet them?
They have a base in an old warehouse by the freight yards. lt's heavily guarded.
- Take us there.
- l can't.
I'm not even supposed to go there myself unless I have a scheduled drop.
Professor...
All right, I'll talk to them.
- We weren't expecting you this evening.
- I'm sorry. I needed to talk to you.
This isn't a very good time to be taking risks.
Some members of the government are beginning to question your loyalty.
- They've been watching you.
- l wasn't followed.
Is this about the delegation from Earth?
Yes.
They want to meet with you. How do you know they won't betray us in exchange for naquadria?
I don't think they would do something like that.
You trust them?
I trust Jonas.
First Minister?
Come in.
I wanted a chance to talk to you, Jonas, away from the negotiations.
Please.
It's difficult for me, Jonas, seeing you sitting across the table, acting as the representative of another planet.
It's not easy for me either.
But I made my choices and I'm gonna stick by them.
I'm sure you thought you were doing the right thing.
Oh, I know I did the right thing.
Stargate Command is going to use the naquadria to come up with technologies that may one day save this world from an enemy you can't possibly imagine.
You were one of the most promising young men any of us had ever seen.
Our people had such high hopes for you.
You're not the only one who was disappointed.
I know that you think this is the same old bad blood resurfacing again, just another round of petty violence. But it's not.
This time... this time, Jonas, we face total defeat.
Then get back to the negotiating table.
Give up some land. Do whatever it takes.
You know how much the Tiranians and the Andaris hate each other.
Do you really think that they overcame 200 years of prejudice just to get us to give up a little land?
They mean to destroy us, Jonas.
This is the first step in a fight for world domination, and the naquadria is the only advantage that we have.
And that is where you come in, my friend.
- You're a man of unique talents, Jonas, and, despite what you did, I know that it's not too late for you to serve your country.
I'm offering you a second chance to do that.
If you're asking for information on Earth technology, that's not gonna happen. - l will not betray friends.
- On the contrary.
I'm asking you to help a friend.
Dr Kieran hasn't been the same since you left.
Unfortunately, the strain of completing the naquadria project has... has taken its toll.
Lately, his behaviour has become increasingly... erratic.
How do you mean?
We're concerned that in his current state, he may be prone to errors of judgement.
We want someone to watch over him.
You mean spy on him?
He trusts you, Jonas, and he's still very important to us.
If you do this, you will be granted a full pardon.
You'll be reinstated into your position at the academy.
Your life will resume as though none of this had ever happened.
It's time, Jonas, for you to come home.
Oh, I'm tired.
You've been under a lot of strain.
I can't concentrate any more.
I've got these headaches and my mind wanders.
It'll all be over soon.
Do you think I should take Colonel O'Neill and the others to meet the Resistance?
They can help.
- l don't know if I trust them.
- You trust me, don't you?
Of course.
Don't worry, then.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You have surface-to-air missiles that are capable of destroying enemy bombers before they reach our cities.
Yes, we do, but we can't give 'em to you.
It's purely a defensive technology.
Yes, and then one day you take down enemy aircraft defending their cities, and quite suddenly, yes, quite suddenly, they become not just defensive but offensive. Any superior defensive technology can be turned into an offensive advantage.
But we are not the aggressors.
You said you wanted a quick and decisive victory.
We can only assume that means you will press any advantage we give you.
Yes - as a means of saving lives.
First Minister?
Excuse us a moment.
This is proving quite fruitless.
Have you spoken with your professor?
No, I haven't seen him today.
It seems that the Tiranians are massing their troops on our northern border.
Have they broken off diplomatic relations?
- Not yet.
- Well, then there's still a chance.
- Maybe we could talk to them.
- You? Stargate Command has teams of skilled diplomats.
It might help to have an objective third party.
- No, I'm afraid that's impossible.
- Why? That would require us to reveal the existence of the Stargate.
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.
Once they realise the advancements they can acquire through negotiations they might not be so eager to attack.
You are asking us to reveal something to our enemies that we have yet to admit to our own people.
Looks like it's time you did.
Think about it.
If everybody knew that this was just one in thousands of inhabited planets, they'd focus on similarities instead of differences.
That's a noble sentiment, Jonas.
Of course, if it were that simple I'm sure the existence of the Stargate would be public knowledge on Earth as well.
Isn't that right, Colonel?
- Who is it?
- Professor, it's me.
Jonas? Yeah, Professor.
Open up.
- Is something wrong?
- Uh... It's Tomis, Tomis Leed. He's another one of the scientists on the naquadria project.
What's wrong with him?
He was transferred overnight.
They won't say where he went.
- Was he a member of the Resistance?
- l recruited him myself.
- Now I'll get arrested.
- We don't know that.
This is not the first time.
A month ago, it was Dr Silas.
They said he was transferred and he hasn't been seen or heard from since.
We were the three original members of the project.
Now I'm the only one left.
All right. We're outta here.
- You're leaving?
- The negotiations are going nowhere, you're not helping us and, quite frankly, your organisation is about to be exposed.
Wait.
We're going to make our move in two days, but we need your help.
What are you proposing?
We're in a position to take every major government building except this one.
- This is their most guarded facility.
- Because of the Stargate.
Right. But you can come and go as you please.
You could get a hundred armed men in here before anyone knew. You could take the building from the inside.
- Not a chance.
- Think about it.
If you want the coup to succeed, it has to be quick and as bloodless as possible.
If we try to take the building ourselves we'll get caught in a firefight. - lt could dissolve into a civil war.
- Not my problem.
There's something else.
Over the past three months, I've been smuggling small amounts of naquadria into the Resistance.
We've built up a considerable stockpile.
If you help us, it's yours.
At least talk to them.
I'll set up a meeting.
- Jonas, what are you doing here?
- You're being followed.
This way.
- How far to Resistance headquarters?
- Just down that way.
Show me.
You there Don't move
What's his condition?
Well, sir, he has a severe fracture to his left tibia, but it's the blunt trauma to the head that worries me.
We'll keep him under observation for now.
- Any idea how it happened?
- According to the Kelownans, he was found lying in a deserted street.
No one knows how he got there.
Jonas convinced them he'd have a better chance of recovery with us.
- Keep me posted.
- What exactly are the Kelownans saying?
- Not much. They claim to have no knowledge of how he was injured.
He feared he was under threat from the government.
But if they suspected he was a rebel spy they'd never have let us bring him here.
His own people may have felt he'd been compromised.
The question is, what do we do now?
Do we go back to the table?
- Sir...
- General...
With respect, if we end negotiations now, we'll be backing them into a corner.
The way they see it, they'll have no choice but to strike first with a naquadria bomb.
Jonas, we'll have to do it sooner or later.
We can't give them what they want.
What about the Resistance?
If we help them seize power, we'll still get the naquadria, plus we'll save lives.
Even if we wanted to, realistically there's no way we could find them.
Actually, sir, that's not exactly true.
Major?
If Dr Kieran really did smuggle naquadria to Resistance headquarters, I can track it.
This is where they found Dr Kieran.
I'm picking something up.
This way.
Professor.
- Jonas, where am I?
- You're safe.
We need to get to the Resistance. They need help.
It's all right, it's all right.
Everything's going as planned.
We'll be making contact soon.
We have to stop the first minister from using the bomb.
We will.
We will. I never meant for it to turn out this way, Jonas.
We were scientists. We thought we were pursuing knowledge.
- We had no idea what we were creating.
- lt's not your fault.
- You have something, Doctor?
- Yes. These are Dr Kieran's PET scans.
It shows no sign of brain damage from the injury, but there is something else.
The images are consistent with someone suffering from schizophrenia.
He's one of their leading scientists, head of their most top-secret programme.
I know. I can't explain it.
The onset of this disease is extremely rare over the age of 35.
So he's functioned for at least 20 years without anyone noticing his condition.
- lt's almost inconceivable.
- What kind of symptoms are we talking?
Paranoia, delusions, possibly even full-blown hallucinations.
I'm glad you weren't there the day we tested the bomb, Jonas.
Must've been hard for you.
I'll never forget it.
The ground shook.
The air caught fire.
The destruction was unimaginable.
The Tiranian central forces are located here.
We'll move the Third Division and the reserves to this point.
- How long can we resist?
- First Minister?
We need to talk.
This way, sir.
In here.
Carter, are you sure?
Yes, sir.
This is the place.
Over here, sir.
Naquadria.
A lot of it.
We must defend ourselves.
You're gonna use the naquadria bomb.
If Earth will not help us, we have no choice.
I wish you could see what I've seen.
I have actually been on board a Goa'uld mothership.
I've seen their destructive power.
They can park in orbit and systematically annihilate every major city on our entire planet, regardless of who's Kelownan or Tiranian.
To them, we're all just potential slaves.
Jonas, the Goa'uld haven't been here for a thousand years.
What makes you think they'd come back now?
The naquadria is a derivative of naqahdah, which is the very basis of their technology.
It's literally in their blood. They can smell it.
If you continue using it, I guarantee you, eventually they will take notice.
We're leaving.
Just... wait.
What happened?
Carter and Teal'c are back at the SGC already.
- What about the Resistance?
- There is no Resistance.
It was all in his head, a fantasy.
That's impossible.
This is from Fraiser.
Dr Kieran is schizophrenic.
It might be a side effect of the research they've been doing.
The naquadria.
It's time to go home.
Jonas. What happened to Dr Silas and Dr Leed?
They weren't transferred, were they?
They were taken to a government mental facility, Jonas.
- You knew.
- No. We suspected.
We had thought that Dr Silas was a unique case.
But when Dr Leed began to exhibit similar behaviour, we became concerned.
- That's why you wanted me to watch him.
- We had to keep it quiet so as not to alarm the other scientists.
As near as I can tell, it's a unique form of brain damage resulting from long-term exposure to naquadria radiation.
I went over the specs from the bomb project.
They never had proper shielding.
- Is Jonas at risk?
- No. I already tested him. He's negative.
My guess is he didn't have enough exposure.
The Pentagon is eager to resume research on the naquadria you found at the warehouse.
It shouldn't be a problem. We are double-checking, but I think that our existing safeguards are sufficient.
I sent a message to the Kelownans offering help to upgrade their facilities.
I haven't gotten any response.
We've heard nothing from them since Colonel O'Neill and Jonas returned.
They may well be at war by now.
What about Dr Kieran?
With medication we can keep his condition from deteriorating.
Unfortunately, there's no way to reverse the damage that's already been done.
- Professor. I hear I'm being moved today.
Yeah. We're gonna take you to a facility that's better equipped to deal with your needs.
I understand everything's in place for the coup.
Really?
They're keeping me informed.
After they take power, the Resistance is going to dismantle the bomb and shut down the naquadria project for ever.
That's good, Professor.
And they couldn't have done it without you.
- Do you really think so?
- l know so.
You saved the world.

ENHOH
Receiving SG-1's IDC, sir. Request permission to open the iris.
Do it.
Welcome home, SG-1.
How did it go?
General, you know how I love those sandy planets.
The wind was most pleasant.
Jaffa sarcasm at its finest, General.
There wasn't much left to study.
Most of it has been eaten away by sandstorms.
But we did find evidence suggesting it was some sort of science outpost or observatory built by the Ancients.
That's the artefact you mentioned?
What is it?
- We're not sure.
- I'd say it's some kind of bug zapper.
All I know is it's emitting energy.
It was hidden underground, just below the main section of the ruins.
I tried picking it up and it started glowing.
Touching it must've activated it.
- You're certain it isn't dangerous?
- As certain as I can be.
My initial scans indicate that the energy it's emitting is harmless.
That makes it worthy of study as a potential power source.
Colonel
- What?
- There.
- You don't see that?
- No. What?
It just disappeared into the wall.
- What did?
- I don't know.
Something.
It was an alien creature of some kind.
You didn't see it?
It was right there. It was right there, General.
This is Hammond.
I want a class-one security lockdown of the base now.
This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill.
As you were.
In the past six hours, security teams have swept the base three times.
They found no trace whatsoever of the creature you described.
You're certain it disappeared into the wall?
Yeah.
Isn't it possible something followed us back through the gate?
Something that can penetrate solid matter?
- Is that unheard of?
- Nothing showed up on the video.
Mr Quinn, you understand I'm not questioning your judgment, but without further evidence I must return the base to normal operating status.
Yes, sir, I understand.
SG-1's had a particularly busy mission schedule lately.
You're all due for some downtime.
I suggest you take it starting right now.
Dismissed.
You only saw a flash of this creature.
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?
- You're suggesting I'm delusional? - No, no.
It's just possible you were seeing something that wasn't entirely...
Yes, that's what we're suggesting.
You think I'm having symptoms related to my prior exposure to naquadria.
- Dr Fraiser gave me a clean bill of health.
- Over three months ago.
- Jonas, we're just concerned about you.
- There was something alive down there.
It was real.
I could stay.
We've all been cleared.
The base is clean.
Jonas is probably suffering from stress.
This is all still new to him.
- You could come with.
- Sir?
Fishing. I'm going fishing.
- I'm planning on studying the artefact. - Yes.
- It's always something, isn't it?
- Come on, sir. The only reason you asked is because you knew I had something else to do.
No, really, I think you should come.
Fish, fish some more...
This is what you do with your downtime?
Colonel O'Neill asked me to go fishing with him, but I find this more relaxing.
How are you doing?
The possibility of being insane has been interfering with my ability to relax.
I figured I'd take a crack at these glyphs.
Fine with me.
But I still have no idea what we're dealing with.
I've scanned it with x-rays, ultraviolet, mild EM pulses.
Nothing has had any effect on the particles it's emitting.
- Particles?
- For lack of a better word.
They're energy patterns.
So far I haven't been able to identify them or determine their purpose.
I was hoping that the writings on the device itself would tell us more.
Let's see what it says.
The symbols are definitely a form of language used by the Ancients.
Although the Ancients have been around so long, the language has evolved. But we do have a base reference...
What?
You're telling me that you don't see that?
What?
It's right there in front of you.
OK, there's definitely something wrong with me.
No evidence of brain damage from exposure to naquadria radiation.
No indication of any viruses or toxins in your system.
CAT scan, MRls, blood work all came back clean.
He's in perfect health.
Physically.
That's all I can say definitively.
You show no signs of stress that usually accompany hallucinations.
Then why am I the only one seeing these things?
I wish I had an answer.
Until we find out exactly what's going on, I must remove you from active duty.
General Hammond, sir, these visions only started when we returned with the device.
- What are you suggesting? - I know I can't go on any missions, but at least let me continue researching the device with Major Carter.
There has to be a connection.
Major Carter has already submitted her report.
Nothing suggests the device is connected to your condition.
Until someone presents hard evidence, we have to assume it's a coincidence.
I haven't translated the writing.
You'll have to do it from video reference.
The device is being shipped to Area 51.
I can't believe they're shipping it out.
We barely got a crack at figuring out what it is.
Perhaps the scientists in Nevada will determine the device's true purpose.
Meanwhile, I'm stuck here cooling my heels.
You are welcome to join me as I kelno'reem.
No offence, Teal'c, but it doesn't quite have the same effect on me.
No other plans?
Colonel O'Neill requested that I accompany him fishing.
- I'm the only one he didn't invite.
- You are not permitted to leave the base.
Still...
Be extremely happy that he did not ask.
Why, you don't like fishing?
Seeing as how I've read every book in the base library twice, I guess I'll get back to work on my...
- You saw that?
- Indeed.
Hey, there.
You just caught me fixing a carburettor.
- I didn't hear you pull in.
- No problem.
You sure?
It's a full-service station. The price includes yours truly.
- I got it, thanks.
- All right.
At least I can wash your windows for you.
What do you get, five miles to the gallon in this thing?
Yeah, it's a pig.
I'm more of an El Camino fan, myself.
The things are like catnip to the ladies.
Don't I know it?
- What?
- Get down.
The money's inside in a lockbox
- I'm not gonna rob you.
Just get down.
- Getting down.
- Don't kill me, please.
I'm a vet.
- I'm not gonna kill you.
Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force.
Did you see anything?
Just my life flashing before my eyes.
What the hell were you shooting at?
- It's classified.
- You can tell me.
I work here.
If there's something going on, I should know about it.
- O'Neill for Hammond.
- I served in the Gulf.
- What division?
- Motor pool.
Oh, man, my sign.
Patching through a call from Colonel O'Neill, sir.
Colonel, where are you?
About 30 clicks north, sir.
I just saw something... fairly interesting.
- They've breached base containment. - Sir?
We're seeing them here, too. They're everywhere.
Anything?
It says something about an experiment, but I'm hung up on a few of these glyphs.
They were studying beings of the something something.
According to this, it should be "inner layer", the beings of the inner layer.
- But that doesn't make much sense.
- Not really.
Maybe "other level"?
- What about "another dimension"?
- That could work.
It'd make sense if they're inhabiting a dimension close to ours.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. Thanks.
Is that it?
Sorry, I'm working as fast as I can.
I know.
General Hammond wants a full report as soon as possible.
Look, I'm the one who's sorry.
We should never have doubted you about what you saw.
It's understandable, with the whole naquadria-poisoning thing.
Besides, I am still the new guy.
You're part of the team now and you deserve our respect.
You've earned it.
Jonas, you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
- Now, figure out what else this thing says.
- Right.
Colonel O'Neill will stay in Colorado Springs and coordinate the quarantine.
The National Guard is standing by.
The president is prepared to declare a state of emergency.
Hopefully, these things, whatever they are, haven't gotten too far.
We're not sure we can contain them.
- You halted the transfer of the device?
- Yes, and we've learned more.
I think I've translated enough of the writings to figure out its purpose.
It's broadcasting energy particles.
We're not sure, but we think they're triggering an ability to see the creatures.
Hopefully, only those exposed to the particles will develop this second sight.
None of the ciphers we have fit perfectly, but, as I understand it, the device is meant to allow us to observe beings that exist in a parallel dimension.
We think the energy particles create a bleed-through effect, causing anyone exposed to them to see into this parallel dimension.
We can't contain them because they aren't here?
They do exist, just not in any way that allows us to interact with them.
They didn't follow us through the gate.
- Where did they come from?
- The ones we're seeing are from Earth.
These creatures could exist anywhere.
We've just been unaware of them.
- What is your threat assessment?
- I can't say for sure, but with regards to the creatures, none.
If they only exist in their dimension, they can't harm us.
There's no physiological interaction beyond our ability to see them.
While we might be able to deal with seeing interdimensional beings...
If the effect spreads to the general public, we could have a disaster.
They're not used to seeing unusual things like we are.
And we can't control when or where a sighting occurs.
Imagine a surgeon doing delicate surgery and he's distracted.
- Or an air-traffic controller.
- Even something like driving a car.
People might be able to deal with it, but not before it turns the world upside down.
Not to mention the exposure of the Stargate programme in trying to explain it.
Shut off that device.
- We've tried, sir.
- Find a way.
Colonel O'Neill says there haven't been any further sightings.
We've triangulated the sightings to a 500-metre radius around the device.
It attracts the creatures to it, most likely part of its design.
The closer we get to the machine, the more frequently we'll see our friends.
We've been unable to find any types of controls or switches.
The last resort is separating the main crystal core from the unit.
Hopefully, that will stop it from functioning.
- What are you waiting for?
- This is an advanced piece of technology.
- I have no idea what effect it will have.
- If this effect continues to spread...
Attempting to remove crystal core.
My scans are no longer detecting any particle emissions from the device.
Anyone see anything?
- Any sightings?
- Not me.
- My kelno'reem was undisturbed.
- We may have solved the problem.
Teal'c thinks we should take it back.
Take it back? We've barely scratched the surface of what it can do.
Now it's shut off, it's safe to study.
To what end?
The effect that device had was groundbreaking.
- Once we figure out how to use it...
- Eventually.
- These creatures are worth studying.
- The Ancients certainly thought so.
They're aware of matter in our dimension or they wouldn't rest on objects we see as solid.
Plus they can pass through solid matter.
Also, the ones we've encountered seem to demonstrate a higher intelligence, - but that doesn't mean we can't...
Sergeant?
Mission time is 24 minutes, three seconds.
MALP AV link to P9X-391 is up and running.
SG-1, this is Hammond.
What's your status?
We're in the ruins, about to enter the antechamber where we found the device.
- Anything coming through the wormhole?
- Negative.
No unidentified energy patterns are being detected.
Does that mean we're free and clear?
Even if we can shut the device down, it's possible there was residual particle radiation my instruments couldn't detect.
- This should take care of that.
- It's back where we found it.
There's nothing else here that would explain what happened with the device.
Once the gate is shut down, it should cut off any energy patterns being broadcast.
Affirmative.
We'll re-establish contact in one hour.
Hammond out.
- Shut it down. - Yes, sir.
- Deactivating wormhole.
- I'll be in my office.
Uh, sir...
Are you certain bringing the device back here was the right decision?
It's the only way we can solve this, sir.
Returning the device to P9X-391 should have worked.
It couldn't project an effect from off-world without the Stargate being active.
Why do we still possess the ability to see these creatures?
The effect the particles have on us must be persistent.
Hopefully, it's not permanent.
New sightings have been reported on base by personnel not previously affected.
The situation is getting worse.
It doesn't make sense.
Without exposure...
- What if it's not the particles?
- How can that be?
One function of the device was to attract the creatures.
When we shut that down, or thought we shut it down, they seemed to go away.
I get it.
What if the particles were only what was attracting them?
Sure, like food.
Now, shutting down that part of the device just made the creatures leave the area.
Whatever's giving us the ability to see them is something completely different.
Something unrelated to the device?
No, sir, that seems unlikely, but it could be something we've missed.
OK, I was the first one to see the creatures, right?
I was also the first one to touch the device.
Teal'c was next.
Touching the device could have altered our bodies' electrical field enough to cause the bleed-through effect.
But that doesn't explain the people who had no direct contact with the device.
Unless the charge can be passed on from person to person.
Like a contagion.
I'll order the containment of Colorado Springs and surrounding area.
We'll also need to isolate anyone who had physical contact with SGC personnel.
Son of a...
Thank you.
Yes. Keep me apprised.
We're getting reports of sightings.
No one's been hurt, but a local news station has picked up the story.
Colonel O'Neill is rounding up anyone he may have come in contact with.
- The quarantine is otherwise in place.
- What's our cover story?
A spill of an experimental chemical that can have an hallucinogenic effect.
So far, people are buying it.
But that won't work for long.
This may be our only chance to contain this problem.
If we can't...
Mass hysteria.
This is our mistake, Major. We need to fix it.
Yes, sir.
Careful.
- Interesting.
- What?
Do you think the configuration affects the nature of the charge the device emits?
We reorder the crystals, we change what the device does.
Why else would they be arranged this way?
There are a number of configurations to choose from.
How do we know which one will elicit the right effect?
This could take a while.
There's no one here, sir.
Leave someone here in case he comes back.
Vernon?
There was a huge bug on my car.
No, I swear.
Did anyone see that?
Huge bug
You're certain you've reprogrammed the device properly?
To be honest, sir, we're not sure, but this is one of the last few configurations to try.
We're hoping it's now programmed to emit a charge that reverses the effect.
OK, here goes.
Feel anything?
Not really.
Do you see anything?
Do you?
When you want to see one...
There.
Where?
Right there on the device.
If there's a creature right there, then I'm not seeing it.
I think it worked, sir.
I'm not seeing it any more.
Well done, Major.
The antidote seems to be working.
No new sightings and everyone affected is no longer seeing creatures.
We need to spread the cure to Colonel O'Neill and the containment team so they can spread it through the exposed area.
I recommend a placebo pill to sell it to the public, and, provided the containment holds, we should be able to undo the damage.
- Hammond. Sir, an individual I came in contact with has breached the quarantine.
- Anything we can do?
- Get Carter and Jonas on this.
The man is Vernon Sharpe, a non-com, served in the motor pool in the Gulf.
- See what they come up with.
- Right away.
We have an exposed man on the run.
- How far you headed?
- As far as you can take me.
I'm picking up a cousin in Hawthorne County.
- That's fine.
- Hop in.
(radio) The latest update on the situation in Colorado.
The National Guard continues to maintain its quarantine of Colorado Springs after a chemical spill may have had an adverse effect on some residents.
You hear about that?
People say they're seeing monsters.
Yeah, I know. Crazy.
Vernon Sharpe drained all the money from his accounts several hours ago.
You can get this information this easily?
We only use the privilege in certain circumstances.
He could be anywhere by now.
We've frozen his credit cards, but since he's using cash, he'll be harder to trace.
So he's just gonna vanish?
That makes no sense.
- What do you mean?
- He's ex-military.
It can't simply be fear of these creatures.
What's he running for?
He doesn't buy the cover story.
The only way we'll find him is by learning more about him.
Can we find out if he has any friends or family in the area?
What's he gone and done now?
He hasn't done anything, Mrs Sharpe.
We're just very worried about Vernon.
Cookie?
Thank you.
I know how you feel.
I've been worrying about Vernon since he was a boy.
I was the one who raised him after his mother ran off, you know.
- I'm sure you did a fine job.
- She was a real floozy, that one.
My Roger never had much taste in women.
Mrs Sharpe, we're afraid that your grandson may suspect that the government is after him for the wrong reasons.
Why are you after him?
Vernon may have been exposed to a chemical that could be causing him to see things that aren't really there.
Like when he was in the war.
What do you mean?
The military did all kinds of things to those boys while they were over there.
Experiments with chemical weapons and such.
Messed with their heads good.
My Vernon's never been the same.
We don't really know anything about that.
I'm sure you don't, honey.
It's very, very important that we find your grandson.
He could be putting other people's lives in danger, ma'am.
- Vernon wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Unintentionally, of course.
The truth is, Vernon's exposure to this chemical wasn't an accident.
It wasn't even a chemical.
It was a contagious experimental germ developed by the military.
Really?
It was created to try and undo what happened to your grandson in the Gulf.
Oh, I find that hard to believe.
I swear. I wouldn't lie to you.
Unfortunately, there were some unexpected side effects to this antidote.
Those doctors will be the death of us all.
See all those pills I'm supposed to take?
I never take any of 'em.
We want to make this right, and it's not just your grandson's life that's at stake.
There could be other people in danger.
I promise nothing bad will happen to Vernon.
Well, you seem like a nice enough couple.
- Oh, we're not...
- Please, we really wanna help.
Well, Lord knows Vernon needs help.
He's not right in the head, that boy.
- We'll do our best.
- Do you know where he might be?
If he's off anywhere, it's to see that Chuck fellow.
Chuck?
He's trouble. Always has been, always will.
I told Vernon straight away, "That Chuck will lead you to no good."
Does Chuck have a last name?
I'm sure he does.
I just don't know it.
Do you know where he lives?
- Thanks for the lift.
- Good luck, Vernon.
I need a one-way ticket to Las Vegas.
Just what we need, a conspiracy theorist.
One who happens to be right about there being a conspiracy.
There has been another sighting in Hawthorne County.
Any word on Vernon?
The affected person says he picked up a hitchhiker matching his description.
Thanks.
- It's me, sir.
We believe Vernon may be at Piedmont Hawthorne airfield on his way to Vegas.
Have Hammond ground all flights.
Containment team is en route.
- ETA's about 40 minutes.
- Have you been cleared?
Somebody from the SGC shook our hands.
Sir, Vernon could be extremely paranoid.
Given his military background, use caution in apprehending him.
I'll keep that in mind.
- Good job, Carter.
- Thank you, sir.
They cancelled my flight.
What did they think of the script?
What?
The second-act twist is totally clear.
I'm sorry, but we've just been told the flight has been cancelled.
Please return to the terminal where more information will be provided.
There he is.
Let's move.
You guys cover the exits.
I'll take it from here.
You can't get away.
It's Jack O'Neill.
Colonel O'Neill?
The Air Force?
Look, I know this is a massive cliché, but... the place is surrounded.
Yeah, you're telling me.
Those monsters are everywhere.
All right, I know you're seeing things.
It's gotta be a little confusing.
- You're gonna kill me for what I know.
- Nobody's gonna kill you.
It's the Gulf all over again, only this time it's innocent civilians too.
You're doing scientific research on us.
You won't get away with it.
The truth will get out.
You know, you're right.
Our cover story is bogus.
It is?
Yep. But the truth isn't what you think.
Those creatures you're seeing, they're aliens.
Come on.
Hey, you wanted the truth, that's it.
I work for a top-secret branch of the military that deals with extraterrestrials.
- That's what you were seeing.
- You're serious?
Yes, very serious.
But the thing is... those things, they're no threat to us.
If you couldn't see them, you wouldn't know they were there.
No, but I am seeing them.
In fact, I'm seeing one right now.
Well, we can make it so you don't.
Then what?
Look, Vernon, this can't get out, not yet.
The world is not ready to know.
So you just want me to keep it quiet?
Well, think about it.
Who's gonna believe you?
Government experiments are one thing, but we're talking aliens here.
- Yeah, but other people have seen them.
- Not for long.
Besides, they're all buying our cover story.
Vernon, your country needs you.
I'm asking you, one soldier to another, play ball on this.
OK.
I'm not taking any pills or needles or anything.
You won't have to.
We're all clear.
- We good?
- Yes, sir.
- What planet are they from?
- Who?
The aliens.
A place called Melmac.
Isn't that where Alf is from?
- Who?
- Alf, you know, on TV, the puppet.
Never saw it.
No kidding?
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":
You can't take down the entire NID, and they'll kill you for trying.
You might be able to hold the evidence over them and get Hammond reinstated.
- I'm not leavin' till I get what I came for.
- And what are you going to do?
Well, I was thinking about shootin' ya.
Kinsey's online activities connect him to NID actions over the last year and a half.
Hell, you've been back in time, forward in time. You've seen it all.
I just wonder how things turn out.
I wonder how far you'd go to stop me becoming president of the United States.
Senator's been hit!
The assassination of Senator Kinsey has sent shock waves through Washington.
With his party's convention just weeks away, the senator was considered their most likely choice for second spot on the presidential ticket.
Hey! I'm back.
What'd I miss?
Sir, Senator Kinsey is dead. He was shot.
- It's been all over the news for three days.
- I've been on vacation.
- It looks like a professional hit.
The shooter fired from a hotel room across the street and then disappeared.
- Any suspects?
- Police aren't saying anything.
One can assume that a man in Senator Kinsey's position will have many enemies.
Colonel.
General.
I'm sorry, but these men are here to escort you to Peterson.
You'll be flown to Andrews and turned over to the authorities in Washington.
Sir, what is this?
Colonel O'Neill is under arrest for the murder of Senator Kinsey.
What?
- You'll have to come with us, sir.
- I don't think so.
- Colonel...
- General, I've been on vacation.
I believe you, Jack, but for the moment we're going to have to cooperate.
- There's no way Colonel O'Neill did this.
- Yes, Major, but my hands are tied.
How could they think he did it? He wasn't in Washington.
Actually, it looks like he was.
Major Davis is acting as liaison between the Pentagon and the district attorney.
- He has a report for us. Major?
- Thank you, sir.
This is from a security camera in a hotel across the street from the shooting, just a couple of minutes after it happened.
The trajectory of the bullet indicates that the shot did in fact come from this hotel.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- Based on this, the FBI searched the colonel's house and his cabin.
They didn't find anything. But a neighbour said they saw Colonel O'Neill dumping something by the lake.
They sent down a diver, who came up with this.
Ballistics match it with the bullet that killed Senator Kinsey.
I don't know what to say, sir.
It's no secret there was bad blood between them.
Come on. They had a few run- ins. That's hardly a motive for murder.
I've read the file on Kinsey, but it is a little vague.
The senator was involved with individuals who were unhappy with the way Stargate Command was being run.
They tried to force General Hammond to resign.
Colonel O'Neill connected Kinsey to their illegal activities and threatened to go public unless he got them to back off.
So, technically, Kinsey was protecting the SGC.
True, but he wasn't happy about it.
But that's not a motive to kill him. It's a motive to keep him alive.
Unfortunately, we can divulge none of this information to the civilian authorities.
Senator Kinsey was shot in broad daylight on a public street, in front of civilian witnesses.
If we tried to shift this to a military court, it would be a disaster for the current administration.
With respect, the current administration owes a lot to the colonel.
I'm aware of that, Major, as is the president.
Unfortunately, there's nothing he can do for Colonel O'Neill at this time.
On the other hand, I'm not a politician, which is why I'm suspending SG-1's offworld duties and assigning you to get to the bottom of this.
The full resources of this command are at your disposal.
- Thank you, sir.
- Dismissed.
How are you doin'?
I'm accused of a murder I didn't commit.
How do you think I'm doin'?
When are you being transferred to Washington?
Couple of days.
General Hammond has suspended our offworld duties in order that we may investigate this situation further.
Unfortunately, it's not going very well.
There is evidence that places you at the scene of the shooting.
I was fishing.
Look, Kinsey wasn't exactly my best buddy, and on occasion I felt like beating the crap out of him, but I didn't kill him.
They somehow have a video that clearly places you in Washington DC three days ago.
I don't believe this.
We know you've been on secret missions before.
I wasn't on a mission, Jonas. I was in Minnesota, on vacation.
Did you encounter anyone that can verify your story?
I was 20 miles away from the closest town, alone.
That was the point.
Perhaps this is all part of an elaborate plan.
Those responsible chose to act at a time when they knew you would have no alibi.
I checked the video to see if it had been doctored, but it appears to be genuine.
So either that really is Colonel O'Neill or someone who looks exactly like him.
We have encountered duplicating technology before.
I was thinking the same thing, but those mimic devices are under heavy guard.
Mimic devices?
Someone wanna fill me in?
Three years ago, we had a foothold situation here at the SGC.
Aliens gained control by using mimic devices to impersonate and then replace base personnel, including myself.
- Why haven't I heard this before?
- Given the seriousness of the breach, a decision was made to erase all mention of the incident from official records.
- Where are these devices now?
- Area 51.
- How many do you have?
- We recovered 12 from the SGC. They're all stored here.
- Has anyone studied them recently?
- We've all been focusing on the X- 303.
There we go. All present and accounted for.
It's a fake.
All the mimic devices were switched.
Someone duplicated the duplicators?
The last test was six months ago.
It could have been taken any time after that.
There has got to be some way that we can use this to clear you.
I don't think the alien- technology defence is gonna fly.
If I understand this, there is someone out there that can make himself look exactly like you. That's gotta be relevant.
It's classified information, Jonas.
But we can use it to find the real assassin...maybe.
- So how do these things work?
- It's a two- part process.
First, you pass a person through a scanning device, which uploads their image into a holographic sequencer.
- Which looks like this.
- Exactly.
Then you place that sequencer on your body and you instantly take on the appearance of the person scanned.
- Was the scanning device taken?
- No, it's still at Area 51.
We checked it.
So they can only impersonate a limited number of people.
12, to be precise, including Colonel O'Neill, Dr Fraiser and Daniel.
What about General Hammond?
The alien impersonating him was trapped with several others.
They activated some kind of self- destruct and blew themselves up.
In case you're wondering, Teal'c and I were never scanned.
That's good to know.
I've requested all the personnel files on those who had access to these devices.
I'd like the two of you to check them out.
- What about you?
- I'm going to Washington.
I need to look up an old acquaintance.
Major Carter. I'm here to see Agent Barrett.
Major Carter.
I was wondering how long it would be before you came by.
Welcome to NID headquarters.
Only eight people at Area 51 have had authorised access to the mimic devices.
- We must speak to them all.
- Most have moved to the X- 303 project, so they're still living in Nevada.
Wait a minute. There's something.
Dr Brent Langham.
Deceased.
Killed in an automobile accident three weeks ago.
Given the circumstance, that would seem to be a highly unlikely coincidence.
What exactly are you implying here, Major? That the NID had a hand in the assassination of a US senator?
Very few organisations have the resources to pull off something like this.
And the man accused happens to belong to one of them.
The SGC is not behind this.
Senator Kinsey was no friend of the Stargate Command.
He tried to take you down more than once.
We don't engage in criminal activity, Agent Barrett, unlike the NID.
The Prometheus incident was orchestrated by a handful of rogue agents.
What about Steveston, Oregon?
You sat by and watched while the Goa'uld took over an entire town of civilians.
That was an officially sanctioned operation.
It would've succeeded if it wasn't for you.
Are you kidding me?
Your agents were compromised and your organisation was about to be infiltrated.
Look, Major... The videotape of Colonel O'Neill clearly places him at the scene of the crime, and the murder weapon was found near his cabin.
So, if you'll excuse me...
I've got work to do.
It says here that by 2075 the Earth's oceans will be too warm to sustain most coral reefs and, once they're gone, the ecosystem of the planet will collapse.
That's a cheerful thought.
We spend all of our time trying to protect the world from the Goa'uld.
Maybe we should worry a little more about protecting it from ourselves.
What are we doing out here, Agent Barrett?
My office is bugged.
It's standard procedure to record all conversations in NID headquarters.
What I'm about to say, Major, nobody else can know, especially my superiors.
What are you talking about?
There's a cancer at the NID, a shadow organisation that operates outside the law.
- It's time they were exposed.
- I agree.
The Prometheus incident was the last straw.
I was called to the White House for an assignment.
What does this have to do with Colonel O'Neill?
Senator Kinsey was working for me.
He was about to give me enough evidence to bring down the leadership of the group.
How did you convince him to do that?
I know about a few of the skeletons in the senator's closet.
- And it is an election year.
- You blackmailed him.
I'll do whatever it takes to bring these people down, Major.
Who else knows about this?
As of this moment, the president, a few members of his staff, and you.
- You're working alone?
- The smaller the operation, the better.
You have no idea how far the corruption goes.
The SGC isn't immune.
You're taking a big risk talking to me.
I need your help.
And you haven't told me everything.
What makes you so sure that Colonel O'Neill is innocent?
When you work with someone that long, you know.
There's something more than that. There's something you're not telling me.
Your job requires you to be suspicious of everybody, even your co- workers.
Where I'm from, we trust each other with our lives every day.
Maybe that's something you can't understand.
I guess it's never too late to learn.
When the mimic devices were found, eight scientists were assigned to study them.
The Pentagon hoped to adapt the devices for use in the field.
However, while the holographic images created by the aliens lasted indefinitely, those created in the lab only lasted for three to four minutes at a time, due to problems with electromagnetic interference.
So the project was scaled back, and five of the team members were reassigned.
The remaining three were Dr Singh, Dr Healey, and this fellow - Dr Brent Langham.
They continued working for six months with no breakthroughs.
Finally, the project was shut down.
Dr Healey and Dr Singh were transferred to the X- 303 project.
And Dr Langham?
He was supposedly killed in a car crash two days before the transfer was due.
The body was burned. He was identified through dental records.
But the coroner missed something.
Toxicology report came back clean.
No signs of any drugs or alcohol in the victim's blood.
- Why is that unusual?
- Dr Langham was epileptic.
His condition required regular doses of anticonvulsant drugs.
There should have been traces of those drugs.
The dental records were falsified.
The body recovered at the crash site was someone else.
So you're saying this Dr Langham took the mimic device - and engineered his own disappearance.
- Or someone engineered it for him.
Are we suggesting, then, that this scientist shot Kinsey?
I doubt it. He had no paramilitary training.
Perhaps Dr Langham merely provided the mimic devices for a fee.
But he can lead us to whoever was responsible.
I don't care what it takes. I want you to find this Dr Langham. Yes, sir.
OK, what is this?
The rifle used to kill Senator Kinsey was not one you pick up at your local store.
This is a one- stop shop for unregistered weapons.
High- end goods, professional clientele.
There's a chance our shooter was here.
Why don't you shut them down?
I let them operate in exchange for information.
Sometimes you gotta cross the line.
You just gotta know when to step back.
- Hey, Leo. - Leo.
Agent Barrett.
When are you gonna get yourself a new suit?
- Black is good for any occasion.
- It's also thinning.
Who's your friend?
Major Samantha Carter, United States Air Force.
We can talk in front of her.
What can I do for you?
We wanna know about a 700 with a customised breakdown stock.
Yeah. I moved one last week.
In all likelihood, the weapon you sold was used to assassinate a US senator.
What's your point?
Was the buyer a regular customer?
No, I never seen him before.
- Is that the guy?
- That's the guy.
Did he look at any other weapons besides the 700?
As a matter of fact, he did.
A sound- suppressed revolver rifle.
- Did he handle it?
- Sure.
- Was he wearing gloves? - No.
- Has anybody handled it since?
- No, just Leo here.
How much?
There's one full set of prints and one partial, but neither of them match Colonel O'Neill.
It's a little strange.
Assuming the full set matches Leo, that would mean the partial belongs to the shooter.
- Maybe.
- It's the best lead we have.
The shooter probably won't have a criminal record. In fact, there's a good chance he may not exist on any database at all.
Except maybe NID personnel files.
You said it yourself, Agent Barrett - there's a cancer in your organisation.
Kinsey was gonna bring them down, so they had him killed.
So did they hire an outside contractor or use one of their own?
Give me the disk.
I'll check the files and call you in a couple of hours.
Good call, checking for a second weapon.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
So where do we start?
It is probable that Dr Langham has assumed a new identity.
New name, new address, new social security number.
Can't change his medical condition.
Do not many thousands of people suffer from this affliction?
Yes, but there's a wide range of treatments.
Dr Langham was on specific drugs, including primidone and carbamazepine.
So...we can access the national pharmaceutical database and focus on new prescriptions written in the past three weeks.
We cross- reference that with age and gender, and we should be able to narrow down the field.
- Have Teal'c and Jonas found anything?
- They have a lead on a missing scientist.
They think he may have taken the mimic devices.
If the shooter was NID, we can track him using the prints from the second rifle.
What about this Agent Barrett? Are you sure you can trust him?
I think so.
You mustn't tell him about the foothold incident.
I shouldn't have even told Jonas.
I know, sir. I'm hoping it won't come to that.
I'll keep you posted, sir.
- You were right.
The prints match an NID agent named Mark Devlin.
- How'd you learn to drive?
- Daniel Jackson instructed me.
- When was that?
- I believe the year was 1969.
- Can I help you?
- We're looking for a Mr David Zwydel.
- That's me.
What's this about?
- Our apologies.
- You are not the man we are looking for.
- Sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Have a good day.
- That guy look familiar to you?
- He did not.
Really?
He looked familiar to me.
No, wait, wait, wait.
I know that guy.
When I first came to Stargate Command, he was an airman in the gate room. I'm positive.
Mr Zwydel.
Around back.
Nice shot.
Dr Langham, I presume.
Indeed.
- You found Dr Langham.
- He's in a holding cell on level 16.
- Well done. Has he said anything?
- No, sir. But he did ask for a lawyer.
That could be a problem.
We're not following proper procedure here.
Sir, he stole top- secret material and is an accessory to murder.
Dr Langham is also the only one that can verify Colonel O'Neill's innocence.
Major Carter and Agent Barrett are pursuing a lead that may take them to the real assassin.
- And if it doesn't?
- I know how you feel.
No one wants Colonel O'Neill back more than I do, but this is a delicate situation.
I understand this man had some injuries when you brought him in.
Dr Langham was reluctant to accompany us back to the SGC. - He required some convincing.
- All I'm saying is we have to be careful.
We're way outside our jurisdiction and, like it or not, this man has rights.
He will volunteer the information.
Of that I am certain.
Look, this is a waste of time.
I got nothing to say.
OK, I took the mimic devices, but I didn't know what they were planning to do.
What? You think I'm part of some kinda murder conspiracy?
Well, you're wrong.
All right, I'll tell you what I know, but you have to promise me protection.
I'll get us in.
- What are you doing?
- Covering you.
Thank you.
Get up.
When you switched the devices, where'd you take them?
Washington.
They wanted me to take them myself, because using a middleman would be too risky.
- To whom are you referring?
- They call themselves the Committee.
They run the whole show.
We're going to need names.
This is conspiracy to commit murder.
I didn't know they'd use the devices to kill anybody.
They told me they were gonna analyse the technology for commercial applications.
Why would you believe that?
You don't think money has anything to do with this?
In six months, there have been at least ten new patents traceable to Area 51.
I'm talking industrial chemicals, metallurgy, computers, you name it.
- So they're selling alien technology?
- No, they're buying it.
The members of the Committee aren't secret agents, they're businessmen.
The rogue NID agents work for them.
They got millions invested and they expect to make billions by incorporating alien advancements into their product lines.
This was about protecting the planet.
Nobody said it had to be a non- profit business.
Give us the names and we'll ensure your safety.
Well, I'm gonna need a few more details.
You work for the air force. You don't have witness protection.
But we do have the Stargate.
- What do you mean?
- If these men are as powerful as you say, there's probably nowhere on Earth you'd be safe.
Fortunately, we have other options.
We need to talk. Who else knows about this operation at Stargate Command?
Why?
- We've got a leak, Major.
- Wait a minute.
Agent Devlin was waiting for us.
Somebody tipped him off.
Not necessarily.
Think about it.
You used a computer to access those personnel files.
Maybe somebody tracked you. -
- Don't answer that.
- It's General Hammond.
- If they think we're dead, that's good.
You trust me, you trust my team.
Sir, what's happening?
Did he talk?
No, that's great news.
Yes, sir. Understood.
What is it?
We've got the names of those responsible for the assassination.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We have an inside source.
Who?
I can't.
This assignment came from the White House.
If you don't tell me what I need to know, I'm gonna have to make a phone call.
You're the one who's always talking about trust.
The man who shot Kinsey was using a piece of alien technology. A device which creates a flawless holographic disguise - in this case, a duplicate image of Colonel O'Neill.
It was a perfect plan to get rid of Kinsey and the colonel.
Wait a minute. Why have I never heard about this technology before?
We encountered the devices during a foothold situation.
It was a close one.
Kinsey wanted to shut down the Stargate programme, so it was covered up by presidential order.
- Who's your source?
- A scientist at Area 51.
- He smuggled the devices out.
- That's not enough.
They're onto us.
If we don't move fast, they'll disappear.
We need more than one scientist who made a deal for immunity.
That's all we have.
What?
Senator Kinsey's not dead. He's in a coma.
- We've got him under 24- hour guard.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because we needed to keep his condition a secret for his protection.
If he recovers, he can provide us with the information to bring these people down.
- So we were both keeping secrets.
- That's the way the game's played.
You've got a...
Anyway, the Pentagon's been informed.
They're sending a man to the hospital. - Did I...?
- Close enough.
- Who are they sending?
- A liaison officer.
- Major Davis. - Major Davis, yeah.
What?
There are 12 alien devices capable of mimicking specific individuals.
Major Davis was one of them.
- Sergeant.
- Major Davis.
- I've come to check on the senator. - Yes, sir.
- Agent Devlin, how did it go?
- Kinsey's dead.
Are you sure?
He was supposed to be dead the first time.
He wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest this time. So, yeah, I'm sure.
There were a few complications, though.
- What's goin' on?
- Fire alarm. We need to move him.
We must ask you to wait here, sir.
Why is that, Sergeant?
Secondary casualties are not our concern. Major Davis can answer for those as well.
We still have a loose end.
They have Dr Langham in custody.
That's not important. His accusations will be a minor inconvenience for us.
I suggest we use the mimic devices to eliminate another thorn in our side.
- Someone at the SGC?
- General Hammond.
Once he's gone, we can replace him with someone more sympathetic to us.
If they know about the devices, they'll be prepared.
Devlin's right.
Besides, now that Kinsey's dead, we have other options.
I think it's time we sent someone to talk to Hammond, get him to reconsider those retirement plans.
He doesn't seem like the type to bow to pressure.
Well, then, we are going to have to be very convincing.
Agent Devlin, I would like you to pay General Hammond a visit.
Impress upon him our concerns for the safety and wellbeing of his family.
If he still refuses to play ball?
Then kill him.
What is this?
General Hammond sends his regards.
Get your hands up. Come on, get'em up.
The hologram lasted six and a half minutes.
That's a new record for us.
- You took a big risk.
- I knew you were listening.
What makes you think I was gonna come in before they incriminated themselves?
When you work with someone, you just know.
Ah, Colonel O'Neill.
Glad you could make it.
What do you want, Kinsey?
I thought we should have a little chat before we meet the press.
Did you need to gloat a little?
Don't be that way, Jack.
You need this as much as I do.
You'll only get public vindication if the two of us appear on the 6 o'clock news shaking hands.
Yeah. I'm not sure it's worth it.
The American people don't want their air- force officers to be assassins, Jack.
They want them to be heroes.
I'm gonna make you a hero.
Shall we?
First of all, I want to apologise to you and to the American people for the deception surrounding my untimely demise.
It was an unfortunate but necessary final step in my investigation of certain antidemocratic forces that had taken root in several key government agencies.
The ringleaders of this conspiracy have now been taken into custody.
Of course, taking a bullet was not part of my original plan to bring these men down.
But the success of the operation was well worth any personal sacrifice on my part.
And I want the American people to know that, if elected, I intend to bring that same determination and zeal for justice with me to the White House.
I would also like to thank Colonel Jack O'Neill of the United States Air Force for the vital role he played in my investigation.
I can't go into details for reasons of national security, but I can assure you all that any evidence pointing to the colonel as my would- be assassin was simply part of the operation.
Colonel.
Smile, Colonel.
You just won me the election.

- l have a task for you, Her'ak.
How may I serve you, my Lord?
This mission is very important, so there's not much time.
If you succeed, Anubis himself will be most pleased.
I have learned the location of certain enemies. They are currently vulnerable.
You will take my Ha'tak, capture them, and bring them to me... alive.
My Lord, may I ask who is so valuable?
Three humans and a Jaffa, known to the Tauri as SG-1 .
I calculate platform mass at 12.9 metric tons.
Consistent with the one on P4X-233.
And every other ring transporter we've measured. Suggests standardisation.
Think the Goa'uld have a big plant somewhere just stamps these things out?
Jay, how's it coming with the energy levels left in that power cell?
The power cell?
- The power cell?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm workin' on it.
No, you're not.
Look at them. They are so cool.
- Jay, enough already. lt's embarrassing.
- Not to mention unprofessional.
Guys, we're in the presence of greatness here, the best of the best.
Here we are, working alongside them.
Savour the moment, gentlemen. Savour the moment.
We're studying an old piece of Goa'uld technology, and they're baby-sitting us.
What do you think they're talkin' about right now?
So, T, who you takin' in the Cup?
Lord Stanley's Cup?
Hockey.
Remember, with the ice and skating?
- We went to a game last year.
- indeed.
I believe the Canucks of Vancouver are superior warriors.
Canucks, eh?
So, lunch?
Here they come.
Yes, that does look like a very important breakthrough.
It's good work, Coombs.
Carry on.
- Progress, Professor?
- Definitely. Yes.
Big stuff goin' on here.
I can give you a full report.
Save it for Carter.
We just came for the fine cuisine.
Of course.
Her DHD reports are unbelievable, aren't they?
She is single-handedly revolutionising our knowledge of Stargate technology.
Any word on how that's going?
- Turkey. - Turkey there.
- l'll just get back to work.
- Are you near the end of your research?
- (crash) - (Coombs) Who put that scanner there?
Well, it may be a few more days yet.
- What's your time frame there?
- A day or so.
