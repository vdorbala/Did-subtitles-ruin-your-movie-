Chamomile tea?
Feeling better?
Well, I haven't been to the bathroom in 10 minutes.
I guess that's progress.
- Hey, at least someone's happy.
- She should be. She T.P.'d the bathroom, the hallway and half the kitchen... while I made tea.
God. She's not even walking yet.
- Did you take your temperature?
- Yeah.
- But-
- Okay. - Should I call or do you want to?
- I'm presenting at grand rounds.
- Not with the stomach flu, you're not.
- Mark. Hi, I'm calling for Dr. Corday.
Yeah, she's projectile vomiting. Do you still want her to come in?
- Very funny.
I'm calling right back.
I just need loperamide.
Then I'll be fine.
What you need to do is stay in bed.
- What about Ella?
- Katherine's coming over.
Who's gonna look after her till then?
I'm not doing anything today.
- Hey, Rach. - I can watch her if you want.
I wouldn't want you to give up your Saturday.
- It's freezing out anyway.
I'm late. You, stay in bed.
Hello. Haleh, gallstone in 4 needs Toradol. Can you check the labs on Cathy Jensen?
- Upper GI bleed?
- Yeah. - Is Dr. Chen in yet?
- Nope. - Get the message he was looking for you?
- No. Oh, really?
- In just a swim cap?
And a Speedo.
- You've gotta try it.
- In January in Lake Michigan? - It has a spiritual quality.
- You wanted to see me, Robert?
Yes. Just discussing with Dr. Lewis what a tough year it's been. What with personnel changes, lawsuits and whatnot.
Can you believe Dr. Romano's a member of the Polar Bear Club?
Can you excuse us?
Stay.
I've found a solution... - ... for the administrative bottleneck-
- Bottleneck? - Your QAs are a month behind.
- Which you'll have by day's end. I'm sorry. Does she really need to be here for this?
Actually, I have a patient.
- Well, that was elegant.
- Look, you can't expect me to do low-priority administrative work while I'm clocking more clinical shifts than anybody in my department.
You're overburdened. That's why I asked Dr. Lewis to pitch in.
How? Covering meetings, overseeing teaching in your absence.
Which is what Chief Resident does.
Carter's not an Attending.
Dr. Lewis is.
- Why are you doing this? - I'm feeling unappreciated here.
- I'm trying to lighten your load. - No, you're not.
You're jerking my chain.
- Why would I do that?
- Because you can. Well, for the time being, consider Dr. Lewis your unofficial assistant.
No, I don't need any help!
And try to keep the public displays of affection to a minimum. This is a workplace, not a parade.
- I have messages for you, Dr. Weaver.
So you're gay, huh?
Yeah, Frank.
I'm gay, all right? You know you're going to hell, right?
- An entire bottle of wine?
- Topped off with a couple of Xanax.
Was she embarrassed?
Kind of hard not to be when you're puking your guts out.
- Know what the worst part about it was?
- You had to put her to bed?
It was a 40-year-old bottle of Bordeaux!
Is this a new thing?
She's been taking them for years. Really?
Mortality reviews.
It seems you get to finish them for me.
- I guess.
- They're due by day's end. - Great.
- Should I have some soup sent over?
- Is Elizabeth still sick?
- Yeah.
Listen, if you change your mind, call me, okay?
And hang in there.
Love you.
She's been on the toilet all night.
I'm not sure, but that may be more than I need to know.
So Romano conned you into picking up the slack, huh?
Oh, God! I agreed to help. Was that stupid?
A little bit around the edges.
Kerry's lucky to have you.
I don't think she sees it that way.
She's never liked me.
She doesn't like anyone.
- Don't people work around here?
- Glutton for punishment, huh?
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Oh, hi.
Welcome back.
- Yeah. To you too.
- Thank you.
You're here.
I was hoping you'd come earlier.
- Why?
- I wanted to acquaint you with the new forms for the CPT codes.
I'll be fine.
Suit yourself.
Good for you, girl.
You still owe me $20 for Cleo's going-away present.
Suddenly I feel like I never left.
You lost your locker. Keep your stuff in here for the time being.
Wait. There's dirt in here.
It's doughnut sprinkles.
Donald Brower, 35. Face, neck and chest injuries from some sort of explosion.
Unknown LOC, GCS 14 hypotensive, 80 palp, pulse 130.
Mr. Brower, can you hear me?
- Can you tell me what happened?
- Sorry?
- ... exploded.
- What happened?
- He opened some kind of letter bomb.
- Daughter's in that rig.
- Give it to me.
Jessica Brower, 6.
Near amputation of right hand.
BP is 100/70, pulse 120.
- Estimated blood loss?
- Three hundred cc's. Couple of litres at wrist, controlled with the cuff.
I'm Dr. Lewis. We're gonna take care of you, all right?
- It hurts!
- Yeah, I know it does, sweetheart.
- How's the airway?
- He's talking now.
- GCS 14 here.
- BP, 80/40.
Sir, can you see out of this eye?
- I'll get it.
- What-?
Peaked iris, probable globe rupture.
Follow the light.
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
He needs a chest tube.
- Betadine and chest tube tray.
- This is her birthday.
- Whose birthday, Mr. Brower?
- I let Jessica pull on the bow.
Do you know why someone would send you a bomb?
- My wife.
- Your wife?
- Mr. Brower?
- Sinus tach at 120.
- Is that chest tube in yet?
- That's the pleura.
- Open your eyes, Mr. Brower.
- Pressure's dropping, 70 systolic.
- He's out.
Vascular clamp.
- Another thoracostomy tray.
I've got it, Kerry.
I wonder how Susan's doing over there with the kid.
Okay, I'll put in the second chest tube and you get the airway.
Airway's fine.
- Gram of Ancef, IV piggyback.
- Where are we?
Superficial flash burns, face is fine.
Lungs are clear, pelvis is stable.
- All the money's on the hand.
- Pressure's steady at 100/70.
No visible deformity to shoulder or elbow.
Hold on. We need to take a look at your hand, all right?
- Thumb's intact.
- First HemoCue's eight.
Ring and little finger are missing.
We need Hand Surgery, Ortho, Plastics.
- Let the cuff down.
- Surgery'll be here in a minute.
I said take the cuff down.
Okay, Jessica.
Okay, sweetheart.
You just relax.
- Just need to know the exact injury.
- Well, now you know.
- You want hemostats?
- Yeah.
Just direct pressure.
Blood supply intact. Probably salvageable.
We're okay here, Kerry.
Sinus at 100.
CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine, coags and-
We already ordered pre-op labs.
- Fine.
- Two more of morphine.
- Let's get an x-ray tech down here.
- Carter, your mom's here.
Brought a kid from her leukemia center.
I got it. Yeah?
They come in on a rig? No.
She brought him in herself.
He has weakness and a slight fever.
Thanks.
And she's nicer than I remembered.
Oh, John. Thank goodness you're here today.
- Who's your friend?
- Mickey is the center's Child of the Year.
We were photographing him for the spring mailer. And he suddenly became lightheaded and warm.
So you brought him here?
We tried phoning his doctors, but it's Saturday. Is there someplace else I should have taken him?
- Did they give him anything yet?
- Your friend gave him some Tylenol.
- How long has he had leukemia?
- I'm not sure. He's been in remission a year.
Call his parents?
- He's an orphan.
- So he lives in a foster home?
With three other special-needs children. And foster parents he barely knows.
Hey, Mickey, how you doing?
- Not so good.
- Yeah? We're gonna see if we can figure out a way to make you feel better.
- Okay.
- A private room would help.
Swing your legs up there for me.
Unit six going up.
Pressure, 90/50.
AC 12 on 100 percent. Tidal volume 500, PEEP of five.
- You holding up okay?
- Yeah. - Fluid in Morrison's pouch.
- You can't let Kerry get to you.
And in the left pericolic gutter.
Where is Surgery? - Like riding a bicycle.
- Yeah, one with square wheels.
- Ectopy!
- V-tach!
Charge the paddles, open a thoracotomy tray.
Get ready. There's no pulse.
He'll be fine.
Charge to 200.
- Charge to 300.
- Ten blade. Clear.
- Asystole.
- Go ahead.
Open the chest.
- A-positive is up.
BP's 100/60. - TKO the other fluids.
- Bring another dose of fent.
- Jessica? - Are you her mother?
- Yeah. She's stable. She's had extensive damage to her hand.
- We need to get her to O.R.
- Can you hear me? We've given her pain medication.
She may not respond. - It's Mommy.
- Why don't you come to Pre-op. The surgeon will need to talk to you.
Where's my husband?
He's in there.
They're working on him.
Mrs. Brower?
- P.E.A.
- Don? - V-fib.
- Oh, God!
Shock him.
You the wife?
Your husband's injuries caused his heart to stop beating.
- We're trying to bring him back.
- A thoracotomy.
- Charge again.
- You a doctor? - Researcher.
- Clear.
- Still V-fib.
- Witnessed arrest.
- Charge again.
- Ten percent chance. Clear.
- I told him not to worry.
- Still V-fib.
- Charge again. - I told him it was safe.
Clear.
Agonal rhythm.
He's been down for 30 minutes.
You can stop.
He's gone.
- Are you being treated for your diabetes?
- Look, I'm blind.
I'm not stupid.
I do okay.
It's not easy to get someone to measure my insulin. But that's life.
Look, you know, I'm just here for the toenails, right? Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
You know, they're getting worse all week.
I think it was the new shoes.
When did you have them clipped?
- Oh, April maybe.
- They're pretty overgrown. You think it's hard to get someone to give you a sugar shot just try asking them to clip these puppies.
Well, you know, I can do that for you. Of course you can.
You're a gifted doctor.
Or at least you will be. Hold on.
Someone smells beautiful.
Bless you. - Hi, I'm Dr. Chen.
- I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, good things.
And the bad things aren't really your fault. - Excuse me?
- Manny has a sixth sense about people.
- Or so he says.
- Well, with my eyes I had to get something out of the deal.
What is this?
It's Mr. Kindlevich's Seeing Eye dog.
- Well, where's his harness?
- He isn't official. But trust me.
He's my eyes. I need him. All right.
Just keep him on a leash, a short one.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr. Chen, can I speak with you privately?
What do you want?
You know, eventually this has to stop.
This attitude, this resentment you have towards me. - Does it?
- We have to work together. I can't allow patient care... to be compromised because you dislike me.
- I wouldn't let that happen. - Good.
Because the last thing I need is a divisive medical staff.
Then maybe you should quit.
The police want to talk to you.
I told them to wait until after your daughter's surgery.
- Has it started? - Yes.
I should have told him about the threats.
We're trying to create stem cells.
Using embryos?
DNA.
Cloning.
This was meant for me, not him. Not Jessica.
Could I observe the surgery?
- It's probably not a good idea.
- I'm a doctor.
You're also a mother.
I'll see what I can do.
- Easy, kid. Easy.
- Almost there.
- Sorry about that.
- Damn medical students!
He's all bark.
You know, you remind him of his son.
I'm black, sir.
I can't see.
Did you want two sets of cultures?
- My best friend Eddie has the flu. - Yeah.
There's a lot of that going around.
- We were shooting outside. - It's freezing.
I tried to tell the photographer.
Abby is gonna draw some of your blood.
- I have a good vein here.
- Okay.
Take a deep breath.
Exhale.
You don't have to watch.
I'm fine.
Just a couple more vials and we'll be all done.
- Where are you going?
- I have other patients.
You want to play with it?
- Hi!
- Are you feeling any better?
Hardly.
- Is she keeping you busy? - Yeah.
I tried to get her down for a nap earlier, but she wouldn't do it.
Sometimes stroking her earlobes helps lull her to sleep.
Can I get you anything to eat?
Oh, Rachel, I don't think I can keep anything down.
How about some tea?
Sure. Sure.
Hello, sweetie pie.
Careful. You don't want to get her sick.
Okay. Why did I wear these shoes?
- Because you forgot that around here-
- Comfort first.
- Yes. - No, I didn't forget. It's just I'm not ready to go back to ugly, sensible shoes.
I heard that you did some really nice work in that trauma today.
Doesn't count if they don't make it.
Why did you treat pyelo with Bactrim?
Because the PMD sent a culture two days ago. I have the sensitivities.
There's been resistance to Bactrim.
Not for her.
Well, if you don't have a culture, you start with Levaquin or an aminoglycoside.
- Hey, looks like you made a friend.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, knock it off.
- Gallant, get this dog out of here.
- Thanks a lot.
- This is a hospital, not a kennel.
- What'd I do?
Tried to let her off the hook.
Whose side are you on?
I'm not on anybody's side.
I'm trying to play this very neutral.
No. You have to be on someone's side. It better be mine.
- Deb, she's my boss.
- You like her, don't you?
I don't dislike her.
- That makes a lot of sense.
- What makes a lot of sense?
- Oh, your taste.
- Excuse me?
John, it's obvious. You have a thing for older women.
- What?
Weaver, Lewis and, oh, that pediatric surgeon. What was her name?
- Oh, come on!
- Come on.
Younger women just too much for you?
I can handle myself either way.
- Yeah, sure you can.
- Your mom's asking for you.
- What do you want to tell her?
- Where's my kid?
- I'm with a patient.
- What'd you do with my kid?
- How's the leg? - Much better.
- What you got?
- Leslie, unrestrained driver.
Slow-speed MVA.
Drove her car into some bushes. Found her and daughter on the curb. Only injury's a scalp lac.
- Where's the daughter?
- Behind us.
- Hey, Leslie.
I'm Dr. Carter. - Oh, I just bet you are, sweet face.
BP, 130/80, no LOC. And enough alcohol...
- ...on her breath to start a fire.
- Hey, I resent...
- Hi. What's your name?
- Stacy Miller.
Thirteen years old. No LOC. Says she wasn't hurt.
We're gonna check you out, ...make sure you're okay.
- You feeling pain anywhere?
- Yeah, a big one.
You guys a bunch of frigging perverts or something?
In my ass.
Excuse me?
- That looks pretty superficial. - What?
The cut on your head.
There's a cut on my head?
I'm sorry.
I'm just kidding. You know-
- Softer hands, honey.
- I'm sorry. But I ain't "honey."
Why is everybody so serious around here?
A pretty serious thing happened to you.
No, no, no.
See, this is a bump.
What's seriously wrong is what's in here.
You having chest pain?
I have a broken heart.
Two great weeks, and he leaves me without a word.
What the hell kind of fiancé is that?
Trauma panel, urine tox and a dip.
B.A.L. and hang a banana bag.
- Suture kit?
- I'll get it.
"Banana bag"?
- Is that the daughter?
- Yeah.
Lucky me, huh?
Stacy, we need to get you into a gown so I can examine your chest and belly.
I said I wasn't hurt.
You want to get out of here, right?
Go home, clean the house. Get your homework done.
- How did you know?
- I'm very smart.
Besides, the quicker you get into this, the quicker you get out.
At least you were being responsible.
Mom says seat belts are too confining.
Nice example to set, driving drunk and beltless.
She wasn't driving.
I was. - You're 13.
- Almost 14.
- You don't have a driver's license.
- Neither does my mom.
She still drives.
I just take over when she's had too much to drink.
You been doing this for a while now?
Three years.
Not one accident.
Till now.
Okay. We'll be right back. We just need to get some more supplies.
That is completely nuts.
Or brilliant, depending on your point of view.
A 13-year-old driving her lush mom is good?
No. But neither is a lush mom driving her 13-year-old around.
Somebody's gotta be the adult.
Everything was going along fine...
Elizabeth, you awake?
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
She's sweaty. - And she just started crying.
- Let me see.
Let me see. - Did you give her milk?
- No. Just mashed bananas.
Here, just take her a moment.
I'll just get the thermometer.
Oh, sweetie. How long's she been crying?
Elizabeth, she just threw up.
Oh, dear.
- Oh, come here, sweetie.
- Maybe she caught what you have.
Oh, it's okay.
- What's this?
- What?
- Get the phone.
- What is it? It's a pill fragment. She swallowed something.
Oh, my God! Her heart's pounding.
Rachel!
It's okay, sweetie pie.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right, darling.
- It's all right, darling.
Answer, damn it!
- Oh, my God! It's okay.
- It's E.
- What?
It's Ecstasy. I had some in my backpack.
911.
Yes, sorry.
No, hold on. Hold on.
- How many?
- What? - How many pills are missing?
- Just one or two.
Yeah, sorry. I have a baby with an amphetamine overdose.
- What's your address?
- Yes. 1211 Dupont Drive.
Please hurry.
It's all right. It's all right.
DUI's a pretty serious offense.
Yeah, but letting her sober daughter drive was worse? I don't know if it's worse.
It's child endangerment. You gotta get Social Services involved.
Stacy goes into foster care?
That may not be such a bad thing.
So you want to call the cops, or should I?
Abby, we need to find Dr. Greene.
- I'll take care of it.
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
I got a little busy there. Has his fever broke?
No.
And he's very uncomfortable.
- No one's given him anything to eat.
- I'll make sure he gets something.
I talked to the Pedes Oncology fellow. He's gonna come see him.
- Aren't you going to do something? - Yeah.
I sent off his labs.
No, I mean in terms of treating him.
There's no obvious infection. The oncologist can take it from here.
It may be a while, if you want to go home. I can't leave.
His foster parents still can't get here?
No.
Somebody from the center can relieve you.
I'm from the center.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
I mean, stay involved?
Do you think she'll remember him?
When my daughter was 6 she broke her arm in two places riding her bike.
And the only thing she remembers from that year is seeing Muppets on Ice.
They remember the good things.
She won't forget her father.
- Mrs. Brower. - Yes?
I'm Dr. Romano.
I finished my part of the surgery, which went well.
Will they need to amputate?
She's a doctor.
There's stable bone on the remaining digits blood supply and enough skin to cover grafts. So she'll have use of the hand.
Limited use.
But kids can adapt.
Corday and the paramedics are on their way with your daughter.
Came over the MICN as an Ecstasy overdose.
- Did they say how much Rachel took?
- All I know is, she's vomiting.
- Is she awake? - They didn't say.
- Who didn't say?
- I didn't take the call. Haleh did.
- What are her vitals? - I'm sorry.
I don't know anything.
I knew she was doing this.
I knew it.
I should have trusted my instincts.
I gotta take the stairs.
Move!
- Sorry.
I got the charcoal!
We need a Pedes ICU bed!
- Where are they? - Trauma 1.
Move! Move!
Move!
How's her airway?
She's breathing on her own, tachy at 180 and febrile.
- Oh, God! - She's diaphoretic.
- Let's get a rectal temp.
- What the hell happened?
- She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy. - What?
I'm not sure how.
She's sympathomimetic toxidrome.
And we couldn't get a line in the rig.
- Where was it? - What?
It was in her backpack!
She had four pills. Two have disappeared.
And Ella vomited a fragment of one.
Bolus 100 of IV saline.
Ten milligrams of charcoal by NG.
- Prep a milligram of Ativan. - They blew two veins in the field.
- I'm gonna try an interosseous.
She's got a good antecubital!
- Oh, God! - Heart rate's 250.
Looks like a narrow-complex SVT.
Dr. Corday, what is her weight?
Ten kilograms at the pediatrician's last week.
Okay, here we go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
- Twenty-four gauge in right AC. - Push the adenosine.
Lungs are wet.
She's in failure.
We need to break tachycardia!
The CHF is rate-related!
Could somebody get me a stool, please?
- Still in SVT. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Worry about my daughter!
- We're gonna need the crash cart. - What?
- She's hypoxic with pulmonary edema in SVT.
The protocol is to synch cardiovert at half a joule per kilo. No!
No, we're not shocking her.
She's hemodynamically stable.
Maybe we should get Dr. Weaver in here. No.
Let's try two of adenosine.
Abby, get Dr. Weaver.
Mr. Kindlevich, you still being treated? No, discharged.
Just waiting for the van to pick us up.
- Stinky!
- Why don't you have a seat? Here we go.
Just step straight back. There you go.
- He never leaves.
- Well, I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Stinky!
Stinky?
Is that you?
He needed to take care of business.
Gallant, you're a student, not a dog walker.
- Bless you.
- I think I'm allergic to dogs.
Apparently.
Next time use a plastic bag. Dr. Weaver!
They need you in Trauma 1. Dr. Greene's daughter's in trouble.
- Second round's onboard.
- Stats down to 90.
Put her up to 50 litres of O-2.
- Still in SVT? - Yes.
- Have-?
- Push 3 adenosine.
Mark, we both know how difficult it can be working on a family member.
- Okay, get ready with diltiazem.
- And your own child in particular.
- I got it, Kerry. - No.
- No, you need to step aside.
- I said I've got it, Kerry.
Calcium channel blockers can cause cardiovascular collapse and death in kids under 1.
Mark.
- Push one milligram of Inderal.
- You're soaking wet. - Please.
- Your pulse's thready.
You have a fever.
It's just gastroenteritis.
- Sinus rhythm.
- Thank God!
- Number 8 French NG for the charcoal.
- Let's get Elizabeth to bed.
- And run in two litres of saline.
- I'm not leaving!
If you don't, you're gonna pass out. That won't help anyone, least of all Ella.
She's okay. She's stable now, okay?
Go lie down.
- I want to be able to see her.
- I'll set you up in Exam 2.
- Damn it!
- Pulse ox is down to 88.
Lungs are full of fluid. Fifteen of Lasix.
- Think about intubation.
- I can get her out of failure.
- She's retracting.
Give the diuretics a chance to work.
Put her in the Broselow tape. Bag her on 100 percent. - No.
You'll hyper-inflate the stomach!
- Mark, your baby is hypoxic.
You want to avoid unnecessary procedures. But if we don't intubate, you're making a big mistake.
- Now, step aside.
- Rate- The failure was rate-related.
We broke the SVT.
But now she's in pulmonary edema.
If this wasn't your baby, we would have intubated her a long time ago.
I'm trying to save her life.
Pre-medicate with. 2 of atropine, 15 of lidocaine.
Induce with 3.2 of etomidate and paralyze with 22 of sux.
- What size tube? -4.0 uncuffed.
- A number-one straight blade.
- Call for a Pedes vent.
Tidal volume of 100 cc's.
- We should be doing something. - There's nothing we can do.
They got three doctors.
I think we'd just be in the way. - Yeah.
Did you hear how it happened?
- Yeah.
It is amazing the drugs that kids can get ahold of.
Oh, my God! Is that Rachel?
Mickey's been upstairs an hour. He hasn't been seen by a doctor.
Yeah.
That's not uncommon.
Well, it's unacceptable.
I was gonna get coffee. You want some?
Yes. I'd love some.
I was hoping you could tell me what all this means.
- You stole his lab slips?
- Yes.
I heard that they were back but no one gave us the results.
What is it?
He's in blast crisis.
He's had a recurrence.
His bone marrow's full of leukemia cells. He's not gonna be able to fight infection.
- Is there something we can do?
- I'm sure they're giving him antibiotics.
The oncologist will know exactly what to do.
Yes, of course. But he's just a number to them.
Maybe if you spoke to the doctors, they'd take him more personally.
Why are you doing this?
You've been here all day. You've been holding his hand, clipping his chart, bugging the staff.
- I'm trying to help a sick child.
- Mom, he has leukemia.
- I know that.
- And he may not survive.
If you've got some kind of twisted need to relive this, that's fine.
I'm not gonna do it again.
I made my peace a long time ago.
Let's pull the tube back five millimeters.
- Are you in the main stem?
- At the carina.
You should be in bed.
Heart rate's down to 100. Pulse ox is 99.
When can we extubate?
They'll probably keep her sedated in the PICU rest her overnight in the vent and extubate her first thing in the morning.
Mark, we need them to get a rollaway in the room.
- I'm staying the night.
- Elizabeth, you're sick.
- Well, you're not leaving, are you?
- No.
- I found her wandering the hallway.
- Dad?
Rachel, where have you been?
I was just waiting outside. Is she okay?
Does she look okay?
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
- Mark?
- Stay out of this.
You bring drugs into our house and leave them out for a baby?
- It wasn't mine.
- Stop lying!
They were for a party.
I wasn't sure I was gonna take them.
Your sister did.
But she's gonna be okay, right?
It was one pill.
Are you really that stupid?
- Ella is 9 months old!
- I know.
- She almost died.
- Dad, don't-
Don't what?
What? Don't call you a liar?
Because that's what you are!
You promised you weren't doing drugs!
I'm sorry.
She could have brain damage learning disabilities, low IQ, memory impairment.
- She could still die!
- I know, Dad!
Please, please, Dad. I'm sorry! Dad, I'm-
Daddy, I'm sorry.
- She still seems a little warm. - We'll get a repeat temp.
She can have ibuprofen by NG.
I'll check the orders. Is this the overdose?
Do we have a post-intubation film?
I want someone else.
Let's see how she's satting on 70 percent. No, no, no.
You're not touching her. - What's the problem?
- Page me another doctor.
- There's no one else on service.
- If we're going to control toxicity...
- ... we need to wean down the oxygen. - Yes. Well, I want my own pediatrician.
- Is this your daughter?
- You are not touching her!
I have to.
I'm the Critical Care Attending.
No! No!
You do not touch my child!
Do you hear me? - You stay away from her!
- Lizzie!
- We have to check the blood gas!
- Get out!
You heard what she said.
Out!
Get Dr. Rosato in here.
Kerry? Yeah.
How's she doing? Vitals are stable.
Satting well on 50 percent.
- Sounds like her lungs are drying up.
- Yeah, we've got a long ways to go.
My prayers are with you all.
Kerry thank you.
- Taking off? - Yep.
If I hang around here much longer, I'm gonna start to cry.
- Is your mom still upstairs? - Don't know.
Don't care?
Hi.
- Hey, I thought you left.
- I wanted to say thanks.
The officer said that they'd book her for the DUI but that I could post bail in a couple hours. Wait.
They're charging your mother with the DUI?
And I made an appointment at that treatment center. - Great.
- But you were driving.
- No, I wasn't.
- I thought you said she was driving.
- No, I didn't.
- What?
Anyway, I gotta catch a bus.
Good luck.
You said you were gonna call the police.
You said I was gonna call.
I asked, "Will you take care of this?"
She's her mother's best chance for recovery. I think you know that.
- Good night, Carter. - Good night.
Hey, Gallant.
Your guy's dead.
Rachel's here.
Did you call the police?
She wants to talk to you.
I can't.
- Elizabeth- - I'm sorry, Mark.
I can't.
Let's get you something to eat, okay?
I want to stop by. But they probably want to be by themselves. You want to go in on dinner for them?
Have it sent over so they don't have to leave? Yeah.
That'd be nice.
- Bye, Kerry. - Bye.
- Good night, Dr. Weaver. - Good night.
Stinky!
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to catch him. He's running in circles.
And he comes back here.
I think he knows Animal Control's coming.
Oh, for God's sake! Go inside and take an antihistamine.
Yes, ma'am.
Come here.
I don't like dogs.
And I don't like your name.
Give me a break.
All right, come on.
You better be housebroken.
Because if you're not, you're going right back to the pound.
- Who is it? - Abby, it's me.
Let me in.
- Joyce?
- Please hurry.
What's wrong? - Joyce?
- Turn out the lights.
- Turn out all the lights.
- Well, what's going on? - I'm sorry.
I had to get out.
I hope it's okay that I came here. Well, of course it is.
But
- Joyce?
Joyce, you in there?
No, no, no, no. Don't go.
He's probably just looking anyplace he can think of.
Open up, damn it!
- I'm calling the police. - No.
It'll just make it worse.
- He just needs to calm down. - Joyce, you in there?
Joyce, we can't hide in here all night.
He'll go away.
- When?
- Open up, damn it!
Bitch!
I think he's gone.
Can I stay here for a while?
Sure.
She's pretty tired.
How you feeling?
- Kind of better. - Yeah?
They treating you okay up here?
They don't tell me much.
They tell her mostly.
You know what's happening to you, Mickey?
I know it's back.
But I don't think it'll be as bad this time.
I was by myself before.
She looks asleep.
But she's not.
Hey, you want me to...? You want me to take over for a while?
She is gonna come out of this.
Well, she may not.
She may never open her eyes again.
Elizabeth.
I don't understand why this has happened.
It'll be okay.
Mark, you don't know that, do you?
No. No.
We'll be back with the news on the hour after this 30-minute music mix. You realize you've been in there for 20 minutes?
You miss me or am I wasting water?
Both.
How much longer are you gonna be?
Your shift doesn't start for two hours.
Yeah. There's an 8:00 meeting near here.
You gonna go?
I was thinking about it.
Hello?
Something wrong?
Carter? What are you doing?
We really can't help you anymore, sir.
I'm not a junkie.
The stuff just finds me, you know?
How convenient.
I need another room for Mr. Hudlin.
He says Exam 3 is full of ectoplasm.
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- What?
Never mind.
Lipstick.
- Dr. Carter...
- Mrs. Breeland, you need to stay in bed. Otherwise, we might be tempted to put somebody else in it.
Okay, I think we're getting there.
Hardly.
Board number two is for the patients in the halls.
We have heat exhaustion, barbecue-smoke inhalation, and boils. All up for grabs.
- I love my job.
- No, you don't.
Why are you dressed like that if you can't prescribe nothing?
The smell of fresh med students in the morning.
What is it about them? They all seem so...
- Gullible?
Immature?
Vapid?
- I was going to say sweet.
Bee sting in 1 is asking for you.
Have them start the orientation manuals.
I'll be with them soon.
- Carter, MVA, two minutes.
- But not to hold their breath.
Dr. Carter, so there's a trauma coming in.
Yeah. Why don't you take the bee sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4 and the burning rash in 2? Care to give me a hand?
- Help me!
- Why not?
- Help me!
- Hey! That's just been mopped, damn it!
You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
- Remember that for next time.
- Come on, man!
- Think it's always this crazy here?
- Probably.
They need to bring you back to the VA hospital, sir.
- I don't understand.
- Your driver will explain.
You guys suck, you know that?
- Don't bother. We don't have any beds.
- So, what else is new?
- No, I'm serious. Try Mercy.
- They' re refusing patients too.
- I've been bounced all over town with this guy.
I'm out of gas and so is he.
If I don't get him into a bed his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
I got to make water!
Yo, doc!
- You are one sadistic bitch.
- Now give me your middle finger.
I would if I could.
Any emergency meetings get scheduled?
Just one, about this spate of ER closures in the area.
I've advised the board that preliminary figures show an increase in our patient load by 34 percent.
- Who'd you take to La Scala's?
- Sorry?
Which board member's ass are you kissing?
- Now the ring finger.
- Robert, I simply compiled a report.
- Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
- I'm not kissing ass.
It's not my dominant hand.
In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities out of necessity.
I'll be in my office in two weeks...
- ... and back in the OR in two months.
- I hope you are.
Thought about upping your Vicodin?
Ibuprofen.
I want to stay clear-headed.
- That's enough for today.
- No, keep going.
Sorry, have another patient.
Don't get comfortable, Kerry.
- Is there anything else?
- Just your continued support.
Lizzy.
- Elizabeth, how are you doing?
- Fine.
Good.
Well, we'll catch up downstairs.
- I heard rumors.
- All true, I'm afraid.
The one face I missed seeing in Recovery.
I'm so sorry, Robert.
What, about my arm or about not being there?
- How are you healing?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
You?
Any sensory function yet?
Nope.
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go. I'm sorry.
- Dr. Corday. How was London?
- Good.
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had.
- So I hear.
- How's Ella?
- Fine.
- Is it nice to be back?
I'm off to the ER. I'll let you know.
Okay.
Well, good luck.
- Bite me, panty smellers!
- Ma'am, you need to calm down!
Die, you sucking pervert!
Dr. Corday, hi.
We need some Haldol here!
- You think that's necessary?
- Yes!
Doctor C, looking good.
Thanks, Malik.
So, what's the GCS on this motorcycle trauma?
- Sorry, I didn't do the ride.
- Oh. Well, have the X-ray tech...
- ... come down for portables.
- You got it.
- Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
- Hey, welcome back.
Thanks.
So do you know any of the specifics?
Sixteen-year-old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole, no helmet.
Carter's bringing her in.
- What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
- What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?
Have the rapid infuser primed and ready, draw her up 100 of fent four of Ativan.
Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
- It's like you never left.
- Yeah.
Vital sign.
- We need some O-neg.
- She got a rhythm?
- P. E.A. to agonal before arrival.
- Decreased breath sounds.
Intubated for agonal resps. Didn't know you were back.
- When did she lose her pulse?
- Never had one.
- Everybody.
On my count.
One-
- Hold transfer and compressions!
- Asystole!
- Abdomen's distended.
Pelvic instability.
Suction on high.
I need a Yankauer.
That's easily two liters.
All right, amp of epi.
Don't bother.
Obvious C-spine fracture.
She's not even a good organ donor now.
- Is her family here?
- Trying to locate them.
- We can talk to them...
- It's fine.
Just let me know when they arrive.
...if it'd be easier for you.
I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to. Because it's all right here.
Welcome back, Elizabeth.
Do you have time for a consult?
As it turns out, yes.
What's he have?
Belly pain?
Only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.
No sudden moves unless you want me to blow!
Milo has right upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.
I'm a human time bomb.
He needs to be cleared before we move him upstairs.
- I could go off.
- He could get hypotensive.
Are you scared?
I'd be scared.
No!
Give him two liters of saline...
- ... and monitor him for a few hours.
- Thank you.
Gallant hasn't turfed a case to Psych all day.
- You wanted the consult.
- Dr. Lewis.
- Yeah? - We' re to capacity?
Every bed, every day since Mission Hospital closed.
I thought it was just St. Paul's.
No. It doesn't help Weaver's been gone so much.
- She's gunning for Romano's job.
- It keeps her very busy.
- Dr. Lewis.
- Mr. Sprooner.
Guess you're still itchy?
Yeah. But there's-
You need to give drugs a chance to work and quit scratching.
I think the guy next to me stopped breathing.
Great!
Got a gang shootout here.
Couple DOA's at the scene.
Another rig's coming behind me.
- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100.
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he? Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
Hang in there, Alma. We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter. Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea. You talk to them.
So. Newbies, huh?
You don't wanna work here.
- Haleh, get that dead body out of here.
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!
We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us.
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- How about your legs?
- No. I can't feel them.
Gallant, need a hand here.
We' re talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?
I'm on Psych rotation.
I really shouldn't be helping you.
- Haleh, this is a dead body.
- You ought to go to med school.
Can't take her to the morgue yet. We' re waiting on family.
Why am I not exploding?
No movement below the umbilicus.
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?
You might have bruising to your spinal cord.
I need 30 mgs per kilo of methylprednisolone, IV bolus.
- Where the hell's X-ray?
- Behind you.
Start with the chest.
- Please. I need Ricky.
- Stay with us, Alma.
Entry wound, left mid-sternocleidomastoid with a large hematoma.
There's blood behind the ear as well.
Be nice to hear about that ultrasound.
Morrison's is dry. The pericolic gutters look good.
- Bladder is-
- Shooting.
Wait!
Wait.
She's pregnant.
- What?
- Looks like about 11 weeks.
Fetal heart rate is 140.
Baby appears healthy and intact.
I need Ricky.
It's my arm, man.
It hurts like a...
Do something already!
BP's steady at 120.
But he's been like this the whole time.
Ricky, you need to calm down.
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds.
Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis.
He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps.
You were lucky.
Yeah? You should see the other guys.
No fracture or deformity.
So, what? Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead?
- An eye for an eye, man. - Yeah.
Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
- Where you going, dog?
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
- I'm gonna kill those bitches!
You already did!
Repeat hemogram and update tetanus.
Keep your hand there and don't take it off until you get upstairs.
- Dr. Corday, when you have a chance?
- Be right there.
Make sure the blood bank sends type-specific straight to the OR.
Have the anesthesiologist call me with any questions.
- Are you the one...?
- A neurosurgeon will perform it.
He'll talk with you shortly.
- I'm sorry?
- Don't let me die.
You' re one cold-hearted bitch, you know that?
I don't have any damn pity for you, whore!
I'm talking to you, pissface!
Don't you dare turn your back on me, you stuck-up little ass-shaker!
Where the hell do you think you' re going? !
Pardon me. Coming through.
Watch your back, sweetie. Excuse me.
- Doc, I'm gonna miss the season-
- Keep your cup on.
I should have been off two hours ago. You still here?
Can't leave till my patient gets a bed.
Them's the rules.
- Don't sound upset about it.
- Up to level 12.
Turn that off, disturbs the patients.
- Frank, what'd I miss?
- County HHS needs to talk to you.
- Ditto, Human Resources.
- Anything from Dr. Romano?
He called half an hour ago, an hour before that.
Somebody from Dr. Rydell's office called to confirm your appointment-
Frank, 2 needs a janitor.
What the hell is this?
Why is Stella Willits still on the board?
I called to have her admitted to Psych hours ago.
- I haven't evaluated her yet.
- Save yourself the trouble.
She's nuts.
She's a frequent flyer with a history of bogus medical complaints.
With all due respect, I'd like to determine that myself.
The ER doesn't have time or manpower to deal with hypochondriacs. That's what you' re for.
Get her off my board.
- It's part-
- I said, get rid of her.
Stubborn. Gotta give you that.
- How are those medical students coming?
- Fine. I gave them three volumes of Rosen.
ER. Carter, Urology on two.
Think you can come up with something a bit more interactive?
Yeah. Sam Polivy's back with a ureteral stone.
P-O-L-I-V-Y.
Abby? Those labs back on Melinda Harrell?
- Let me check.
- Hi, I'm Erin Harkins.
- I'm on the phone.
- You're busy. We get it.
Can we get an approximate time orientation will begin?
Doctor?
Don't tell me you're keeping med students waiting.
- Check with Pratt.
- I'm checking with you.
- Intractable pain and hydronephrosis.
- Dr. Carter?
I cannot admit him to Eight West.
There are no beds.
I'm Dr. Weaver, Chief of Emergency Medicine.
I will give you a brief tour of the ambulance bay, after which our Chief Resident will give you his attention.
Because, as you'll learn, it's his primary responsibility. Come on.
- Sorry. What was that?
- Demolition-site accident downtown.
- At least a dozen injuries.
- ETA?
- Now.
- I gotta call you back.
Paramedics can transport using standing field protocols-
- We've got multiples.
- Wait here.
- Who's on first?
- Sick one.
Frank Chambers.
Forty years old, severe chest trauma when a walkway fell.
Wrecking-ball crane collapsed.
BP, 80 systolic, but headed the wrong way.
Tachy 120, denies LOC.
Crepitus on right side.
Page Surgery.
- Mr. Chambers, can you talk?
- Hurts too much.
He thought his ribs were broken.
- You are?
- His secretary.
Sustained a facial lac and chest pain but refused treatment.
- You need to be examined.
He's decreased on the left.
- Let's hear it.
- I've heard it since Michigan Avenue.
Ken Ambrose, 34, tib-fib fracture with dislocation.
F. D. had to lift a flower shop off his leg.
Not a shop. It's a kiosk!
- Abdomen's soft, non-tender.
- Vitals normal, tachy at 120 with a liter in.
- Gave him ten of MS. - Don't touch!
It hurts!
Okay, bear with us.
We'll give you something.
- Oh, God! I see a light.
- You're not dying. It's just your ankle.
Oh, God!
- You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me! - Haleh?
Where's the trauma?
Throw a rock, honey.
Blunt chest in 2.
You look wonderful, by the way.
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.
You cut your hair?
- BP's falling, 70 systolic.
- Keep squeezing that bag.
- Where are we?
- Flail and crepitus.
Needs a tube.
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here.
How can I help?
Given there's only one, I don't see how you can.
- What is that?
What are you doing? - It's a tube to help him breathe.
He has a collapsed lung, this will re-inflate it.
I need a thoracostomy tray.
All right, let's see how much air he's got in here.
Oh, God!
That any better, Mr. Chambers?
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes. With his wife. She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac. Come with me.
- No. Somebody needs to be with him.
- Okay, I'm in.
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
Lewis, what are you doing up there?
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
Lungs clear, chest tones normal.
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
- Explains no pulse.
Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven, dip a urine, chest and pelvis x-rays.
Chen, give me your hands.
- What are you doing?
- Hold tight.
Ken! Have you ever been to Hawaii before?
- Well, pretend that you' re there now.
- Pratt, wait!
I can't believe you!
I feel better.
I feel totally better!
I feel totally sick.
Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds?
No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
In other words, I just saved your foot.
Thank you.
You' re wonderful.
- Subclavian's in. Is that the film?
- Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.
- He's holding his pressure. - No pneumothorax.
Looks like a widened mediastinum and loss of the AP window.
Hard to tell. The pulmonary contusion is impressive.
One of us should go with him to CT.
Not unless you' re ready to crack the chest.
Flail chest, pulmonary contusions, and labile hypotension.
Could also be from a splenic fracture.
Carter, I'd like an aortagram. Better yet, a TEE.
The fact he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
- Page me with the result, okay?
- Elizabeth, I think there's more to discuss.
Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon.
The last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff.
Keep me apprised of his condition.
- Okay, the last one.
- Can I go see him now?
No. We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart or damage your lungs.
- They' re not doing anything.
- Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
I'm sure he's stable.
I told Mr. Chambers we were 10 minutes late.
It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
- You don't call him by his first name?
- He's kind of formal.
How long have you been working for him?
Two years.
Six days a week, 10 hours a day.
Probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
They' re really happy though.
I mean, she's lucky to have him.
- He's a good man.
- Luka no fragments in the x-ray.
Ready to irrigate?
Yeah.
Put Polysporin on the wound.
Where'd you get that one?
A lowlife stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
An inch to the left and you would have lost a kidney.
Guy that did it to me got snuffed with a sawed-off.
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
- Whatever, bitch.
- Hey, watch your mouth.
Are you almost done, man?
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma.
She's probably in Recovery by now.
- That means she's okay, then?
- No. She could wind up paralyzed.
- Like, all over or just her legs?
- They' re not sure yet.
Well, better if they just killed her, you know?
An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
Yeah, that was personal.
It was about my name, honor.
- But paralyzed? That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
- Piece of work, huh?
- Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
- Who?
- The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No. Do you?
Not really.
Hi.
I'm Michael Gallant from Psychiatry.
Stella Willits from Ohio.
Nice shiner.
I understand you have quite a few medical complaints.
- I'll need to ask you a few questions.
- Knock yourself out, hon.
Had any recent weight gain?
I've been thinking about going on the Zone.
- How about dry skin?
- Like the Sahara. Here.
Give me this.
"Intolerance to cold." Yes. "Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation." Yes, yes, and yes.
" Fatigue. " Well, I have been kind of low-energy lately.
You have some delayed relaxation from the deep-tendon reflexes.
What about depression?
- Me? - Yeah.
No, I'm glass-half-full, I'm silver-lining girl.
Listen, I'll be back to finish.
I guess I do get a little blue sometimes.
Get this gurney out of the way.
If you haven't talked to anyone, you need to go back to the nurse in Triage.
Your food poisoning in Exam 4's been here for 11 hours-
- Waiting on a consult.
- From the Naked Chef?
He ate bad shrimp.
- Can I get something for my skin?
- Yeah, sun block.
Can I talk about Stella Willits?
- If you' re admitting her to Psych.
- She may have a reason-
Just got word on Mr. Chambers.
Aortic dissection.
I'm taking him up to Surgery now... - ... unless you have objections. - No.
Would it be possible for us to speak in private first?
- Of course.
- Dr. Weaver?
- Later.
- Yeah, but I need...
I wanted to talk to you about what happened earlier.
Oh, for God's sake!
Who left a cadaver in here?
Sasha's a bit of a bad penny.
She keeps being moved while they try to locate her family.
I don't mind if you don't mind.
I'm concerned that you might be taking on too much too soon particularly in the area of trauma.
Based on?
What I saw earlier.
A pronounced inability to work with others. A lack of professional respect.
You' re joking, right?
Look, it's stressful, no question.
Copping an attitude with me and my staff is not gonna make a trauma go any easier.
Kerry, I saw a dissected aorta.
In fact, it only adds to the intense pressure that we' re all feeling.
Given my position, I didn't think it necessary to seek your approval.
We all have our sensitivities.
Quite frankly, if anyone has an attitude here, it's you.
- But we can't let them interfere- - No!
It's you, with your insistence on being kowtowed to at every bloody opportunity!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
I want some milk, I'm thirsty.
His landlord found him in his apartment crying, hyperventilating.
- Apparently, his girlfriend left him.
- The term would be " mommy. "
- What?
- Mommy.
Well, he appears to be an Aby.
You know, an adult baby?
It's a fetish in which the baby is taken care of in every way by a " mommy" or a "daddy. "
You're familiar with this condition?
It's not really a condition. It's more like a form of relaxation.
- Are you kidding me?
- No, it says right here:
"Abies like to relinquish control, get away from their stressful lives. "
- Mr. Dwyer, what do you do for a living?
- Shoe sales.
A foot fetish too. This is an issue for the Psych Department. No offense.
I am not so sure about that.
Mr. Dwyer, when's the last time someone changed you?
This morning.
More than likely, he suffers from a diaper rash, which is a medical ailment to be treated by the ER.
- When are you done with this rotation?
- Next week.
Remind me to give you some serious scut work.
"To Dr. Pratt, thanks from a grateful patient.
Ken, the kiosk man. "
Amazing.
Too bad this guy didn't run a hot-dog stand.
I'm here for allergies.
These things are pushing me over the edge.
Can you get rid of them?
Or give them to someone a little more deserving.
Who saved flower boy's foot and moved more patients than anybody today?
Me, that's who.
You' re gonna miss me too, because I'm out of here.
- Banker's hours, Pratt?
- Only if they work doubles.
Hey, Carter. What's up with your boss?
Is it true she was crying earlier?
- Weaver?
- Yeah. Bad breakup or something?
- Been pretty moody lately.
- Lately?
I'm sorry! I think this man needs immediate attention!
- You gotta help my pops!
- What happened?
They came in the ambulance entrance.
- I saw he was diaphoretic.
- Not asking you.
We were playing ball. He grabbed his chest.
- When did the pain start?
- An hour ago.
- Thought it would go away!
- You have pain anywhere else?
- Scale of 1-10, how's your pain?
- Forty.
- How you feel?
- Talk to the elephant on my chest.
- It could-
- Excuse me. You mind?
- What are your names?
- I'm Pete and he's Derek.
Can you take Pete and Derek to the TV room. One, Pratt!
Okay, here. Come on.
Is there any way that we can wait in the doctors' lounge?
As soon as you' re a doctor.
- Tombstones in two, three and F.
- Better with the spray under your tongue?
No. What do you mean by "tombstones? "
It's a non-medical way of describing the line tracings on an EKG.
It's not good news, Mr. Royston.
It looks like you' re having a heart attack.
- Aspirin?
- Already gave him 80.
Push five of Metoprolol, titrate morphine, start heparin and nitro drips.
- Call Cards and cath lab.
- What's going on? What's he gonna do?
There's a blocked vessel.
We open it with a balloon to stop your attack.
We need your permission. It's called angioplasty.
- Sign for me.
- Cath lab will be ready in 30 minutes.
- He's a hot MI.
- They' re finishing a pacer.
While they' re messing around, he's killing heart cells.
- It'll give us time to medicate.
- V-tach.
- Like I said.
- Charge paddles to 200.
- No pulse.
Starting compressions.
- Abby, open an intubation tray.
Let's get Cardiology in here!
And, clear.
The doctors there will give you antibiotics.
Make sure to get that wound checked in two days.
- Right.
- So he's good to go?
- Later, I guess.
- She's pregnant.
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.
I told you, man, she's not my girlfriend!
Well, whoever she is to you, she's carrying your baby.
- Why don't you care?
- Why do you?
Three-sixty again.
Clear.
- Still fib.
- Resuming compressions.
- Is this my consult?
- Acute inferior Ml.
Refractory V-fib despite lidocaine and procainamide.
Want to go TNK?
Isn't gonna make it to the cath lab.
I've been pounding on him. He'll bleed out with thrombolytics.
- Who's talking?
- Pratt, first-year Resident.
Then shut up.
CPR as a contra-indication to thrombolytics has been debunked. It's a myth.
- Forty of Tenecteplase, IV push.
- Charging to 360, and clear.
A boatload from Lake Michigan just came with alcohol poisoning.
- Kids?
- Worse.
Parents.
The 10-year-old was the only one sober enough to dock.
Do you think it's too late to go into Dermatology?
- Excuse me, doctor?
- Yes?
I had a message that said my daughter was in a motorcycle accident.
Her name is Sasha, Sasha Huffner.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll check on her for you.
- Thanks.
- Wait right there.
- Susan, did you order a urine tox screen-?
- Check my orders.
Elizabeth?
- This guy with the ringworm, he's-
- Can you hang on a second?
Elizabeth.
And an abdominal CT with contrast and two grams of cefotetan.
- Can we talk?
- I'm on my way to the OR... - ...with a bowel obstruction, if it can wait.
- Sasha Huffner's father's here.
- Your first patient, the DOA.
- Right, right.
Look, if you want, I can tell him for you.
Why would I want that?
You' re on your way to surgery.
- It's depressing.
- What's his name?
- Paul. He's standing over-
- I'll find him.
Hold compressions.
- Fine V-fib.
- Resuming compressions.
How long has it been?
Forty-two minutes.
Okay, that's it.
Call it. You can stop now.
Time of death is 7: 11.
- Wife here?
- She's on her way.
- You should still wait.
- Can't lie to them now.
Want to turn off that monitor?
- Whoa! He's in V-tach.
- What?
I can shock that.
They pronounced him.
Yeah, well, now he's got a good rhythm.
Two hundred. Clear.
Yeah. Still V-tach. That's enough, Pratt.
- Bag him. Do it!
- No! He's dead!
Three hundred.
Oh, my God.
Sinus tach.
I said, bag him.
We did everything that we could.
We had three doctors working on him for over an hour.
We gave him medicine and we shocked his heart, but it didn't do any good.
- Why not?
- Because his heart was very, very sick.
And it was too sick to save.
I shouldn't have made him play ball.
- I mean, he said he was tired. - No, no.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault. Your dad had a problem nobody knew about.
Not you, not your mom, and not even him.
You gave him the best possible chance he had by getting him to the hospital.
He can't be dead.
I'm sorry, Pete, he is dead.
And it's very sad.
And it's very unexpected.
And it's okay to cry.
It's just a sign of how much you loved your dad.
Do you guys want to see him?
You can say goodbye?
Yeah.
Okay.
You need to know your dad's gonna have a lot of tubes attached to him.
And it might be a little scary.
- It's okay. - Ready?
Keep the lidocaine at two milligrams per minute and page the CCU team.
- What are you doing?
- I got him back.
What the hell's going on?
BP's 90 palp.
He's back.
- He's alive?
- He's not dead.
Daddy's alive!
- Mr. Huffner?
I'm Dr. Corday.
I'm a surgeon here at County and I was your daughter's physician this morning.
Did you operate on her?
Is she all right?
I mean, where is she?
Can I see her?
I'm afraid your daughter died this morning.
She came in essentially DOA with massive internal injuries from a motorcycle accident.
My God.
Someone can take you to see the body.
We've kept it in the department for your benefit.
And afterwards you can make arrangements with the morgue.
A nurse can give you information about grief counseling.
She's my little baby.
Is she gone?
I'm sorry.
Nobody walks out of a hospital after 40 minutes of CPR.
There was improvement. From V-fib to V-tach.
He's either dead or should be dead.
Which means your Resident is cruel, stupid, or both!
He saw a shockable rhythm in the setting of thrombolytics.
It could take 30 minutes for TNK to open the coronary artery.
- Are you defending this?
- He made a split-second decision. He was acting in the interest of his patient.
Well, he was wrong.
And now we have a vegetable with a pulse on our hands.
Well, our names are on the chart, not yours.
Dr. Pratt and I will take full responsibility for any negative outcome.
Oh, you bet your ass you will.
Hey, I just want to say thanks for backing me up like that.
A Chief Resident and a cardiologist with more than 25 years of experience pronounce a man dead.
And you decide to resurrect him.
- Yes. But just like you said-
- Think I defended you because I like you?
Or I approve of the way you practice medicine?
You are my responsibility.
You are my job.
And I'm doing mine.
If you wanted to shock, you could have paged me. I could have been here in a second and we could have discussed it.
Instead, you go off!
Without regard for authority or the best interest of your patient.
Now, that's not true.
The guy's got kids. He's got a wife.
I was trying to save him-
You brought the man back, Pratt, because you felt like it!
Because you wanted to see if you could.
Why's he still sleeping?
He didn't get enough oxygen to the brain.
So we have to wait and see if he wakes up.
You know, there's a chance he might not.
Why's that?
He's just taking a nap is all.
Pete, your dad's still pretty sick.
Yeah.
But you saved his life.
Hey, you guys hungry?
Come on. Let's go down to the cafeteria. I'll get you something to eat.
All right?
I'll take you where the doctors eat.
My daddy doesn't like doctors, but I bet he'd like you.
You tired?
There's gotta be a better word for it.
Enervated, asthenic, atonic?
- Pooped?
- Bingo.
Does that mean you want to stay home tonight?
Not necessarily.
Anything particular come to mind?
You keep working that spot, I'll do whatever you want.
You know, I do need my sock drawer organized.
Can you help me?
They told me my husband was back here.
He had a heart attack.
Mrs. Royston?
Even though we got his heart beating again the neurologic tests showed that there's a lack of basic brain function.
- What that means is that-
- I know what it means.
How long can he last like this?
Indefinitely.
Did your husband leave any instructions?
Did he ever express his wishes about what should be done in a situation like this?
He's 42 years old.
Then I need to ask you, if his heart stops beating again do you want heroic measures taken to save his life?
Or do you want to sign a Do Not Resuscitate order?
Is that the right thing to do?
I can't make that decision for you.
Is it the right thing to do?
Yes.
- I want to thank you, Dr. Gallant.
- There's no need, Mrs. Teasley. No need.
I just get, I don't know, panicky in public places.
You know, that's why you need to keep taking your Klonopin.
- Well, I hope I wasn't too much trouble.
- Oh, not at all. Not at all.
Gallant.
You want to explain why Stella's still here?
- I'm waiting on some lab work.
- Who said you could order labs?
- No one. I thought-
- You' re here to assess psychiatric problems, not do a medical workup.
I realize that. I think she is really sick.
- You looking for these?
- What?
- Her TSH level is over a hundred.
- Stella?
Well, she's hypothyroid, which explains all of her symptoms. Depression, fatigue-
But not the fact that she's a con artist and a hypochondriac.
Until your rotation is over, you are not a member of this ER.
Stop doing our work, start doing the work of your current department.
- Yes, ma'am.
- But good catch.
You off soon?
In a few minutes, yeah.
Do me a favor. Discharge Stella before you leave.
I feel like crap. I'm going home.
Yeah. We sent the labs out this morning.
- She's been here for 24 hours-
- Something's wrong with my dad!
Hey, Pratt!
Can you get in here?
Mama, what's wrong?
Mrs. Royston, did you sign the DNR?
You gotta help my dad.
He's in arrest.
Mrs. Royston, did you sign the DNR?
What's a DNR?
It means that your dad is too sick for us to try to help him.
- Why can't she?
- Because he's already gone, baby.
No, he's not! No, he's not. He saved him.
- He said he was gonna be okay.
- Derek, we tried.
- Why are you letting him die?
- Baby, please...
You gotta help.
Mama, tell them to do something, please.
Why are you doing this?
Asystole.
Why?
Daddy?
Rominger's not an appy.
Twenty-five, male, periumbilical to the lower right quadrant. He's a poster boy.
You can bring him back in 12 hours.
Oh, Dr. Lewis asked that you take a look at the cholecystitis.
Page the next shift.
- Do you want to take a call from Neuro?
- If it's urgent.
You forgot to sign off.
So how are you feeling?
It's about the GSW you handled earlier.
Alma Salazar.
I'm fine.
- You wanted to know her status.
- What is it?
You gonna tell me?
She's a quad.
Hi.
Oh. You' re not gonna wake him up?
- No.
- Didn't you two come in together?
Yeah. I'm sure he can find his way home without me.
- You need a lift then?
- No, thanks.
Have a good night.
Oh, man.
Oh, man! I don't know. This is the craziest movie!
Hey, yo.
What's all this?
Pay-per-view. Want some pizza?
- Yo, Biz. Let me talk to you for a minute.
- Yo, I'm watching a movie, man.
If I gotta come there, I'm gonna smack fire at you.
Come here, man! Let me talk to you for a minute.
Come on, man! Hurry up!
Come here, man.
What's your problem?
I thought I told you, man, don't come here again!
Stay away from him!
You understand that?
- Yo, I'm saying, now you his mama, yo?
- What? Yo, man, chill out!
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Why you tripping?
Don't play with me, man.
All right, that's it! The party's over!
Everybody out!
Come on, man, get up!
You, too, get up! All y'all!
Get up and get out!
Yo, my man, are you stupid?
- Come on. Come on.
- What you doing, G?
Get out. Close the door behind you.
What's wrong, G?
Yo, I'll holler at y'all later?
All right.
- Those are my friends, G!
- Yeah? Well, this is my house.
It's mine too.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, what? You pay rent? Come on.
No.
Does that mean I can't have no friends?
Just be quiet. I'm tired.
Yeah. You tired, all right.
Grouchy too.
You know those guys are just using you, right?
Yo, dog.
How they blow up a whole town like that without killing anybody?
They don't.
And if you shot the gun that close, he'd blow his eardrums out too.
Yo, G. It's just a movie, man.
You ain't got to take it so seriously.
Yeah, whatever.
But she's hot, though.
Most definitely.
You right about that, G. Yo, you still want some pizza?
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
- How long have I been in there?
- Since before my shift started.
Is Abby here?
Nope.
But she left you a Post-it.
And you still have a med student waiting for you.
Look, I'm sorry. The day just kind of got away from me.
- Why don't we try again tomorrow? - No.
No, I don't think so. No.
I have been here for 16 hours. I have been ignored and yelled at, and called " honey, " and "sweetie, " and " bitch" twice.
I don't smell good.
And all I've had to eat is gummi bears and Diet Coke.
I'm not leaving until I get what I came for.
This is the Admit area.
This is the center of the ER universe, where you pick up your patients' charts order labs, spend the bulk of your life for the next three months.
- How do you know who's next?
- You check that chart rack.
We see people in the order they arrive unless the nurse feels they' re of high acuity.
- Then they' re moved ahead.
- Do you get to suture?
If you' re supervised by an Attending...
It's Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.
Whiskey, Yankee, Charlie, Zulu, Echo, November, Sierra, Kilo, India.
- Wyczenski.
- Could you tell me his squadron number?
Hold on.
Do you know his squadron number?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
You don't have a central directory?
Johnny's up. He pulled out his Hep-Lock.
Get Conni. I'm off.
No, no.
I'm calling on behalf of a family member.
Okay.
Then can you transfer me to the confinement facility?
- Stop staring!
- They don't talk to family members.
- I'm not gonna lie.
- I just wanna know where he is!
- Stop staring!
- She offered her cat a teaspoon of acid.
- Get away, freak-o.
- Sine equals cosine-
Hello?
Lieutenant Michael Gallant, U.S. Army Reserve.
- What are you doing?
- Are you deaf?
I said, get away!
- Stop it. - He won't stop staring.
- He's not hurting anybody.
- He smells like piss, man.
- This way. This way.
- Keep the mental cases locked up.
- It's irrational, but it has a fraction-
- He's not at Great Lakes.
- I kept trying to call you.
- Couldn't get a phone signal on the base.
- Sit down.
- It's a rule. It's a constant.
But they did keep Eric there on Thursday night.
- They told you that?
- They held Eric there three nights ago...
- ...then transferred the next morning.
- Transferred him where?
Nebraska, his base.
Might as well be Manila.
There's, like, 100 offices on that base.
Is that Army or Air Force?
I was desperate. I thought he could use military lingo or something.
Great, thanks.
Okay. So they gave me the number to the 55th Wing Judge Advocate's Office.
I left five voice mails there. They' re closed all weekend.
Did you get the name of his attorney?
- I can call back.
- That's okay.
Thanks.
I'm just gonna go there. I'm just gonna go there.
Why don't I call the travel agent, see if we can book a flight out for tomorrow.
- I wanna go tonight.
- Confirm he's there.
I've been trying to confirm where he is for three and a half days.
- Is there a flight out tonight?
- Yep. United, 9:30 to Omaha.
My shift just started five minutes ago.
I can't dump it now.
- You don't have to come.
- You can't go by yourself.
- I usually do this by myself.
- Let me find Chen to cover for me.
She left five minutes ago.
Do you even know how to get onto a military base?
- There must be a visitor's center.
- You have to have a sponsor.
- I'll figure it out.
- At least take Gallant with you.
- That's what I need, a med student.
- To us, he's a med student.
- To them, he's an officer.
- He has things to do.
He's been on a base before. He speaks the lingo.
Can you call me a cab, please?
Maybe some T-shirts.
They' re in the third drawer on the right from the bottom.
Just pick out anything that doesn't look like I slept in it.
What about toiletries? Toothbrush, toothpaste?
I'll just buy that stuff when I get out there.
And socks and underwear in the second drawer.
Pull them from the top.
- Why?
- Because those are my respectable-
Oh, right, and...
- Were they open?
- Yeah. Just made it.
- What?
- Dry cleaner.
- My uniform.
- Thought it might help.
- You don't have to do this, Gallant.
- Never been to Omaha.
What's that?
Internal medicine exam next week.
Oh, that's great.
You coerced a med student into failing his rotation.
I'm on a 10:00 flight.
I get in at 11:30.
- Call me if you need anything.
- When are you gonna sleep?
Just get in the cab.
Thank you.
I'll see you in Nebraska.
Okay, Frank, what do we got?
Let's see.
Four-F with abdominal pain in Exam 3.
five hundred and 10, equals 284.
Jacob gave Esau 220 goats and 220 sheep.
Come on, Johnny.
Let's see if we can't get you something to eat.
Come on, foot.
Come on. Come on.
You say delayed, but you mean canceled.
- No, sir...
- Well, how long does that usually take?
- Go ahead.
- Can you give me any estimate?
- Go ahead.
I got it. - I could be here a while. Go ahead.
Well, have they even started to plow the runways yet?
No task on the agenda has priority over the number 200.
Sum of the main diagonal should be equal to the sum of each row.
Now, that's tricky, but it's part of the magic.
Must be equal.
Must be all.
Sum of the major diagonal should be equal to each row and each column.
Now, that's more tricky, but it can be done if you know the secret.
Sum of three numbers geometrically equidistant from the center...
- You okay?
- Yeah. It's just worse when I wake up.
At least you got some sleep.
- Hey, did it stop snowing? - Yeah.
But don't expect to go anywhere.
- I got another 12 hours anyway.
- At least they'll be quiet.
- Hello?
- John.
Hey. Hang on.
- Hey, where are you?
- Looking for Eric's commanding officer.
- You got on the base.
- Yeah.
You were right.
Gallant's a fast talker.
I'm looking at one of those stealth plane things right now.
- You see the news?
- What?
- I said, did you see the news last night?
- No. What happened?
Three feet of snow dumped in seven hours.
Carter, I can't hear you.
Three feet of snow dumped in seven hours last night.
The airport's closed.
I'm at work.
I can't get my car out of the parking garage.
El's shut down.
The El.
Forget it.
Is he there?
Eric.
Is he there?
I don't know.
Nobody seems to know anything, actually.
I thought the military was supposed to excel in communications.
They had trouble giving direction on where to park much less...
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Carter?
No, no. Not you.
- What?
- Off the phone!
You' re a civilian in a restricted area.
Get off the phone.
- I'll call back.
- Tell her to get off the phone.
Talk to you later.
Your office issued a visitor's pass and suggested we look for you in Hangar 12.
That, lieutenant, is Hangar 13.
- "Oh," what?
- Oh, sir.
- Sir.
- You're Wyczenski's sister?
- Yes.
- Funny guy.
Popular too.
Unfortunately, he didn't feel much responsibility to the Air Force.
Is he here?
Because nobody's telling us anything.
Ma'am, I just came off of a 72-hour live-fire exercise short one air-traffic controller.
- If Sgt. Wyczenski was apprehended-
- Aren't you his commanding officer?
If he was picked up in Chicago, he would be brought here.
Go to your hotel. Leave your number with my office.
He's suffering from a psychiatric disorder.
I'm well aware of the "near-miss" depression.
Bipolar disease. Manic depression.
He needs to see a psychiatrist.
He needs to be evaluated and medicated now.
So wherever he is, wherever you seem to have lost him, he needs help.
- snow day for all city offices and school...
- Did you hear that?
- Closed.
City offices.
Read the sign. We' re county.
They haven't plowed the bay.
They' re having trouble getting on the road.
Chuny, Lydia wants to know, since you' re stuck here, if you'll take her shift.
Tell her to break out the shovel.
Hey, repeat troponin's negative on 5.
Send him home with a sled and some Huskies.
- It is so quiet. - I know.
Kind of freaky, huh?
- So you trying to rent a snowmobile?
- Considering it.
- Do they deliver?
- I can't get them to answer the phone.
Rack is empty, Triage is clear and labs are pending on my only two patients.
- Good.
- So, what do I do now?
I don't know.
Go play in the snow.
Hey, Ella!
Please tell me daycare's open.
There's a kindergarten teacher in Exam 4.
My nanny couldn't get out of her front door.
- That's what windows are for.
- I'm soaked to my knees.
- All we did was walk from the El.
- The El's open?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- We're outside.
- On an Air Force base.
- Do you need clearance to smoke too?
You can't talk on a cell phone. You can't smoke.
You see that truck?
- Yeah.
- That's jet fuel.
- Amy Lockhart?
- Abby.
Lieutenant Ottenson, your brother's detailed counsel.
- Has he been charged with something?
- No. Not officially.
- Acting combative or argumentative?
- I don't know.
- Delusional?
- I haven't seen him.
I just got the jacket.
Can I go in there?
I really need to talk to him.
- He's not here.
The judge advocate-
- Wait a minute!
Wait! His CO said that they took him to confinement Friday afternoon.
And transferred to base hospital Saturday morning.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- I thought you were Malik.
- Do I look like Malik?
Sorry, man. You ain't that good-looking.
- What are you doing?
- You told me to play in the snow.
You can't let him outflank you like that.
Yeah, right.
- Commuting on skis.
- What?
- You' re skiing to work.
- Yeah. I don't live far.
- Nice coat.
- Goodwill box.
- Hey, did you find him?
- Who?
Abby's brother.
I'm gonna catch a train to Midway and wait for it to open up.
- Where are you going?
- Nebraska.
She's already there.
She left last night.
- You didn't go with her?
- I had a shift.
- I sent Gallant with her.
- Gallant?
- Yeah.
Why?
- Carter, we've got multiples coming in.
- Luka's here.
- Three criticals. One adult, two kids.
Some drunk plowed through a family making a snowman in their front yard.
- Where's Weaver?
- She can't get her car out.
The El's running.
It's hard walking through the snow with a cane.
She's disabled, remember?
I thought we were closed to ambulance traffic. How's anybody gonna get in?
We'll do a hot unload.
Stay with me.
Approach the helicopter from the front.
It'll be windy as hell up there.
If anything blows away, don't chase it.
- It's far too easy to become disoriented.
- Right.
- You need some help?
- I've got it.
Your stethoscope will be useless.
So will your ears, for that matter.
Rely on your other senses.
Look for chest excursion, feel the pulses, study the monitor.
Pulse ox, ECG, dynamap.
They'll tell you all you need to know about the status.
Don't even try to take a history until-
You have a tremor on the left.
That's the Sinemet.
It works faster when I chew it.
I've only noticed it on the right.
Have you had symptoms on the left before?
- Stress, you know. Sleep deprivation.
- Or a progression of your disease.
My rotation's almost over.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Working these insane hours when you-
Please don't treat me like I'm dying, okay?
Can we just go get this patient?
Keep your head down.
Stick with me and stay clear of the tail rotor.
- They gave him a drug called "Depacot."
- Depakote.
- And Zy-
- Zyprexa.
Apparently, he's coherent.
He's scheduled to go up against a Rule 706 sanity board at 1200.
- "Up against"?
- It's just a formality.
- If he was psychotic- - " Manic, " actually, is the term.
Then they won't court martial.
They'd process him on medical discharge.
How long will they hold him?
If he's mentally stable, they'll release him.
No one calls me to get a family history or gives me time to set up treatment for him?
You'll just boot him out?
If he'd asked for family, someone would have contacted you.
- He's not thinking clearly.
- Abby.
The doctor's in with him now.
- Name?
- Mother's screaming for Toby and Matt.
- I don't know which is who.
- Toby. The other one's Matt.
Cushing's response.
Vital signs negative.
No hemotympanum.
Pupils blown.
Seven mm bilaterally non-reactive.
No corneal or gag reflex.
His brain is mush.
- Tell me the drunk driver died on impact.
- It was one of those monster trucks.
- He hit the whole family?
- Dad was getting a carrot for the nose.
- CT's ready.
- Scan the belly along with the head.
- I need to get to the other one.
- Epidural hematoma?
- If we' re lucky.
- Set me up for a central line.
- Pulse ox is only 85.
- Is that the mother?
- C-spine is clear.
- Jumped in front. Truck hit straight on.
- Does your belly hurt, ma'am?
- Chest.
Flail segment.
Thirty-two French.
Please.
My boys.
Please, save my boys.
Full trauma panel.
Type and cross for 4, portable chest and pelvis.
Another unit on the second line.
Let's set up for a femoral.
- We have blood?
- We'd better.
He's got contusions and crepitus over the left chest.
- They left my mom.
- No, they didn't.
- They left her in the snow.
- Follow this light with your eyes.
- She's here.
We' re helping her.
- Where's Toby?
He's here too.
Decreased on both sides. Bilateral thoracostomy.
- Ten blade.
- Times two.
Pressure's holding, but he's tachy.
All his ribs are shattered.
He should be dead.
He would be, if his mother hadn't jumped in front of him.
Have you talked to him?
Just briefly on the phone.
It's happening Mom.
It's happening to him.
He showed up in Chicago with this girl that he had just met and I knew he didn't have that much leave, but I
I just felt it right away.
I should have called you.
I'm sorry.
But I didn't know what to do. Then the MPs came and arrested him.
- Actually, I got him arrested.
- Abby, don't start. This is not your fault.
No. I needed to know.
I had to know, so I called here and I got his medical records and they had misdiagnosed a depression in May.
They thought it was stress, which is why he was transferred here.
We thought it was situational.
What?
I made him see Dr. McMangus.
You knew about his depression?
McMangus is a mood-disorder specialist.
Even he thought it was PTSD.
PTSD?
Mom, you' re bipolar.
Insomnia, loss of appetite, inability to concentrate.
It was all specific to the event and resolved without medication.
Do you even know anything about your disease?
Yes, Abby. I know a lot about it.
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.
Protect me?
What about protecting him?
Your brother didn't want you to know.
- Can't get a pressure.
- No femoral pulse.
Check a Doppler.
V- fib.
Crash cart. Thoracotomy tray and prep the chest.
- It's blunt trauma.
- She had a pulse and was talking.
Ten blade.
Get FFP from the blood bank and page Cardiothoracic.
If they can get here.
- The husband wants to come in.
- No!
Rib spreader.
- Metz and pickups.
- Nathan.
Sir, you've gotta come with me. Sir?
- No pericardial infusion. - Oh, God.
- No cardiac lacerations.
- Satinsky. Nathan, now.
- You've got to come outside with me. - No.
- Starting compressions.
- I'm her husband.
She is bleeding into her chest.
They are trying to save her.
- The aorta is cross-clamped at 10: 27.
- Heart's empty.
- Empty?
- Please, please.
Blood must be in the right chest.
Get me another tube.
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Dr. Corday.
- Swab stick.
Suction on high.
- Boy's not oxygenating at 100 percent.
Carter thinks a rib punctured his heart.
- Squeeze in four units, then defibrillate.
-3-0 nylon and OpSite.
- What happened?
- Rib lacerated his LAD.
He's got a huge V-Q mismatch, low PO-2 and diminished lung compliance.
Troponin is 32. CK, 925 with 20 percent MB.
He's having a massive Ml.
- Cath lab first?
- Probably heart muscle damage.
Okay. Let's call Cards and set up for a Swan.
- Carter, Abby on 2.
- Get a number, see if I can call her back.
- Ectopy.
- You can't repair the coronary artery?
- It would just be feeding a dead heart.
- Another run. Ten beats.
Okay. Okay, call a perfusionist.
We' re gonna put him on bypass.
- Bypass?
- Just do it!
Susan.
- Susan!
- Neurosurg is on the way.
- All they can offer is ICP monitoring.
- No subdural?
Diffuse cerebral edema with intraparenchymal bleeding.
Complete effacement of ventricles.
Knocked out the brainstem.
Get a stat EEG and mobilize transplant service.
- Transplant?
- Toby?
Is that Toby?
I'm Dr. Corday. I need a word with you.
- Aren't you working on my wife?
- I'm working on your family.
How bad is he hurt?
He wasn't talking.
There's a massive swelling of his brain.
He's in a coma?
No. He's brain-dead, I'm afraid.
- Brain-dead?
- I'm sorry.
- We still can't get a rhythm.
- Be right there.
-1500 cc's out the right side.
- Susan, can you help Luka?
- Get him in the Suture Room.
- This is sudden.
But your other son, Matt, his heart is failing.
The artery that feeds it was severed by his rib.
His lungs are bruised and filled with blood.
His only chance is a heart and lung transplant within the next six hours.
Do you understand?
School was canceled and the street was blocked and the boys wanted to make snowmen.
Sir, do you understand?
I need your permission to take Toby's heart and lungs and give them to Matt.
- What?
- This son is dead.
I might have a chance to save your other one.
- No, you just save them both.
- I can't.
- Elizabeth, you need to open a chest.
- Kids are resilient.
- He'll bounce back, right?
- Elizabeth, I might need you.
- Not now.
- Drunken driver with distracting injuries.
No!
Look, I know this is difficult, but I need your consent now.
You can't just wait a couple days?
See if he wakes up?
Elizabeth.
Sir, I'll be right back.
Nathan.
You need to calm him down, explain it to him, get consent.
He's not in the state of mind to understand.
So you make him understand.
We just have one shot at his other boy.
What, they' re worried about national security?
It's protocol.
Military's big on it.
They already said they'd discharge him.
How long can it take to talk to a lawyer?
I guess he needed to brief him on the hearing.
There's a PX.
You want something to eat?
No, thanks.
You haven't eaten anything since last night.
I'm fine.
- Mrs. Wyczenski?
- She's fine too.
Look, Gallant, you came here to help me get on base, and I got on base.
Thank you. Now you should go.
- I mean, I can stay.
- You have a test.
- But Dr. Carter said if I did need-
- I don't care. Dr. Carter's not here.
And besides, this is my family.
You should go.
- Well, there's only one car.
- Mom, do you have a rent-a-car?
- Yes.
- You can take it.
- Come on, go. Go.
- I'm gonna take him over in 45 minutes.
- Can I go in now?
- He asked to see his mom.
- Let's go.
- Only his mom.
- Does he know I'm here?
- Yes, ma'am.
And he doesn't wanna see me?
Not right now, ma'am.
I'll talk to him, Abby. He'll come around.
Right this way.
Spreader.
At least 2 more liters in the right chest.
- Suction.
- Vascular clamp.
- Looks like a hilar injury.
- Tore the pulmonary artery and vein.
- Got it.
- Resuming compressions.
- Is he getting consent?
- He's trying.
- HemoCue, 6. 2.
- Comes in handy, I guess.
- What?
- He's good at talking patients into stuff.
- Another eight of packed cells.
- She's in arrest too long.
- We only got hemostasis a minute ago.
- He's in V-tach!
- Four units on the rapid infuser.
- Thirty-five kilos.
Charge to 50.
- Where's my perfusionist?
- Still trying to get through the snow.
- .35 mg of one to 10,000 of epi.
- Sinus.
- Okay, bolus lidocaine and-
- V-tach. Pulseless.
- Starting CPR.
- All right, 120 again.
I got it.
- He consented?
- I showed him the EEG.
Everybody clear.
- All right, sinus.
He wants to convert.
- V-tach.
Heart's ischemic, lungs can't oxygenate.
Move to the OR.
We don't have a stable rhythm yet. Lidocaine, IV push and charge.
- You got a signature?
- He's signing now.
And clear.
- Sinus.
- Okay, then get his brother upstairs.
- Hold right there.
- We need that transplant team here now.
- Back to V-fib. - Damn it.
All right, charge again to 120.
Procainamide, 300 mg IV over the next half-hour.
- Charge again.
- Wait.
- Back to sinus.
- Okay, that's it. Let's go.
Lido infusion at 40 mics per kilo per minute.
- We shouldn't move him.
- We have a window.
He's in sinus now.
- For 10 seconds.
- We need to get him on bypass.
- He can't last that long.
- You wanna do a heart transplant?
You have any other ideas?
I'm here, kiddo.
It's not gonna hurt. I'm here.
We'll set up.
Have the bypass catheters standing by.
- Subclavian?
- No.
Femoral. Ten French.
- Ectopy again.
We gotta hustle.
- What's wrong?
- Hey, hold the elevator!
- Sats down to 78.
- He needs to be suctioned.
- You gotta make this work.
- We'll do our best.
- No, promise me.
- Promise me this will work.
- We have to get upstairs.
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.
Let's open up the dopamine box.
It's okay, baby.
You' re gonna help your brother, okay?
You' re gonna help your brother.
My wife.
If we bring him in to my wife, she's gotta say goodbye.
- Amp of bicarb in.
- I think I just broke his last rib.
Good pulse with compressions.
Where are we headed?
- OR 2.
- V-fib!
- Hold compressions.
Charge the paddles.
- Charging.
Clear.
- Battery's dead.
- Check the connection.
- Still energized.
- Okay, stop.
Clear!
There's a crash cart in the OR.
- Let's go. Grab the slider.
- One-fifty.
- Charged.
- Clear.
Sinus.
Three milligrams per kilo of heparin...
- ...then prep for THI cannula.
- One, two, three.
- Where's my transplant team?
- What do you want me to do?
- Keep him in V-fib.
- Heparin's in.
Waiting on gradient.
- Run a V-tach. Half-bolus of lidocaine.
- Two hundred units per kilo.
- Sinus.
- Then one per mil of prime.
- Shirley?
- Right here.
Meet the donor at the elevator.
Get him prepped next door.
- Repeat BP.
-100/60.
Ten blade.
Starting bypass at 11:46.
- Hey. - Just got him hooked up now?
LAD is shredded.
Irreversible ischemic damage to left ventricle.
And I thought I had a snow day.
Get the harvest team going.
Keep pH at 7.4.
PCO2 between 30 and 35.
He doesn't blame you. He just can't hide from you.
You saw him manic, and he hasn't accepted it yet.
He's taking the meds.
Not by choice.
That could take some time.
He's emotionally exhausted.
And he's ashamed.
Try not to be confrontational.
I've got this down. Thanks.
Were you expecting a straitjacket?
No.
You look nice.
Fashion's key at a court martial.
It's not really a court martial, right?
It's a Rule 70-
I know what it is, Abby.
You wanted out anyway, right?
Yeah. It's all a ploy.
You know I love you, right?
You know that.
I was worried about you because I love you.
- And you think I'm crazy?
- No, not crazy.
Oh, right.
Sick. Mentally unstable.
Suddenly plagued by a psychiatric illness.
Truth is I was having a pretty good time.
I want you to come back to Chicago with me.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Maybe you could call the MPs again.
Eric, you've seen this.
You know if you don't stay medicated, it can get bad. I mean, bad.
- You could end up wasting-
- Abby, she's right here.
I know she is.
It's not a secret.
She knows it.
She'll tell you.
She will tell you.
Mom, tell him.
Tell him, Mom!
Mom, tell him.
I'll be in the waiting room.
- What the hell, Abby?
- Yeah, what the hell?
You called her?
You didn't-? It took me three days to find you.
- I talked my way in here.
- I didn't ask you to.
But you called her? The most unreliable, undependable person in our lives?
- And you' re dependable.
- Yeah. To you, I am. Yes.
Then I'm sorry.
I have to apologize to poor Abby.
Poor, poor Abby.
My career is over, but she doesn't get to be the savior again.
You need help. Mom screwed up the first time you went to her.
One, I don't need help.
And two, I didn't go to her.
She thought she saw something.
She dragged me to her doctor.
I went to make her happy, and her doctor proved her wrong.
She wasn't wrong.
Then why am I not allowed to call her?
Better get going, sergeant.
Hey, make sure you check my knee too.
It's killing me. I hit it on the steering column.
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.
Then get me something for the pain, brother.
All the alcohol wasn't enough, brother?
- I only had one beer.
- This the driver?
Right-side tenderness.
The ultrasound looks clear.
Hey, what's your problem, man?
You got Tourette's or something?
- Did you do it?
- Ask me in six hours.
The transplant team's working.
- Did you talk to the father?
- Large seat-belt contusion.
- Safety first.
- They let you be a doctor like this?
Only on the patients they don't care about.
Hey, did you just dis me, man?
I think he just dissed me.
Do you know what you did?
- Do you have any idea?
- Yeah. I banged up my knee.
You killed a whole family! A mother, her two kids!
- No. I hit a snowman.
- They were making a snowman, you jerk!
Perhaps you should help out with another patient.
You have to give him time, Abby.
Oh, now you speak?
Now you have an opinion?
He can't feel we' re ganging up on him.
- Just don't push him.
- I didn't push him.
You were already talking about going back to Chicago.
They are discharging him, Mother.
Where do you suggest we put him up, in a psychiatric hospital in Omaha?
I'm not so sure he should be hospitalized.
Well, that's not really your decision.
Is it yours?
You know, he only looks normal because he's on Depakote.
- And if you had seen him-
- I know the pathology, sweetie.
And, yes, the easy thing would probably be to try to commit him.
Easy?
But he's got to accept the disease, accommodate it.
And until he does, he needs to be supervised or he will go off his meds.
You always did.
Well, he probably will at one time or another.
But, Abby, trust me on this. It's like AA.
It's got to be his decision.
He's got to want it.
And it's way too early for that.
Mom I have been living with this disease my entire life. Please don't lecture me on it.
I know you've been living with this your entire life...
- ...but you've never been inside it.
- What is that?
What is that? "Inside it"?
Like you two have some sort of special bond now?
- Because you' re both inside of it?
- Abby, stop it.
This is about Eric.
You can't go back to the way you two were.
There's no quick fix.
Your brother will be struggling with this for the rest of his life.
- Has she been vomiting?
- Twice this morning.
She started to run a fever so I brought her in.
Is anybody else sick at home?
Her little brother had an earache a couple days ago, but he seems fine.
- Let's take a look.
- God knows where they've been.
Well, you can't take my blood alcohol.
I don't give you permission.
We don't need your permission.
- So you hungry at all, Kiley?
- No.
- Any diarrhea, Mom?
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?
It was an accident.
I scared her more than anything else.
- Are you all right?
- Did you hit the TM?
He just jammed that thing in her ear.
- I don't think I really hurt her.
- Well, why is she crying?
- Here.
- Where you going?
- I'm going home.
- Come back here and finish the workup.
No, thank you.
We were able to get Matt stabilized on bypass.
The transplant team's at work.
Is there anybody you'd like me to call?
When will you know?
It's a delicate procedure, especially on children.
There's a waiting room on the third floor.
I can't seem to walk out of this room.
What time is it?
It's almost 5.
I'd be getting home about now.
Silvia would probably pick up a pizza or some Chinese because she got busy with the boys after school and didn't have time to cook.
Toby would have a picture that he drew that he'd want me to look at.
And Matt would want me to test him on his math.
You made the right decision.
The only one you could.
We woke up this morning everything was white.
They were so happy.
We all got to stay home.
It may not seem like it but I know what you' re feeling.
- I understand what you' re feeling.
- I'm sorry, doctor, but you...
You don't know what I'm feeling.
You don't have any idea.
I don't even know.
My husband his name was Mark.
My God, I was about to say last year. It was only six months ago.
I tried to pretend once Mark was gone, that I could pull myself up, continue like normal.
But it doesn't work like that.
You see, you can't run away from it.
It's like this big, relentless wave that you have to ride.
But in riding it, somehow you hold on to what you've lost.
And you find a way to go on without shutting off.
It's not easy, but you do it.
I know someday soon when you look into your child's eyes all you will see are the beautiful things that live on in him.
He needs to be okay.
I need him to be okay.
He will be.
He will be.
Based on his testimony, they don't have enough information to conclude...
- ...that he was mentally incompetent.
- Why is he here?
- He's demanding due process.
- He needs to stay medicated.
I'll contact the convening authority to get him released from pre-trial confinement.
The door doesn't open from the inside.
Pick up the phone when you' re finished.
- You requested a court martial? - No.
- That's what the lawyer says-
- I was gone less than 30 days.
The worst they'll do is discharge me, maybe a couple weeks' confinement.
You don't have a couple of weeks.
I haven't hurt anyone.
I haven't broken any laws. I haven't acted irresponsibly.
- I just needed a change.
- You went AWOL.
That's between me and them.
They want me to say I'm crazy.
I won't say it.
- Nobody's saying you' re crazy.
- You are.
- No, I'm not.
- Come on, Abby. You were there.
You even tried to hide it from me.
Mom was crazy.
She was out-of-her-mind crazy.
And I'm not like that!
I'm not her.
You can say it all you want.
I'm not her.
Shirley, she said she saw you out here on her break almost an hour ago.
You okay?
No symptoms.
It's perfect timing, huh?
You need something?
I owe it to you to give you this in person.
Your evaluation.
- You' re not going to open it?
- Open it for what?
There's no middle ground with you, is there?
- Blind optimism or self-pity.
- It's just the truth.
It's gonna cripple me.
Just when I learn how to deal with another symptom, it progresses.
- What were you expecting?
- Time.
I expected time.
Enough time to figure out a...
Time's gonna kick my ass.
So, what, that's it?
You' re just gonna give in?
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No. No. I wanted you to recognize your limitations.
I thought you were trying to prove something.
But you probably saved that little boy's life today.
You connected with his father when he was completely lost.
You guided him to make the right decision.
Any idiot can suture a wound, put in a chest tube.
But you have a gift, Mr. Nathan. The gift of a physician.
Now it's up to you to decide if you want to share that gift.
And then find a way.
By the way, I keep my promises.
I failed you.
All they have is Diet Shasta.
- They still make this?
- I hope so.
They might ask you to testify, you know.
Mom, I need you to be with me on this. He can't stay in military jail.
I'm with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm just scared for him and I'm angry.
I'm angry at you for having to do this again.
- And you didn't do anything.
- You're angry at me for giving it to him.
- No, no. I didn't-
I know you feel like a mother to him.
Why shouldn't you?
You practically raised him.
You have a right.
But I'm his mother and I gave it to him.
I gave it to my son.
All I can do now is try to be his mother.
- I'm sorry. I gave his lawyer this number.
- I'm gonna try to find us a hotel room.
This may take a few days.
- Hello?
- Hey, you turned on your cell phone.
- Hi.
- Well, did you find him?
Yeah, I found him.
They might court-martial him, but I found him.
Did you tell them that he's sick?
They already knew.
It's a long story.
- You still snowed in?
- Oh, the city's a mess.
How are you holding up?
- Do we have any spare monitors?
- For what?
- Fiber-optic otoscope.
- Oh, try Trauma Hall.
Good news. Your appendix appears normal.
- No swelling or inflammation.
- Can she get something to eat?
- She's getting her appetite back.
- A good sign.
- What do you feel like eating, Kiley?
- Pizza. Pizza.
That sounds good.
But you should have some soup until your tummy's settled.
All right.
CT's negative. She can go home.
Drink some clear liquids, and come back tomorrow.
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver.
- I never finished checking Kiley's ear.
- You don't have to. We' re fine.
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt her.
- Can you help me?
- Tell him we' re fine.
Don't worry. She's safe.
I think I saw something, so I want you to hold the scope and put it in your ear very gently.
You even get to watch it on TV. - Me?
- Yeah.
You get to be the doctor.
- Is that my ear?
- Actually, it's your eardrum.
- Gross.
- Use cotton swabs?
- Yeah, every night.
- See, that's the problem.
The cotton swab rubs the protective wax. It can cause an ear infection.
- And what can you do about that?
- Well, I could give her some drops.
It's better if she never sticks anything in her ear smaller than her elbow.
- My elbow?
I can't fit my elbow.
- You can't?
- Mr. Nathan, are you almost finished?
- Yeah, almost.
- You' re needed upstairs.
- What is it?
Field is dry. Anastomosis site's intact.
You' re either gonna make me famous or get me arrested for cases like this.
Dr. Nathan, Dr. Carmichael.
I toil for eight hours, and you get the honors.
- Excuse me?
- Over here.
Cardioplegia solution is withdrawn.
Okay.
Shut it down.
This is where you jump from the plane and hope you packed the chute correctly.
- Better grab those paddles.
- What?
Paddles.
We' re gonna need them.
V- fib.
That's your cue.
Clear.
Heart rate, 70.
And that, my friends, makes it all worthwhile.
Start the epi.
Take down the catheters.
I guess his brother will always be with him.
E. R. 9x10 "HINDSIGHT"
Patient number two on high-flow O2 with 500 cc's normal saline in.
- Pressure's 100/80.
- ETA of about four minutes.
Say again the neuro exam on patient two.
Ma'am, can you tell me your name?
What's your name?
Still unresponsive to verbal.
GCS is 324.
Copy that, 37.
Hey, are you from County?
Hey, buddy?
County General.
Clear.
Sit on my lap and tell me what you want for Christmas.
I want it to be January.
It's okay, honey. It's really not Santa.
Frank, can you please stop scaring kids?
- Since when is Santa scary?
- Since he looks like a fat homeless dude.
- Pratt, two incoming. Stick around?
- Do I look like Bob Cratchit?
Just hang out until we see how-
Anybody work here anymore?
- Do you want to go in now?
- I don't know if I'm ready.
Come on.
- Systolic's 100 on maximum dopamine.
- Satting at 91 with 5F PEEP.
He said he was run down, and I told him to see a doctor.
We' re gonna take Rick up to ICU.
Why don't you sit with him until we find him a bed.
- He said it was stress from winter exams.
- It's okay.
He moved. Is that good?
It's probably just a reflex.
Repeat the HemoCue in ABG in half an hour.
Try something more cheerful.
- You think we should up his PEEP?
- His pressure won't tolerate it.
- How'd it go?
- Intermittent decerebrate posturing.
Neurosurg needs to put him on an ICP monitor.
- Where's Dr. Kovac?
- He went home.
- Get him back here.
- I think he needs time.
Get him back.
- This shouldn't have happened.
- Not his fault.
- He missed it.
- He's just a little burned out.
I always thought of you as a big man but compared to Jerry you' re an ambitious elf.
- Dr. Romano, will you tell him to change?
- I always do Santa.
- Not since I've been here.
- I have the perfect:
Sounds more like the Jolly Green Giant.
We already have a wasted Angel of Bethlehem.

She was with one of your docs.
Can't get a pulse.
Get a wheelchair.
Let me check your head.

Get her a collar, tape her head down.
I need x-ray for a lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.
She was walking on the scene.
Step back. You might contaminate the field.
Systolic's only 60.
Free fluid in Morrison's pouch and the right pericolic gutter.
- Probable liver laceration.
Page Trauma. - Dr. Kovac, what happened?
You okay?
Did you hit your head?
No. My side.
- Neck pain?
- No.
The door won't open.
Call 911.
I'll go see about the other car.
We hit someone?
Just wait here.
No. God.
- Stay still. I'm a doctor.
- Elbow kills. I can't move my leg.
- Paramedics are on their way.
- It was the other guy's fault. He was driving like a maniac.
- Son, you all right?
- I don't know.
I think you dislocated your hip.
- Are they okay?
- Who?
- In the other car.
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't move for now, okay?
- What's your name?
- Dwayne.
Dwayne.
- Take a deep breath.
- It hurts.
- Stridor.
- How bad is that?
His collarbone may be broken. The fracture is compressing his windpipe.
Can't breathe.
- Can you help him?
- I'll be right back.
Wait.
Don't leave us here.
Adult with a posterior hip dislocation and a kid with a compromised airway.
Paramedic ETA is less than five.
- I thought I had a toolkit.
- I can't believe you did this.
- I need pliers.
- Pliers?
I have to elevate the depressed clavicle fracture.
How about a suture kit?
Hold on.
- Dwayne?
- I think he's starting to pass out.
Wake up, Dwayne.
This might hurt a little.
- You gonna give him something?
- I don't have drugs with me.
- Shouldn't we wait for the paramedics?
- He's not getting any air.
Scalpel.
- You should sit down.
- I'm okay.
Plastics set, 15 blade. I'm okay.
- Wake up, son. Wake up, son.
- Don't move him.
Oh, God.
Gauze.

- Kelly clamp.
Radial pulse is pretty thready.
I need a tenaculum or a towel clip.
- Wait, they' re here.
- They don't have surgical instruments.
- He's getting cyanotic.
- Out of the way!
He's an ER doc.
Possible dislocated hip there, airway obstruction here.
Okay, take him.
- We should get cleaned up.
- I'm fine.
Looks like 43 got the call too.
- There's some saline and Kerlix over here.
- Okay.
- Did you get the guys in the other car?
- It was just us.
Us?
Erin?
- Weak radial pulse.
- Any other injuries?
She was complaining of right-side pain. Maybe a lacerated liver.
She needs two liters of saline and high-flow O2. Hurry up.
- Who was driving?
- I was.
- Squeeze my hand.
- Pressure's down to 90 systolic.
- Pulse ox, 86.
- Turn it up to six liters.
- How far are we?
- About six minutes. Roads are pretty icy.
I can't hear anything.
- Give me an 18-gauge angiocath.
- She already has two IVs.
- I think it's a tension pneumo. - Take it easy.
Only a few minutes.
I'm gonna needle her chest.
Give me the angiocath.
You've suffered a head injury, I don't think-
- Then you do it.
- No way.
She's gonna arrest.
- Danny, want me to pull over?
- No. Keep going.
Come on, man, don't.
Sats are up to 92.
- It's not your fault.
- I should have been more careful.
Can you slow down?
These things happen.
Two months in the ER doesn't make you an expert, okay?
I'm upset too. It's not just you. Please slow down.
These things don't just happen.
Not if you know what you' re doing.
Okay, pull over.
Let me out.
Luka, they' re ready for Jane in the O. R.
Okay.
Thanks.
Don't you want to talk to them?
It's okay.
You do it.
Okay.
So we're gonna take you upstairs now and the surgeons are gonna remove the clot.
- Is the other doctor here?
- Who?
Dr. Kovac?
- The cute one?
- Dr. Chen, have you seen Luka?
On his way out.
Will you thank him for us?
He made them give Jane the CT.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
What, are you just gonna leave?
My shift's almost over.
Anyway, it wasn't my shift.
- What's going on, Luka?
- I'm fine.
- I'll be fine.
- Not about you.
What you do outside of this hospital, that's up to you.
Not when it starts preventing you from doing your job. When it hurts patients.
Do you even care?
Do you even care that that kid is lying out there as good as dead?
Hey can we get some coffee or something?
- Dr. Lewis said I should go.
- I need some sleep.
Yeah, but I could use the company, and I thought you might too.
- I'm sorry about in the elevator.
- It's okay.
It's a crappy day.
Maybe I gave you the wrong idea last night.
Not at all.
Well, good night then.
Hey can I at least get a ride?
Did RT adjust the vent after the last ABG?
Crit's up to 19 with two units in.
- Sats?
-89 on 100 percent with five of PEEP.
How long was he waiting?
I'm not sure.
Harkins, you should go home.
- Well, isn't there something else I can do?
- Not right now.
Okay.
Luka thought he had the flu.
Did he listen over the stomach after intubation?
I don't know.
- Did he use the end-tidal CO2 detector?
- I don't know, Susan.
He would have had another few years.
Ten if he was lucky.
He was a lot sicker than he seemed.
It doesn't matter.
He was a lot sicker than anyone would have known.
Betadine the neck.
More suction.
- It's as high as it goes.
- There's way too much blood.
- Eleven blade.
- Forget it. Bag him.
Number seven sterile gloves.
Skin hook.
Suction here.

- Heart rate down to 40.
- Amp of atropine.
Open crash cart. - That a seizure?
Decerebrate posturing.
- Got it.
- Platelets are here.
Squeeze them in.
Easy to bag.
- Go ahead.
- The posturing, is it cerebral hypoxia?
So it's brain damage?
- I'll talk to the girlfriend.
- I'll do it.
- Luka.
- I said, I'll do it.
Leukemia?
He didn't know he had it.
Nobody did.
If we'd sent off a CBC earlier we could have started the transfusion and antibiotics on time.
But now he's showing signs of brain damage because he was deprived of oxygen for too long.
Isn't it possible he could still get better?
- It's unlikely.
- But it's not impossible, right?
No, it's not impossible.
We waited out here for so long before they took us in.
- I know.
- So many people got seen before us.
- Why did we have to wait so long?
- He should have received better care.
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe he punishes people?
It wasn't God.
Would you pray with me?
I would feel better if you prayed with me.
I can get the hospital chaplain.
Get a post-intubation film and a blood gas in 20 minutes.
- Sats are dropping.
- That's okay.
Give them a minute. They'll come up.
You look tired.
- Do you want some coffee?
- No.
- This is your flu kid?
- Pulmonary edema. I had to intubate.
- PVCs. Pulse ox is 68.
- Something's not right.
There's a lot of resistance.
Damn. Pull out the tube. You' re in the esophagus.
I heard bilateral breath sounds.
Must have been transmitted.
Listen over the stomach.
- Couldn't you see the cords?
- It was hard to tell.
Bag him up.
Maybe the tube moved when the nurses taped it in.
- Open another 8.0 ET tube.
- Pulse ox up to 80.
- Luka, do you want me to do this? - No.
Let's go.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Yankauer. Too much blood.
- CBC's back.
- Go on.
White blood count's 85,000 with 60 percent blasts.
- He's got acute leukemia.
- What?
- Platelets.
- Twelve thousand.
No wonder he's bleeding so much.
Hang two units, type specific.
Cross another four.
Platelets and FFP. Blood cultures done?
Not yet.
He's septic.
Bag him. Set up the fiber-optic and open up a crike kit.
We' re gonna have to crike him?
