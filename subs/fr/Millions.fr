"OAKVILLE RESIDENTIAL CARE"
E.R. 7x20 "FEAR OF COMMITMENT"
Hi, I'm looking for Carl Ferris.
He's not in his room.
How much longer?
Trudy!
- Where's the damn ambulance? !
- They're on their way.
- What's the problem?
- Nothing to concern yourself with.
- I'm a doctor.
- Then get in here!
I think this guy's having a heart attack!
Make way!
Doctor coming in!
Bernice, shake a leg.
Mr. Ferris? Are you having pain in your chest?
Well, he says yes.
It's like someone's squeezing his heart.
No, no, no.
It's more like he's been punched in the chest.
- When did it start?
- A few hours ago.
Give me your stethoscope. Let's sit him up.
Here we go.
Easy.
- He needs oxygen.
- We're board and care.
We don't have any.
- Jerry, I need your oxygen.
- Get your hands off that!
That's mine!
How am I supposed to breathe now?
- He's in CHF.
- Oh, CHF.
- What's that?
- Congestive heart failure.
- I just take blood pressures.
- I know CPR.
- Dr. Benton? - He's in rapid A-fib.
Let's start a line.
Oh, my God. Look at this.
We can't take orders unless you stay with us.
All right.
Five liters O-2 on a nasal cannula.
Let's get him on the gurney.
- Hang in there, Carl!
- Yeah, you're gonna be fine.
His lungs are wet. We need to treat as failure.
Nitro spray in five minutes.
Forty of Lasix and titrate up to 10 of morphine.
Keep his pressure above 100.
- Lasix and MS.
- What's happening?
You've got fluid in your lungs.
- Ten of morphine.
- This might make you drowsy, okay?
Pressure's holding at 110. Pulse down to 100.
- Am I gonna make it?
- You're doing fine. You're gonna be-
- Anybody hurt?
- No, I don't think so.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
- What happened?
- He came out of nowhere.
- Sir, does your neck hurt?
- A little.
- He pulled out right in front of me.
- I didn't see you.
- Don't move your head.
- I had my lights and sirens on.
- I'll go call another rig.
- No, we'll take him with us.
I don't wash my hair.
I never wash my hair.
It helps.
You shouldn't wash your hair every day.
It gets rid of the natural oils.
Hi, Mom.
- Abby. What are you doing here?
- I'm on a break.
If you comb it too much, you'll damage the ends.
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
- Now it's full of static electricity.
- Winona, your hair looks fine. Really.
I don't think she knows where she is.
Time for your meds, Maggie.
I think Winona needs to go to the bathroom.
- She gets agitated when she has to pee.
- Thanks.
- You need to use the bathroom, Winona?
- I need to fix my hair.
Okay. I'll be right back.
You're gonna have to stay here for a little while.
They're keeping you on a 90-day hold.
I'm sorry.
No, it's me.
I should never have put you through all of that. It's me.
I'm sorry.
Trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Prep the left chest.
- Where does it hurt?
- My chest and stomach.
- Any headache or neck pain?
- No.
No loss of consciousness.
- Someone you'd like us to call?
- My mom.
Let's infiltrate with lidocaine, Malucci.
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.
CBC, chem panel, cardiac enzymes, 12-lead EKG and a portable chest.
He was in A-fib with a rapid ventricular response.
- Heart rate's 88, irregular. - He's in CHF.
How about some Lasix?
We gave him 40.
How you doing, Mr. Ferris?
- You tell me. - Don't worry.
You'll be okay.
I've gotta go work on the crash victim.
Dr. Kovac will take care of you, okay?
Let me see that EKG as soon as it comes back.
Lidocaine's on, second liter of saline is up.
- Do the ultrasound, Malucci.
- Pulse ox, 89 on two liters.
Up it to five. 32 French.
Thank you.
Open a chest-tube tray.
Set up Thora-Seal to low suction.
Get serial crits, due 20 minutes, okay?
Damn it!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Pulse ox down to 85.
- Hurt yourself?
- No.
- I can give it a try if you want.
- I'm fine. Open another tube.
Shove this under the desk.
It's Mr. Simpson's.
You don't wanna know.
Abby, shouldn't you be at the courthouse?
Your mother was just transported to her commitment hearing.
- Aren't you supposed to testify?
- What commitment hearing?
State Attorney's Office should have called.
Well, nobody called me.
Okay. Your mother has contested her certificate of commitment.
By law, she is entitled to a hearing in front of a judge.
- And, what, he could release her?
- Technically.
Attempted suicide is a good argument for a 90-day hold, but since you witnessed-
- When is this happening?
15, county courthouse.
- Tube placement looks good.
- Pressure's up to 120.
I'll meet you at the elevator.
How we doing?
No chest pain after two more nitros.
- Where are you admitting him?
- He's fifth in line for Tele admit.
How long will that take?
Sometimes we rule out Ml, send them home.
He spent two days in the ER last time.
It's okay. I'll sort this out and get you a bed as soon as I'm done in the O.R.
- Thank you, Peter.
- Sure.
She sat there and let me apologize to her, and she knew she was going to court.
She didn't wanna get you involved.
Or doesn't want me to testify against her.
- Are you?
- I don't know.
I have to find this state's attorney, whoever that is.
- I'll go with you.
- No.
- I can get somebody to cover.
- I can't wait.
You shouldn't have to do this by yourself.
I shouldn't have to do this at all.
- You'd rather Carter go with you?
- What's that supposed to mean?
He helped you deal with her before.
I'll call you later.
Nice basket.
Is that for Greene and Corday?
- Yeah, and you still owe $50. - Fifty?
For that?
We got them a baby video monitor.
Nurses pitched in 20, doctors 50.
I pay the same as Benton and Weaver?
- Aren't you a doctor?
- That's debatable.
- Cleo, can you take a lady in Exam 2?
- I'm already juggling seven patients.
I'll trade you one.
Then can you lend me 50 bucks?
Jing-Mei. I got a woman in Exam 2 who hasn't had a bowel movement in over a week. She needs a rectal.
- So do it.
- Well, she threatened to Mace me.
- You should be used to that.
- Take this one.
No.
Forget it.
- What's the problem here?
- I don't know. Maybe it's your B.S.
- Or maybe it's PMS.
- Excuse me?
Look, I'm just saying-
It's okay for you to dump a patient on me and for you to refuse any handoffs.
But the minute I do, it's because I'm a bitch...
- ... or that time of the month!
Screw you. - Forget it.
- I'll leave.
- I'm tired of your crap!
- Another 2-0 silk.
- Pressure's holding at 120.
Dr. Benton, what are you still doing in here?
The gastrosplenic and splenorenal were very vascular.
- Are you suturing with your left hand?
- Yes, I'm ambidextrous.
Like hell.
I've seen third-year medical students sew faster.
Let me see you use your right hand.
- Sterile gloves.
What happened?
- I may have bruised my wrist.
- How?
- Fell to an outstretched hand.
Perfect mechanism for a fracture.
Get your hands out of the field, Peter.
- What?
- Hold them out like this. Fingers spread.
- Your radius and ulna feel okay?
- I'm fine.
Point tenderness at the snuff box.
We call that a scaphoid fracture.
Scrub out.
- I can finish. I'm almost done.
- No, you are done.
If this poor devil had some complication and his lawyers discovered you were operating with the wrong hand we both might as well bend over.
Be thankful you're not a racehorse, Peter.
I'd have to take you out and shoot you.
- Dr. Benton, your wife's here.
- What?
I'm not married.
- I'm sorry.
Carla.
- Where is she?
- How long have you had the pain?
- A few hours.
- When was your last period?
- Seven weeks ago.
When I didn't get it, I did a home pregnancy test.
It was positive.
- That was two weeks ago.
- Have you seen your gynecologist?
- You have a history of migraines?
- Yeah.
And are you on any medication?
Inderal and sumatriptan.
But they're not helping.
It just keeps getting worse.
- So where's the pain?
- It's all around my right eye.
- How many other pregnancies?
- This is my first.
- Am I having a miscarriage?
- I can't tell until we do some tests.
And a pelvic exam as well.
It pounds with every heartbeat.
I think it's the numbers.
What, you're an accountant or something?
No, binary numbers.
Ones and zeros.
Electronic data.
80, 146, 72, 109.
- Deb.
- What?
80, 146, 72, 109.
Freaky.
I warned you!
- What happened?
- Patient Maced him.
- You happy now? !
- Flush his eyes with saline. Call Security.
Give me that pepper spray. Give it to me!
Do you want me to have you arrested?
I told him not to touch me or my personal possessions.
Dr. Malucci was only trying to help you.
You could have seriously injured him.
Well, I hope I taught him some manners.
- Have you been in this ER before?
- I've been in a lot ers.
And to be honest, this one's substandard.
Maybe you'd feel more comfortable in jail.
They used to drown redheaded babies because they thought they were evil.
And they used to burn crazy people who they thought were witches.
I just need something to help me go to the bathroom.
Is that too much to ask? !
- She's historically non-med compliant?
- Well, she has phases.
- But this time she's been off for about- - Ma'am. Six months.
- How many serious suicide attempts?
- This one makes three.
- Don't you know this stuff?
- Just reviewing before we go in.
I got the case this morning.
- Hey, Marty.
You got Wyninski?
- Wyczenski.
- Wyczenski.
Sorry. - Yeah. Drug overdose.
So you're stipulating to an attempted suicide, right?
No, but nice try.
No intent.
- I'm sorry, what was your name again?
- Abby.
- Did you witness the attempt, Abby?
- I was with her.
She took the pills in a bathroom.
Who was that?
Your mother's public defender.
Since they won't stipulate I'll have you testify to the intention and lethality of the attempt.
- Nobody called me to testify.
- That's why you're here, right?
You want your mother to stay committed.
Well, yes, but somebody should have-
Okay. You're here now.
Come on.
I think we pretty much have it all...
Just answer all the questions that we talked about.
Peter, I thought you would never get here.
- What happened?
- I was carrying Reece.
I stepped in a grate in the sidewalk and twisted my ankle so bad I thought I was going to pass out.
Was he hurt?
Are you hurt?
He scraped his elbow.
He's okay.
Carla, you were carrying him while you were wearing these?
They said they wanna operate.
I kept telling them to call you.
I do not want an operation.
Yeah, well, you have a trimalleolar fracture.
They'll have to put a screw in it so it'll heal properly.
- Can't you do it?
- No. You need an orthopedic surgeon.
Well, how long am I gonna have to stay in the hospital?
- A couple of days.
- I can't.
Roger's out of town.
Yeah, is he ever around?
We haven't been getting along well lately.
Which is one of the reasons why I cannot deal with this right now.
I'll take Reece for a couple of days till you get back on your feet.
I don't think that's gonna be a good idea.
Why not?
Jackie told me that you moved in with that girlfriend.
- And that's a problem?
- It's not a good environment for our son.
Carla, give me a break.
She's a pediatrician.
I'm just saying she don't seem like the motherly type.
She was admitted following a suicide attempt.
That's not what I asked, Dr. DeRaad.
Has Mrs. Wyczenski shown any signs of suicidality since her admission?
Not that I'm aware of.
She has voluntarily submitted for all treatments and medications recommended by your department?
- That's correct.
- No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, doctor. Does the state have any more witnesses?
Yes, Your Honor.
The people call Abby Lockhart.
Hold on.
All right, I was next. I was next.
It's my turn.
That's enough.
The testimony you shall give will be the truth and nothing but the truth?
Please have a seat.
It was my turn.
You're Mrs. Wyczenski's daughter?
I've been waiting. This bitch took my turn.
Settle down.
- Miss Lockhart?
- Yes.
And as such, you support a mandatory hold for your mother because she might attempt to kill herself again.
- Objection.
Leading.
- Sustained.
Miss Lockhart, do you feel your mother should be involuntarily committed?
- Yes.
- Why?
- No. There are no such thing as cuts! - Russell?
No back cuts! No front cuts!
No, it's my turn!
- That bitch stole my spot! Take her! - Come on.
- You take her out!
I didn't do anything!
- Shut up.
She took my spot!
He was pushed down in an altercation.
No LOC.
Tenderness to mid-shaft clavicle.
- You said there's no LOC?
- He's faking.
Vitals are normal.
No chest or belly pain.
- What's his name?
- He refused to give it.
He said it was "O. Possum. "
His name's Brett Paxton, and he's crazy.
- What's this?
- Human bite to the left hand.
I'll need stitches, thanks to this freak.
Cool it! Cool it!
Okay. Okay.
Take the opossum to Exam 1 and get the kangaroo to Sutures. Come on.
- God! Okay, okay, okay!
- You need to flush them out.
Well, you've flushed enough already. Okay?
- Here you go.
- You know I've never worn one of those.
Well, maybe it's time you at least started dressing like a doctor. Come on.
- What?
- Carter, your pregnancy's bleeding out!
- Where is she?
- She's passed out in the bathroom.
Noni? Oh, my God.
Noni, can you hear me? Wake up!
- I can't find a pulse.
- She's got a weak carotid.
Get a gurney.
- You're divorced, Mrs. Lockhart?
- Objection.
Irrelevant.
- Goes to living arrangements, Your Honor.
- I'll allow it.
Yes.
- And when was your divorce finalized?
- Last summer.
- Have you been dating anyone?
- Your Honor?
Get to the point, Mr. Nesmith.
Your mother can be eccentric, maybe a little embarrassing at times?
She suffers from a debilitating mood disorder.
Having her live with you while trying to date would be a major inconvenience?
I've tried having her live with me before several times.
- It doesn't work.
- Doesn't work?
No.
She stops taking her medications, she loses control and she disappears.
Does she look out of control to you?
She's on her meds now.
- So she does take her medication.
- She's only taken them for a week.
As long as she's med compliant, she's not a danger.
- She doesn't stay med compliant.
- That wasn't my question.
Have you known your mother to be a danger to herself while med compliant?
No. Not usually.
You think locking her up in a psychiatric facility would be better for her?
- I can't take care of her.
- Can't or won't?
- She tried to kill herself while with me.
- Nonresponsive.
- Please. Just answer the questions.
- Well, tell him to ask them.
- You okay?
- Yes!
- Would you like some water?
- No, thank you.
BP's 60 palp.
- What's her HemoCue?
-10.8.
Good.
She's got a little reserve.
No fetal pole, no heartbeat.
Just blood and POCs.
- That's an incomplete miscarriage.
- Call OB. She needs a D and C.
I'll do a pelvic to see if-
- Carter, this is her boyfriend.
- What happened?
Your girlfriend had a miscarriage, but it's incomplete.
- She needs a D and C to stop bleeding.
- She's gonna be okay?
She might need a transfusion.
I'll speak with you after she's stabilized.
- Oh, God! - Can you take him outside?
Call for packed cells. If pressure's not up after two liters HemoCue every 30 minutes.
Are human bites really worse than dog bites?
Yeah, because of the virulence of the bacteria.
If germs infect the joint, it can cause scarring which can limit your range of motion.
You don't wanna lose your opposable thumb.
So you guys rival mascots or something?
No, we were at the Furturama show. It's a convention for furries.
People who like to dress in animal costumes.
He started it.
I think he'd been drinking.
- One minute he was skritching me-
- Skritching?
Scratching. Mock grooming.
Sort of our version of a handshake.
Next thing you know, he's got his hand in my pouch.
So I decked him.
I'm not into the weird stuff.
It makes me sick.
I never felt like myself.
I told the doctors that. They never really listen to me.
They just keep giving me more pills.
- How do you feel now?
- Better.
- So you're no longer depressed?
- No.
Did you try to kill yourself during your last depressive episode?
I took an overdose of sleeping pills, yes.
But I never meant to kill myself.
She's lying.
Why did you take so many pills?
Who in their right mind wants to drive from Oklahoma to Chicago, really?
I get carsick.
I just thought if I could sleep, I'd be all right.
I took some pills.
- She took 900 milligrams.
- They didn't work right away.
You know, I foolishly then took some more pills.
- She took 900 milligrams.
That's 36 pills. - How much did you take?
I know it was stupid.
I just thought if I could sleep...
The next thing I know, I woke up in the hospital.
But I never meant to hurt myself or anyone else.
Abby, I'm so sorry.
I never meant to put you through that.
Ask her where she got the pills.
- She stole them.
- Mr. Rifkin could you please ask your witness to be quiet?
If your daughter's not ready to take you in, are you able to take care of yourself?
I always have.
I've always worked. Always.
- Do you have any money?
- I have a few credit cards.
- They' re all canceled.
- I mean it, Miss Lockhart.
HemoCue every 20 minutes.
Set up a DIC panel and call me with the results.
- What's happening?
- She's going up to the O.R.
I removed some tissue from her cervix.
She's still bleeding but it's slowed to the point that her pressure's okay.
- Did you do a blood transfusion?
- We gave her plasma.
- Her blood wasn't clotting properly.
- Why isn't her blood clotting?
It could be a sign of liver disease. The liver affects the clotting factors.
She ever have hepatitis?
No.
- She drink alcohol every day?
- No.
Tylenol?
Any other medications?
Maybe some herbal stuff.
What kind of herbal stuff?
Root extracts.
They' re supposed to induce miscarriages.
I thought she wanted this baby.
She didn't know.
- How could she not know?
- I gave them to her.
You what?
Put them in her tea for the last few days.
She didn't even ask me if I wanted the baby.
- So you poisoned her?
- I wasn't ready.
- I thought she'd just-
- What?
Bleed to death?
I didn't mean to make her sick.
No, man, you just meant to kill her baby.
You have a large tumor on your left ovary.
I came in here because I couldn't poop.
The tumor is large enough that it's blocking your bowel movements.
Cancer?
Well, well, well.
Every day comes with its own surprises.
- What?
- Nothing.
That's how I know you.
You're Princess Taffeta.
And you had that children's show I used to watch all the time when I was little.
And you always used to say, "Every day comes with its own surprises. "
- I don't think so.
- You worked with those great puppets.
There was Mojo and Mr. Whiskers, and what was that-?
Coconuts! The chimpanzee in the sailor uniform.
We got that monkey from a lab and we had to dress him in that stupid outfit to hide his open sores!
We need to admit you.
A gynecologist will want to see you and start treatment right away.
No, thanks.
I don't like hospitals!
Look, the tumor will only get worse, and you'll feel sicker.
Is there someone that we can call?
A family member, perhaps, who can talk to you about this?
Nope.
Don't have any brothers or sisters and never got married.
I was engaged once to a man named Christopher Clemmons.
He was gonna be a famous jazz musician.
I was gonna be a movie star.
Doesn't really matter now.
In the end, everybody dies alone. Right?
Excuse me, you got a light?
- This is turning into a freaking disaster.
- Who's covering for you?
- Don't worry about it.
I'm not hungry.
She's asking for you.
- Maybe you should talk to her.
- What for?
You didn't want me to deal with her.
No.
I thought she needed hospitalization.
Well, why do you think I'm here?
Because you know she needs your help, even if she doesn't want it.
- I thought you should eat something.
- Thank you.
You lied.
You wanted to kill yourself.
I can't be committed.
Well, you need help, Mom.
And I obviously don't know how to help you.
I understand.
I don't want to be a burden to you, Abby.
I swear that's the truth.
But I can't be committed.
So you'll just do this to yourself over again?
- You'll just roll through the whole cycle?
- No.
Then what?
What? What are you gonna do differently this time?
I don't know.
I don't want to break any more promises to you.
I've put you through so much already-
If you believe that, you'd seek treatment.
- I will.
I just-
- Can't be committed.
Right. Well...
Well, just forgive me if I don't trust your judgment.
I would have found a way to try, Abby.
It's not your fault.
Nothing I do is your fault.
My company has this Christmas charity event.
One year the guy who always dresses up for the kids got sick.
My boss made me put on this reindeer suit.
The kids went nuts.
The adults thought it was great.
Everybody took pictures with me.
- Sounds almost fun.
- It was a blast.
I used to be so shy.
But the suit gives you freedom.
It lets you do things you normally wouldn't do.
- But I'm not a plushie or a furvert.
- A what?
Furverts like to wear their suits during sex.
And plushies are overly fond of stuffed animals.
- What?
- But not me.
I just like the suit.
Some people disapprove and think it's wrong, but the truth is I'm never happier than when I'm a kangaroo.
You have to rule out appendicitis, biliary disease, food poisoning.
- Does she have a fever?
- No. 98.8.
Good breath sounds.
What's that smell?
- Oh, my God.
- I've seen this before.
Get a surgical consult. I'll call DCFS.
No. It's a folk cure.
They heat a coin over a candle and drag it across the back.
Sometimes they dip the coins in essential oils.
Just because it's an ancient tradition doesn't mean it's not child abuse.
The minty smell is oil of wintergreen. It's got a high concentration of salicylates.
It could have caused the aspirin toxicity.
Let's get a blood gas and a salicylate level.
You do that.
I'm calling Family Services.
- Will I be able to have more children?
- Yes.
Noni, what your boyfriend did was really wrong.
You need to consider whether or not to file criminal charges.
Victor loves me.
- He just got scared.
- That doesn't justify what he did.
I was so excited to be pregnant.
What do you want to do?
Mrs. Wyczenski, are you familiar with reading directions and warnings on over-the-counter medications?
Yes, I suppose so.
Would you please read the label on this?
I'm sorry, I don't have my reading glasses.
I can't see.
- Allow me, then. - Okay.
"One tablet at bedtime. May repeat in four hours if necessary.
Do not exceed four tablets in a 24-hour period. "
You took 36 tablets, did you not?
I didn't have my reading glasses with me then either.
You took 36 pills and you didn't intend to kill yourself?
I was depressed, but I didn't want to kill myself. Really.
- Where did you get the pills?
- I got them at a convenience store.
How did you pay for them?
- I didn't.
- You stole them?
Objection.
Shoplifting has nothing to do with suicidality.
- Goes to intent.
- Get to it quickly.
Why did you have to steal them?
Why didn't you ask your daughter to pay for them?
- She wouldn't have.
- Why not?
- She was worried.
- Worried that you'd try to kill yourself?
She worries when I get depressed.
Because during other depressions you have attempted suicide.
In fact, you've been committed on two other occasions for attempted suicide.
- In '83 and 1974.
- Yes.
- What method did you use for those?
- Carbon monoxide poisoning.
In '83.
- What about in '74?
- I took some pills.
Did you coin Lynda because she's sick?
I don't understand what you're saying.
Could someone get me a translator?
Where's Chen?
Look who's here!
Your cardiac enzymes are back, Mr. Ferris.
You had a small heart attack.
What did I tell you?
I know heart attacks.
- I'm lucky you showed up when you did.
- We kept you alive till he got there.
If there are any blockages, we'll open it with an angioplasty balloon... - ... and we'll keep it open with a stent. - Thank you, Peter.
Not bad for a guy who blew up a rubber in your classroom.
I'll check on you later.
Hi, Reece.
What are you doing here?
His mother broke her ankle.
She's waiting to be admitted to Surgery.
- Could you look at a belly?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
I don't understand what you're saying.
Could you just calm down?
- She seems pretty upset.
- You think?
You speak Cantonese?
You think?
I was a translator in the Army.
Could you ask her what she treated her granddaughter with?
- I think I can manage. - Excuse me.
Malucci.
Her labs are back. Electrolytes are normal.
No anion gap.
PH 7.4.
Salicylate level's 10 milligrams per deciliter.
- Well, that's not a toxic range.
- Nope.
Her liver-function tests and her head CT are also normal.
Then it's one hell of a case of gastroenteritis.
We've given her 10 of Compazine.
She's still puking.
Peter's looking at her now.
I'll let you know.
Well, anything?
She said she used hot coins and liniment.
Yeah, I know that.
But did she say why?
She's possessed.
Grandma or the girl?
What are we talking here, demonic spirits?
No, more like evil thoughts.
Sinful behavior.
You know, S-E-X.
Faye? Faye!
Faye, where are you going?
Where're you going?
I got a garden party at 6.
You need to be admitted to the hospital so you can start treatment.
- We both know that's not gonna happen.
- You can't leave. Come on.
I've never been one for hospitals.
They smell funny.
Besides, I already signed the papers.
Will you at least speak to a psychiatrist?
Mr. Whiskers.
- Take it.
- No, I can't. Really.
Look, honey, I'm gonna be dead in a few months.
You said so yourself.
Make me feel better knowing he's with someone who'll appreciate him.
Stupid puppet ended my acting career.
But it did buy my first house.
Every day comes with its own surprises.
A statement from a former employer of Mrs. Wyczenski-
- I don't need any more statements.
- The employer affirms that-
We've spent more than enough time on this one already. Let's move on.
Mrs. Wyczenski is released on her own recognizance.
- What's next, Mike?
- Well, that's good.
- Is this yours, Marty?
- Yes, it is.
- So I can just go?
- Yes, you can go.
- Wait a minute.
That's it?
- I'm sorry.
- She's letting her go?
- Is the respondent here?
- Yes, he is, Your Honor.
- She needs hospitalization!
I'm not debating it with you.
You've counseled your client?
- I have.
- Yeah, but, I mean, that's-
We did all we can.
I'm sorry. We have to move on.
You're done. It's good. Just go back to the hospital and sign out.
Okay.
That's good. Move on.
All of you should just move on.
We wouldn't want to waste time on this.
- I've been dealing with her for 30 years. - Russell?
You didn't have to drive her to the hospital. Pour charcoal down her throat. Breathe for her.
- This way.
- I'm getting my coat!
Just don't touch her.
She's not your mother.
What do you care?
The rest of us will take care of her.
And maybe if you're really lucky next time you won't have to hear the case at all.
Maybe next time you'll do it right!
And then it'll be the coroner's problem.
No evidence of appendicitis or pancreatitis.
- Biliary colic?
- No.
- I'm about to give up.
- Did you check for pyelo?
Yes. And hepatitis.
You should get an x- ray of that wrist if it's bothering you.
I'm fine.
- What will you do with Reece?
- I left a message for Jackie.
Hopefully she can pick him up on her way home from work.
Why don't you take him home?
You can't do anything with that hand.
I wanna stick around until Ferris gets a room.
Then I'll take him home with me.
I'm off in an hour.
- No, I don't want you to have to do that.
- I don't mind.
We'll have fun, right?
- All right.
Thanks.
- You have to let me take an x-ray.
Come on, you're resorting to blackmail?
What the hell is that?
I remember Mr. Whiskers!
Where did you get him? On eBay?
Princess Taffeta was the patient who Maced you.
- That's probably worth some money.
- Looks like roadkill.
Malucci, there's a priest in with Lynda An?
- Yeah.
He's doing an exorcism.
- Excuse me?
Actually, he's a chaplain, and it's more of a blessing.
But it should work.
I think her problem's psychosomatic.
Based on your vast knowledge of psychiatry?
And the fact her grandma caught her messing around with her boyfriend.
It's all about guilt.
Hey, how's it working out with Lynda?
- I think she's gonna be fine.
- Excellent.
- How are you feeling, Lynda?
- Hungry.
- No more nausea?
- No.
I'm starving.
She's eating solid foods and not vomiting.
She's ready to go home.
I'd like to admit you, keep you overnight for observation and rehydration.
- Could I get a pizza or something?
- We'll see what we can work out, okay?
- Nice catch.
- I'd still like to do some more tests.
Why, because you can't admit that a surgeon and a pediatrician got outsmarted by a goombah?
Yeah. Don't sweat it.
You're not the first to be deceived by my rugged good looks and boyish charm.
By signing, you acknowledge doctors feel it's best you remain hospitalized and you accept and understand by leaving against medical advice you risk a deterioration of your psychiatric symptoms.
What about my meds?
Can I have a prescription?
I will give you three days' worth.
I want to see you Monday.
If you' re doing well, I'll give you a week's worth.
- Okay. - Okay what?
What does that mean?
- Could I call you?
- Sure.
- All right. - You can call me anytime.
- You can call me just to talk. - Okay.
I got some stuff from that motel room and some stuff you left in my apartment.
- Thank you.
- Figure out where you're going?
Yeah.
Dr. Legaspi gave me the name of a shelter.
I'm gonna go there for a few days.
Good luck, Maggie.
- See you next time.
- Next time?
Yeah, whenever it is, wherever it is...
Maybe there won't be a next time.
You're gonna walk out of here on your own one week after swallowing a pharmacy, as close to death as I see people get and you think there's not gonna be a next time?
I hope not.
I don't know.
I promised myself I wouldn't make any promises.
You know when I saw you seizing on that table, I thought:
"This is it.
This is it. This is how it's all gonna end.
I am going to watch my mother die. "
I still might not be wrong about that.
It could still end that way.
And there's not one thing I can do about it.
But I'll show up.
Because you will always have that power over me.
I will show up and I will try to stop it.
I love you, Mom.
- How long will she be in the hospital?
- We'll keep her overnight for observation.
- Could I see her?
- I don't think so.
- I wanna talk to her.
- She prefers to be alone.
You need to speak to the police.
- Is this him?
- It's him.
This is between me and Noni.
What did you do, talk her into pressing charges?
- I didn't have to.
Murder is a felony.
- Come with me, sir.
It wasn't even a baby.
Can I speak with Dr. Quaid?
Daryl Quaid.
Well, he gave me his card and it has this number on it.
One of those days?
Ever find out what happened with your numbers guy?
Don't know.
He left with this doctor from the VA.
I just called to follow up but there's no record of my patient or the doctor I let him leave with.
- What will you do?
- Same thing as I always do.
Hit a bar, get drunk, go home with a stranger and have wild sex until I pass out from exhaustion.
- Takeout and a hot bath? - Yeah.
- Randi, have you seen my puppet?
- Your what?
- Mr. Whiskers.
- I didn't touch it. Trust me.
Can't believe somebody would steal that.
- Where do you guys want Super Larry?
- Exam 1.
- The opossum guy's still in there.
- Okay. Well, let's get rid of him.
Mr. Paxton?
Mr. Paxton? You still playing opossum?
Mr. Whiskers!
- Whatever happened to Mrs. Lindstrom?
She was mean.
That woman was born mean.
Even the other teachers were afraid of her.
I'm sure you thought the same of me with all those detentions I gave you.
Your detentions steered me towards medicine.
So...
I might have played a small role in it.
I'm proud of you, Peter.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
And you should be proud of yourself.
I am.
Look, don't get me wrong.
Sometimes it's hard when people's lives depend on your success and you're not always successful.
Sometimes you- Sometimes you get so tired that you start forgetting what's important.
And what is that?
Two things in this world I'm certain of:
My love for my son and my skills as a surgeon.
I'm a father, I'm a doctor.
At the end of the day, that's enough.
What about a teacher?
That was never one of my greatest skills.
The only skill you need to be a good teacher is to care.
That's all.
Who knows? Maybe one of your students will wind up saving your ass one day.
I heard you were here, but I haven't seen you.
Yeah. Most of my day is spent in the jail ward.
I'm sorry.
I was glad to hear that the charges were dropped.
Shannon Wallace decided to tell the truth after she got the treatment that she needed.
That's good.
- What do you want, Kerry?
- I thought you might be hungry.
No. No, I'm not, and I have a ton of work to do.
So...
Right. Well, if you change your mind here's some Kung Pao chicken from George's.
Abby, are you okay in there?
Want some dinner?
You need to eat.
Have you been watching Martha Stewart again?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For being there.
And here.
Everything.
- Is the food here?
- What food?
I'm making dinner by myself.
Why are you laughing?
I just hope you didn't order from that Thai place again.
Who is it?
E.R. 8x01 "FOUR CORNERS" Subtítles TusSeries Psych?
My daughter doesn't need a psychiatrist.
I just need to talk to her. That's all.
- Can you get him on the phone?
- When did he die?
It's Dr. Carter in the ER.
- How long does a CAT scan take?
- I'll hold.
I'm off at 4 if you want to go get coffee.
- Two hundred people back at the house.
- There's coffee there, isn't there?
I wouldn't ask you to subject yourself to that.
- Dr. Weisman?
- Yes?
You have a patient, Holly Evans, who was supposed to be admitted last night.
Say he doesn't die on the table or in post-op.
You ship him back to his convenience-store alley.
But this time, instead of getting beaten up he gets eaten by dogs because he's too weak to move.
- Eaten by dogs?
- It happens.
- In Chicago?
- A lot. A cop told me.
Dr. Romano needs you in his office immediately.
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.
He says it's important.
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.
- Hey, Mark, you got a second?
- No.
Look, is Cleo having trouble with the triple cocktail?
- What?
- She was nauseated.
She's alone and afraid.
And has now been waiting for almost 20 hours.
No.
No, pull your thumb out, get down here and admit your patient.
Give her another gram of cefoxitin and order a clear-liquid diet.
- "Pull your thumb out"?
- Call me in half an hour if someone from Pedes doesn't get down here.
Exactly what don't you want me to subject myself to?
- Dr. Weaver.
- Abby, John.
- Things are a little tense.
See you later.
- I can imagine. Queen Elizabeth wants me to meet her boy.
- Got room for a Haldol deficiency?
- Over there.
Because we are compatible.
- Who, you and Prince Charles?
- He likes coffee and so do I.
- I could be princess.
- He is mine, honey.
- Abby?
MVA with psi rolling up.
- Coming.
- Hey, you stay away from him.
- I promise. There's an apartment listed in that building.
- Which?
- The one you like on Clark.
Two bedrooms, big closets, wood floors.
- You went there?
- Yeah. I called the manager.
She already had two people interested.
- Are you seriously considering it?
- I thought you liked that area.
Oh, I can't afford that kind of rent.
- Don't worry about it.
- And I'm pretty happy where I am.
- Oh, I-
- You know-
- How much is this?
- For you, $20. - Is it real?
- Of course. No.
I mean authentic.
Direct from Kenya, pretty lady.
Imported with my own two hands. All right.
I'll take it.
It's not a gift.
At some point, we have to have some standards.
Who decides, you?
They decided when they chose to participate.
You judge someone based on what they do in their bedroom?
Look, I have no problem with alternative lifestyles. But we 're talking about role models here. So you would oppose gay teachers?
I oppose any homosexual in a job where they interact and influence-
Exactly what don't you want me to subject myself to? - Dr. Weaver.
- Abby, John.
- Hey, chief.
Back in the saddle so soon?
- Yeah.
We weren't expecting you. - It's been three weeks.
- Already?
Man, the time really flies when you're, you know, missing a colleague.
Malik, you got that x-ray going?
- What x-ray?
- The one with the kid.
Yeah.
Abby, MVA with a psi rolling up. - I love your hair color.
It's perfect. - Oh, thank you.
- It's strong.
It's very- - Thank you.
- Awesome bracelet. Where'd you get it? - A place in Nairobi.
- Was it totally amazing?
- What? - Africa.
- It was exactly as I remembered it.
She's not breathing.
Pulse is thready, bradying down to 50.
P.E.A. Starting compressions.
Two of O-neg on the infuser.
Get some saline. - How'd she get upstairs?
- She's an ER patient?
Came in with facial fracture, abdominal pain, broken wrist.
Waiting for Psych. Pregnant with her brother's baby. - Why wasn't anyone monitoring?
- Short-handed with Legaspi gone.
Another 2 cc's in the cuff.
Hey, give me a vascular clamp.
They haven't replaced Legaspi?
- Someone said she got a job in California. - We should be so lucky.
Is that true?
Dr. Weaver, have you heard from Dr. Legaspi?
Probably a tension pneumo. - What happened?
- Four-story fall.
GCS of 3. Now in P.E.A. - How did she fall?
- She jumped.
Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.
- Did she ever have a pulse? - No.
- Try for a central line.
- No.
Open up another tray.
We've got this, Kerry.
Go get cleaned up.
- Prep for a subclavian.
- I want a second chest tube first.
-10 blade.
Let's move.
- Really, Kerry, we've got it.
- Set up a Thora-Seal. - Holding compressions.
- Pretty agonal.
You want atropine?
- Yeah.
Push a milligram.
Let's set up a pericardiocentesis.
- What did you say to her? - Nothing.
How long are we going?
Dr. Weaver, how was your trip?
Hot.
It was hot.
Hey, I never got a chance to thank you.
- I got my Chief Resident confirmation.
- I won't let you down. - I'm sure you won't.
No!
No!
No, no, no!
- You should sue that Scottish bastard.
- What?
Sleazebag host will say anything to get you on his show.
Mr. Peterson started a brawl at a talk-show taping.
Somebody smacked me with a microphone.
Carl?
Stay the hell away from me, you queer.
- Carl, let me drive you home.
- I don't dig penises, okay? - I have only one more operation.
- Touch me, I swear-
Hey.
You need to calm down.
Calm down?
This thing makes me look like some twisted fairy.
Part of you knew.
- Security.
You see this, huh? Man, woman.
That's what I know.
That's normal. It's still love, Carl.
Love is love.
It's perverted, you faggot!
It's sick. You disgust me.
- Calm down, sir.
- You're a freak!
- Please calm down.
- Damn homo.
You all right?
Take it easy, all right?
- You going to the MM? - What?
On Fossen.
The MM's starting.
Luka, has there been any talk about me?
Kerry, people always talk about their bosses.
No, I-
- I mean personally. - Personally?
Well, Dr. Weaver.
I thought maybe you fell under the spell of some Masai warrior and were never coming back.
Coming in?
Why wasn't lidocaine given for a stable V-tach?
I didn't have the ACLS drug box with me.
When transferring a critical patient?
The Trauma nurse ran out to get it but then the doors closed unexpectedly.
- Leaving you alone with the patient?
- Right.
Dr. Legaspi, however, is a lesbian. Am I right? - Yes.
- Isn't that a little barbaric?
I've never hidden that fact from this administration or my colleagues. Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
How many openly gay women do you know in hospital administrative positions? None.
It doesn't happen.
Then deal with the stigma of being gay.
You care to comment on that?
Dr. Weaver.
In your opinion, was the patient's care compromised?
Compromised?
Did the ER accept too many Trauma patients that day?
I don't believe so.
We were busy, but we handled it.
Watch your back.
Kerry, you under the weather?
- Excuse me?
- You were a little slow on the uptake.
Jet lag. Oh, yes.
Your trip to Africa, was it?
Spontaneous decision.
Doesn't seem like you.
Half of my accrued personal days were about to expire.
It still doesn't justify you going MIA for three weeks with no real warning.
You know what?
I took a vacation. I may take another. I still have 19 days banked.
I see.
You might want to try Papua New Guinea next time.
I hear they put gourds on their penises.
Give some notice next time.
- Wait. Robert.
- Careful, Kerry.
- You okay? - Yeah.
I'm good.
You know, you could just call my office.
You don't have to beat up the elevator.
You...
- Who have you told?
- Told who what?
About what we discussed before I left.
Oh, yes. Legaspi.
As ordered, I backed off. But she was determined to leave, decided she didn't like us anymore and was gonna move and work in San Francisco, I understand.
Go figure.
Have you told anyone about me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.
Have you told anyone that I'm a lesbian?
No, Kerry.
I assumed that that was confidential.
Was I wrong to assume that?
I mean, if you want to tell everyone, that's your business.
But I don't see how a person's sexual affairs are appropriate subject matter for a workplace conversation, do you, Kerry?
No.
Glad we're on the same page.
- We got aluminum rotors in stock? - Doubt it. Want me to order some?
- If it's not too much trouble.
- Pads too?
I'm sure your father will give me a deal.
If I ever need an operation, you better not charge me.
Just for parts.
- What's this, summer session?
- Chem 2.
Look, if you can pay him, you should pay him. - Mom got fired.
- What happened?
You can only take a leave of absence for just so long.
You should bring Cleo over. - We haven't seen you guys in a while.
- We're taking a little break right now.
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
She's going through some rough stuff and she needed a little room.
- No, not yet.
I'm gonna try him again in a few.
Look at that.
You'd think she had fangs.
- He said he'd come to check on me.
Nine years I've been hosting a talk show. I've never gotten bit.
- I thought those fights were all staged. - Not exactly.
But people don't usually get hurt.
We use lightweight furniture, just in case.
Guys tend to get unglued when their lover tells them she used to be a man.
- Can you get AIDS from a she-male bite? - What?
I think one of the transsexuals bit me.
Excuse me.
She broke the skin.
- Cleo?
Hey, you all right?
- Y eah. - I heard you got sick.
- A little nauseous.
- Trouble with your meds?
- I'm fine.
You're still taking them, though, right?
- Do you want to help out? - Sure.
A 20-year-old girl fell down and broke her left wrist.
Doesn't sound surgical.
Then smacked repeatedly with a folding chair to the face and abdomen. - Talk-show brawl?
- She's a little worked up.
Just found out her boyfriend is also her half-brother.
Right.
Up.
Down. Okay.
You might have a facial fracture.
I need to see some x-rays.
Is this tender? How about here?
I need to use ultrasound on your belly to rule out internal bleeding, okay?
- Get out!
- Get out!
- Let me explain-
- You tell me on TV.
- I know.
You keep this from me.
You let me date him.
And you knew we were having sex, and you tell me on TV! - The producers made me do that.
- Get out!
- You need to sit and let us monitor you.
Alice, honey, I love you.
- I can explain this whole thing. - Get out!
- I can explain this.
- Get out! - Please.
- Alice?
Can you tell if I'm pregnant with that? Do you think you are?
I might be.
It looks like about 10 weeks.
I was gonna keep it.
This can't be happening.
This can't be true. I love him so much.
It's not fair.
There's no intra-abdominal bleeding, but I'm gonna get a CT scan of your face.
Could you close the curtain?
Sure.
- Dr. Benton, can I discharge Molton?
- As soon as he's done with his IV.
Also, this girl needs a facial CT and a Psych consult. - Weaver's here!
- What?
Why didn't someone say she was working?
- She's on the schedule. - Take this down.
I know I know you from somewhere.
- I wouldn't forget that smile. - All right.
Put Neosporin on it three times a day and don't wash your hair for two days. No way.
I'm a bridesmaid on Saturday. I have to wash my hair.
I wanna look good.
Dr. Romano needs you in his office immediately. - Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.
He says it's important.
- Something wrong? - I don't know.
- Hey, Mark, you got a minute?
- No.
Is Cleo having trouble with the triple cocktail?
- She was nauseated.
- Has she had a repeat antibody test?
- You should ask her.
I want to make sure they're following her LFTs.
Peter, you should talk to her.
- Uncle Peter. - Joanie?
- What's wrong?
- Can I talk to you?
Your parathyroidectomy's ready to go.
Put his film on a view box. I'll be right back. - What's up?
- I think they're gonna break up.
- Who?
- My mom and my dad.
I didn't notice until I came home for the summer, but it's really bad, Uncle Peter.
I mean, one minute, Mom seems okay. The next, she's crying and locks herself in the bedroom.
Dad won't even say anything.
He just gets all quiet and stares into space.
- Look, they lost their son. It's normal.
- No, it is not normal.
They fight all the time about her job, about Jesse's room.
Dad washed a shirt that had his scent on it, and Mom went nuts.
And then Dad stayed out all night. I don't know. It's just messed up.
Somebody's gotta talk to her.
There's nothing I can say, and there's nothing you can do but give it time.
- It's almost been a year, Uncle Peter.
- Joanie, I know, but it-
- Trauma 1?
It's your patient.
- My patient?
- Yeah, the girl from the talk show.
What?
Probably a tension pneumo.
- What happened?
- Four-story fall. GCS of three. In P.E.A.
- How'd she fall? - She jumped.
Pulse ox, 74 on 100 percent.
- Did she ever have a pulse? - No.
- Try for a central line.
- Let's open up another tray first. We've got this.
Go get cleaned up.
- Prep for a subclavian.
- Not until I get a second chest tube.
Really, Kerry.
We've got it.
- Set up a Thora-Seal.
- Holding compressions. - Pretty agonal.
You want atropine?
- Yeah.
Push a milligram.
Let's set up a pericardiocentesis.
- What did you say to her? - I didn't say anything to her.
Check the tamponade.
Give her 8 units packed cells.
- I feel a pulse.
- Injury occurring on the monitor.
Blood in the pericardium.
220 cc's out. - Rate is 29.
- Still no pulse.
All right.
Resuming compressions.
Another amp of epi.
- Mother's outside. - Keep her out.
- I'll tell her.
- I'm not ready to call it yet.
You will be.
Let it circulate.
Dr. Benton?
Asystole.
No!
No!
Time of death, 12:17.
- Peter.
- Hey. - Hi.
- What, are you spring-cleaning?
- Getting rid of some crap.
- It's not too dark?
I wanted to finish. Salvation Army comes tomorrow.
- All right. Well, let me give you a hand.
- I'm almost done.
Want a hamster cage?
- No?
- You okay?
What did you need, Peter? I
- What? I just came by for a snow shovel.
All right.
I came to check on you.
I heard you lost your job.
We'll just have to wait to expand that porch.
What's wrong with the porch?
I don't know.
I thought it was time for a change.
Walt took some pictures of the back yard that we could xerox and draw on make plans.
When I went to pick up the prints I found three pictures of Jesse left on the roll.
I fell apart.
Right in the store.
I realized that's it.
There'll never be any more pictures of him.
Fifteen years old.
And he's never gonna change.
You think every day you're getting a little better, getting through it.
And then you're right back to the day it happened.
He's still my baby, Peter.
I'm supposed to take care of him.
I feel like somewhere, sometime he's gonna be sad or cold or scared.
Who's taking care of him?
Who's being his mother?
"I am the resurrection and the life," sayeth the Lord.
"He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
We brought nothing into this world.
And it is certain we'd carry nothing out.
Wherefore my heart is glad and my spirit rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope. "
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ we commend to almighty God our brother John.
And we commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust.
Dad did a nice job with the eulogy.
He worked on it for a while.
- Grandpa would have liked it. - Yes.
Gamma seems to be holding up.
I expect she would.
Is that for your convenience or someone else's?
- Hello. - Bad time?
Yeah.
Kind of busy. Why?
Wait, wait. She's not on the ward?
Weisman was supposed to admit her last night.
- She's sitting right here.
- What's her hemoglobin?
Okay, yeah. No, I'll be right there.
Fifteen minutes.
We need to make a stop at County General Hospital.
- Just get off on Division.
- Yes, sir.
This shouldn't take long.
You mind?
- Can someone shut him up? - Why don't you both shut up.
I got a right to be here, same as you.
Hi.
- You left without saying goodbye.
- You were asleep.
- For about 10 minutes. - I'm sorry.
I had someplace to be.
- I don't like it here. - I know.
But we'll make sure that you get your own bed and your own room upstairs.
- You said that last night.
- Well, they're still working on it.
- But I'm gonna go hurry them up, okay?
- Okay.
Any more pain in your stomach?
- A little.
- We'll take care of that.
And Abby here is gonna hang out with you until they bring you up.
Tell her to call me again if you want to talk to me.
- Thanks for coming back. - You're welcome.
What was her last crit?
Thirty-six, after two doses of Solu-Medrol.
Give her four more, MS, then Q2 p. r. n.
- When are her parents getting here?
- Around 3.
- They missed their connecting flight.
- Dr. Weisman, please.
Nice suit. Who died?
My grandfather.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
No, no.
Can you get him on the phone now?
- When did he die?
- It's Dr. Carter in the ER.
- Monday. - Wow.
You okay?
I'm off at 4 if you want to go get a coffee or something.
I got 200 people back at the house.
There's coffee there, isn't there?
I wouldn't ask you to subject yourself to that.
Dr. Weisman? This is Dr. Carter.
You have a patient, Holly Evans, who was supposed to be admitted last night.
Wait.
- Thank you.
- Did the driver get lost?
John had something more pressing.
It was trouble with a patient.
- Decent turnout.
- It'll do.
- Where's Gamma? - Lying down.
Said she was tired.
- Where are you staying?
- The Drake.
The Ritz-Carlton was booked.
Did you think about staying here?
Oh, there's Peter Harkins. I should say hello.
- Who's Peter Harkins?
- He's handling the probate.
I'm gonna check on Gamma.
- I did. She's fine.
- Still-
You want to help your grandmother, be a good host.
Introduce yourself to Senator Herrero's daughter.
Arthur.
Dr. Carter, your friend is here.
- Holly got her bed. - Yeah?
Did Weisman come down?
Yeah.
A few minutes after you called.
Amazing what a little "pull your thumb out" will do.
- Did you eat something?
- No.
I couldn't decide between the smoked tongue pâté and the whitefish mousse.
We must have run out of the pigs-in-the-blanket.
Well, somebody should really talk to your caterer.
You're gonna have some dirty birds.
Grandpa liked to drive the power lawn mower around.
- And he drove it into the birdbath?
- Not on purpose.
He was having a fatal Ml at the time.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
You gotta die somehow.
It's not a bad way to go.
A sunny day out on the mower.
- Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't laugh.
- Well, stop it.
Oh, God.
I hope it's all right that I came here.
I'm not usually a funeral crasher.
Figured this would be a good one?
And I felt bad that your grandfather died and we didn't even talk about it.
John, have you seen Millicent?
No.
Mom, this is my friend Abby.
Abby, this is my mother, Eleanor.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Things are winding down. She really needs to make an appearance.
- I will go and look for her in a minute.
Sorry.
- It's okay.
- It's my parents. They don't...
They don't handle loss well.
Who does?
It's been a while since we've had to deal with this sort of thing.
Since your brother died?
You'd better go.
54. That was back in July.
Oh, come on.
fall from grace for the NASDAQ.
- John? - Hey.
- Is everything okay?
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.
Have you seen Gamma?
Haven't given up that quest, huh?
Oh, Mom thinks she might be hiding out.
I don't blame her.
That room can get insufferable.
Dad, I think you should stay here tonight.
Don't worry. We have a driver.
No. I meant for Gamma.
- You know how your mom feels about it.
- Well, then stand up to her this time.
Thanks for the counsel.
I'll take it under advisement.
She buried her husband today.
Yes, I know.
My father.
- Then don't run away again.
- Drop it, John.
Leave it alone.
I've left it alone.
Bobby's not coming back.
If Mom wants to walk around in a bubble for the rest of her life, fine. But don't let her keep holding you inside of it.
You might want to try the garage.
Damn it.
- Gamma?
- I can't get this stupid thing started.
Well, it sounds like it's flooded.
You need to let it sit.
- Your mother sent you.
- Yeah.
- People want to pay their respects.
- Well, they can wait.
I'm the widow.
I hope you weren't thinking about drinking and driving.
We were saving that bottle for our 60th anniversary.
Missed it by a year.
Open it.
No, you can still wait.
Let's drink to your grandfather.
It's a very nice vintage.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather share this with-?
We don't have any glasses.
You can drink from the bottle.
To John Truman Carter entrepreneur philanthropist family man.
And friend.
We gonna take this old girl out for a spin, or what?
Damn right.
Okay, that's it.
- How'd it look?
- Have to wait for the radiologist.
You saw it.
- I'm just a tech.
- Did you see anything bad?
- You want to take on Fossen, Mark?
- What? The shooter.
He coded in the elevator.
I thought maybe you should present him in MM.
Yeah, sure. Whatever.
- Did you give nitro?
- Two sprays, no relief.
Can you see if they brought my daughter?
I think she broke her arm.
- Is this from the talk show?
- How'd you guess?
- They're stacked up in the waiting room.
- How'd it start?
How do any of them start?
I heard somebody bit the host this time.
- So I only present the cab driver.
- Luka, relax, okay?
Just stick to the facts. You'll be fine.
Cleo, check a 12-lead and a-
The meds?
Third time today.
- You tried Compazine? - Yeah.
- We can get you some Zofran.
- I can live with the nausea.
- My liver enzymes were up last week.
- Meds might be giving you hepatitis.
Only one more week.
- Three out of four might be enough.
- Maybe.
- You don't want to hurt your liver.
- I want to be safe.
- Malucci, need something to do?
- No. I'm swamped, actually.
- Want my opinion?
- I guess so.
Reduce your dose and monitor your LFTs.
- Talk show? - No. Casey Square.
A bunch of teenagers beat him up for his coin cup.
Trauma 2.
Contusions to the face, chest, everything.
- Didn't anybody see this happening?
- The whole plaza saw it.
All right.
Get a surgical consult and x-ray. I'll be right there.
- Nobody did anything?
- Just his homeless buddies.
- Hi, Adele.
- Hi.
- How's physical therapy?
- It's hard.
- Have you got up on crutches?
- Yeah, with leg braces, yeah.
- That's a good sign.
- Well, I'm trying.
But I'm also realistic.
Romano wanted me to go to Morbidity and Mortality as a show-and-tell.
- Are you presenting Fossen?
- Y eah.
Well, have fun.
- I need an ultrasound.
- Coming.
C- spine's ready.
- Did you get his pressure up?
-90/60 after a liter.
Hi, it's Abby calling about your colitis patient, Holly.
She keeps asking for you.
Could you call me? Thanks.
Everything hurts.
Okay, we can take the collar off now.
- How'd it go?
- What?
Oh, right. Good.
Yeah. Still have a brain.
- Mark.
- Everything's normal.
I still can't believe people would stand there and watch someone get beaten.
- How are you holding up? - Six weeks maternity leave, not enough.
We have fluid in Morrison's pouch. Call O.R.
- Where?
- There.
- It appears you're bleeding internally-
- It could be ascites from cirrhosis.
I can't assume that.
- What's his blood alcohol?
-315. When was your last drink, Mr. Skapinski?
They took my last drink.
- He's hypotensive with a low crit.
- He could be septic from pneumonia.
- High risk for surgery.
- Even riskier if he bleeds out.
Let's take a deep breath and do a peritoneal lavage.
- He's a surgical candidate.
- A homeless alcoholic with pneumonia.
Therefore not worth saving?
He's as healthy as he'll get. I'm trying to keep him that way.
- Surgery could kill him.
- Delaying surgery could kill him.
Say he doesn't die on the table or in post-op.
You ship him back to his convenience-store alley.
But this time, instead of getting beaten up he gets eaten by dogs because he's too weak to move.
- Eaten by dogs?
- It happens.
- In Chicago?
- A lot. A cop told me.
Dr. Romano needs to speak to you in his office immediately.
- Did he say why?
- Something about the Fossen case.
He says it's important.
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.
MMs.
They serve their purpose in the practice of medicine, I guess.
- But they can be a pain in the ass.
- Needed something, Robert?
I hear you're presenting this serial killer.
- Mass murderer?
- Right, right. This Fossen guy.
- You don't want me to?
- No.
It's just that Legal flagged something. I wanted you to be prepared for the question.
Sure.
Go ahead.
It's no big deal.
It's their job to be anal.
Yeah. What is it?
Well, the nurse's notes show that you left the Trauma Room at 1625.
And the code-blue notes from pre-op began at 1642.
Why'd it take you 17 minutes to transfer a patient up four floors?
Well...
I- Dr. Romano, there's an incident in the ambulance bay.
I'm in a meeting, Brenda.
An ER patient jumped out a fourth-floor window.
That's great news, Brenda, thank you.
Are they dead? I don't know. They're working on her.
Keep the press away.
No statements from anyone to anyone and get Risk Management down there.
Why I wanted this job I will never know.
All right, Greene, let's go.
As you can see, I've got bigger fish to fry.
Doors opened on the surgical floor.
I was alone doing chest compressions, ran down the defib battery.
Took time to get help transfer the patient to pre-op.
Okey-doke.
Brenda, get PR on the line.
- Is that it?
- Yeah. I don't think anyone's gonna be crying over this guy.
Autopsy revealed injuries to the spleen and superior mesenteric artery.
Cause of death: exsanguination from multiple vascular injuries.
Why wasn't lidocaine given for stable V-tach?
I didn't have the ACLS drug box with me.
When transferring a critical patient?
The Trauma nurse ran out to get it, but then the doors closed unexpectedly.
- Leaving you alone with the patient?
I don't know if it would have changed the outcome.
I'm sorry. Did you say the original dysrhythmia was stable V-tach?
Yes.
He had a pulse?
That's correct.
- So the patient was conscious?
I didn't realize that.
Were you involved with this case, Dr. Corday?
No.
No. Wait a minute.
You cardioverted a patient without sedation?
- Yes.
- Isn't that a little barbaric?
Under the circumstances, it's what I felt I needed to do.
Was there any delay in the O.R. accepting the patient?
Dr. Greene?
No.
Did you know him?
- Who? - His grandfather.
Yeah. I met him at that charity event.
Charity event?
Abby, where's my patient?
Dr. Corday took him up to surgery.
- I thought you okayed it.
- Yeah. - So you're going?
- Yeah.
- Mrs. Jenkins. - Could you take this tube out?
They wouldn't take this tube out.
This is a coroner's case.
I'm sorry, we have to wait.
They flew us to Chicago and put us up in the Hilton gave me money to go shopping with.
The producers said not to tell her until after the taping.
That it would be more real if she didn't know what I was gonna say.
It was a lie.
It was all a lie.
All that stuff about them having the same daddies I just said that to get them on the show.
I used to say, "Alice, you must always tell the truth. "
And she'd go, "Well, why, Mommy? "
And I'd say:
"Because when you don't God gets very angry. "
How is she?
Catherine said she slept for three hours this afternoon.
- Has she fed?
How's our patient?
Extubated in Recovery when I left.
I repaired a little omental oozing.
But it might have stopped on its own.
It's hard to say. Judgment call.
You do what you think is right, Mark.
Elizabeth, in the elevator with Fossen-
I think we've talked enough about Fossen today, don't you?
I'm going to bed.
You coming? Just wait a few minutes.
Make sure she's down.
Okay.
- Good night.
Night-night, sweetheart.
Mark I'll get up with her.
Okay.
That you need to start setting priorities and making some hard choices.
The Phoenix Suns.
Is that a crime?
- You root for the Phoenix Suns? - I paid attention to basketball there.
- You grew up in Chicago.
- I dated a guy with tickets.
- You didn't pay attention to the Bulls?
- Whatever. I'm starving.
Big Diamondbacks fan too, aren't you?
- I'm gonna get breakfast out of this deal.
- Sorry.
My manners. - Roach coach?
- You live in a mansion...
- ... you're buying me a doughnut?
- I'll spring for the coffee too.
- Hello.
- John, it's Dad.
- Hey. How was your flight?
- How's Gamma doing?
Yeah.
No, she was walking around a little bit yesterday.
- Great. - I meet her for lunch.
- You wanna hook up there?
- You're getting me a yogurt too.
What's that?
Grab me a bagel.
- ...for the holiday.
- Really.
- No, that's great.
- See you at the house.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll see you there.
- They' re staying for the holidays.
- Your parents?
First time in nine years.
- Just like sex, isn't it, Peter?
- What? Vascular surgery. Messy, fun, and when done right, you leave satisfied.
D5 half-normal, 125 cc's per hour.
- Surgery.
- Real good hands in there, Peter.
Thank you. Which is why you get to assist me in the Millburn surgery.
Fifth District alderman wants his cardiac bypass done here.
Why? The correct response is, "Thanks, Dr. Romano.
I'm honored."
- I am-
- Clear his calendar for Monday afternoon.
- I need to talk.
- He's on trauma call in the ER. Dump that on Corday.
She actually likes it down there.
- I have a situation with my son.
- What else is new? - I need more flexible hours.
- In by 12, out by 4... and we all make the evening news.
I'm not just talking about this surgery. If you're not interested, Peter, pass.
I've got 20 guys who'd kill for this gig.
- I didn't say I wasn't interested-
- I'm in.
Merry Christmas!
- Feed the poor? Feed the poor? - Sorry.
- Hey, feed the poor?
- Sorry.
Come on. You think it's easy being a female Santa in a man's world?
Sorry, no soliciting. You have to leave the premises.
- I work for the Salvation Army.
- Oh, do you?
Let me see your ID.
- Okay, I eat at the Salvation Army.
- Get out of here.
Hey! I'm gonna call the cops. Stop ringing that damn bell!
- Luka, you're late.
Don't be sorry, be punctual.
This is a hospital, not a department store.
When's she going on Christmas vacation?
Scrooge?
Never.
Merry Christmas.
County General.
I think she thinks you were shopping.
Shopping for what?
It's a joke.
What's going on?
I went to the bar.
No one's heard anything.
- About Nicole?
- Yeah. They said she took money there too.
Guess you were right.
She lied about everything.
Hey, Abby. Can you run Cynthia Cohen's sputum?
I got a couple of kids with snow-related injuries!
Quiet! - Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak-
- Hey! Shut up! Both of you, shut up!
Be glad you're not sleeping in a grate or eating out of the trash!
- Haleh, get them out of here.
- Stop! - You, this side. You, over here.
- Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak...
Since when did Fire and Rescue start transporting pediatric walk-in cases?
Since these two took headers out by the firehouse.
- You notify the parents?
- Yeah, I left word.
- Hey, you didn't call.
- Sorry? About getting together. You change your mind?
- No, I was just-
- Dr. Weaver, Exam 1 has chest pains.
- Be right there.
- Dynamic changes on the EKG.
I'll let you get back to work, okay?
Three nitro sprays and titrate six of morphine.
Cops found him wandering around O'Hare with a suitcase but no ticket and no ID.
He fell on the escalator trying to get away.
I'm missing my flight.
Lacerations down to the galea.
I go home for Christmas every year, I think.
- Looks intact.
No sign of fracture.
- Which doesn't explain the amnesia.
Doesn't know who he is, where he's going.
I know there's lots of kids around. And the women make a wonderful supper.
Blood supply looks good.
Well, Plastics should be able to tack it back down.
We still need to get a head CT.
Boys and the men, they settle around the TV watching sports.
You think his memory loss is temporary?
Peter?
He's 4 years old.
And deaf and traumatized by the death of his mother.
- I emphasized all of that.
Thank you. - Well, then appeal it.
- I can't.
- What am I paying you for?
He denied the motion, Peter.
It's not irreparable.
The hell it isn't. He's asking my son to decide which of us loves him more?
It won't be that specific.
Will he ask who makes better macaroni and cheese?
Judge Alter has a feeling that interviewing Reece will provide relevant insight.
Reece knows what's going on. He can sense it.
How much more damage do you want to inflict on him?
Hey, I agreed to represent you. You're the one who's choosing to fight.
You can preempt this. His attorney approached me yesterday.
- No. - They'll make a revised visitation request.
I said, no.
And I need to be honest.
We don't have the edge here.
On paper, Roger comes across as the better father.
If I were his attorney, I would advise him to give you no more deals.
Yet you're advising me to accept one?
I am advising you to at least listen to one.
- You're still here.
- I was on my way out.
Keep those kids from killing each other?
Yeah. One has a corneal abrasion the other has a strained wrist. Look, hey...
- I'm not very good at this.
- What, follow-up?
Want to have lunch tomorrow?
- No sushi.
- What? - I don't like sushi.
- Okay.
Anything you want.
I'm gonna remember you said that.
Why is he here? Somebody finally kick his butt?
- Who? - Mr. Karaoke over there.
- How about a little "Jingle Bell Rock"?
- You know him?
Oh, yeah, Stan? He lives behind a dumpster on 57th and Dorchester.
- He's homeless?
- Unless you count the dumpster.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Where you going?
- Whatever that lady told you, it's not true.
- Your name isn't Stan?
- No, no, no. - You don't live at 57th and Dorchester?
- I don't remember. That's why I'm here.
Besides, this Stan character sounds rough.
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- And no family to speak of.
- No place to spend the holidays.
- You know, if he was smart he'd clean himself up, get himself a suit at the Goodwill-
And go to the airport.
You mind if I stay a while?
It's kind of Christmassy here.
The alderman thinks you're such a brilliant surgeon, then you operate.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
Hey. What's going on?
- Waiting for Roger and his lawyer.
- I thought we were seeing the judge.
- We're hoping that won't be necessary.
- Peter, what's going on?
- They wanna talk about some kind of deal. - Sorry we're late.
We ran into traffic. We don't have a lot of time.
What have you got? Visitation every other weekend, plus two weeks during the summer.
- One week during the summer.
- No. - We're only asking for 38 days a year.
-31 days.
- I said, no.
- Peter, it's only 31 days.
- I'm not doing this.
- Peter, listen to me.
No. You listen to me, all of you.
I'm not negotiating over my son.
Rather take your chances with the judge?
A martini in first class works just as well and takes less time.
Like you, I enjoy the occasional drive.
Gives you time to clear your head.
- Hey, Dad.
- John. Did you know your father's been here since last night?
Late last night.
He went straight to the hotel.
- Oh, God. Am I dying?
- Rigor mortis hasn't set in just yet.
Why else would my son deign to spend Christmas with us?
Mom's coming too.
- I knew there was a catch.
- Eleanor will be here later this week.
You'll stay at the house until then?
Sure, why not. Wonderful. Here's Helga to turn me like a pancake.
- We'll give you some privacy.
- I'd settle for a little dignity.
Believe it or not, she's thrilled.
This means the world to her.
- This year more than most.
- Well, I suppose. Means a lot to me too.
Yeah. It should be fun, huh?
Reece, I have to make a decision.
I need you to help me by answering some questions. Can you do that?
Who's that?
Daddy.
And who's that?
My other daddy.
You love both your daddies very much, right?
He says he doesn't know.
When you are sick, who makes you feel better?
Mommy.
Which daddy gives you the best care when you get a boo-boo?
He has Band-Aids with cartoons.
Right now, I'd say he needs consistency.
Reece, Carla and I. The three of us were a family.
That's how we planned our lives.
That's how we approached every day, every week.
I've been with Reece through earaches flus, almost every scrape he's ever gotten.
If you count the hours that I've spent with my stepson it far exceeds the time Dr. Benton has spent with the child he believed to be his.
Reece and Carla were my life.
And now Reece is my life.
He comes first.
Ahead of my personal needs, ahead of my job.
And I think that's in his best interest.
- Oh, John.
Diverse selection.
- Burgers are good.
You already know what you want? I'm still working on what to drink.
This is nice. Haven't done this for a while.
Had lunch together? Or Christmas?
Both.
So...
What kind of business keeps Mom in Costa Rica in December?
How's the chopped salad?
She broke her hip, Dad.
Mom can't spend five minutes with her?
Is she gonna avoid her for the whole month?
Your mother's not coming.
John, we're getting divorced.
- What?
Divorced?
- It's amicable.
After 30 years?
- What happened?
- This probably isn't the best-
- Is there somebody else?
- Neither of us is running off with anyone.
What is it, she's not happy?
She's bored?
Wants to stay in Europe?
I'm the one who's leaving, John.
This can't surprise you. You saw it before I did.
- Can I take your order? - I was suffocating.
I think we're ready.
Chopped salad, please.
Burger medium-rare, please.
I agree with Mr. McGrath that consistency is the best thing for Reece right now.
See, I... I let Carla take on a lot of the parenting while I pursued my career.
But I did that because it felt right to leave Reece in his mother's care.
But all that's changed now.
And my responsibilities have changed too.
Because of that I've made arrangements to work fewer hours so I can become Reece's full-time caretaker.
- At County General?
- Yes, sir.
What sort of hour reduction are we talking about?
7 a. m. to 5 p. m. weekdays, weekends off.
You can provide proof of this new schedule?
Yes, sir.
Yes, I can.
Have it in my office by day's end.
Unless there is anything else, court's adjourned.
I need to talk to him now.
Well, pull him out.
Fine. Let him know I'm on my way.
- Going back to work?
- Get out of my way.
- Got another shift?
- Roger, get out of my way!
Where's Reece?
Let me guess: Jackie. No, Cleo.
A nanny?
- You want me to hit your car?
- You lied, man.
On top of everything else, you're a liar. And a perjurer.
You know what? You need to back off.
Whatever it takes, is that it?
He's not a trophy, man!
You can't win at any cost to give your sister a son!
- You gotta raise him! - You know-
Go ahead, get in my face.
Come on.
- Roger, you need to shut your mouth.
- Think, Peter.
You can't change who you are.
I'm sure it was on this block. It's called Nazim. It's got a blue awning.
- Well, I don't see it.
- We must have missed it.
- I don't like Indian food anyway.
- Why didn't you say something?
- I just did.
- Why don't we go to that Italian place...
- ... across the street.
Great risotto. - Wait a minute.
- That'd be great if it weren't closed.
- You're a pain in the ass, you know that?
- Well, some say.
- I'm starting to regret this whole thing. - Too bad.
I'm starving.
- Forget about looking for a decent place.
- Why don't we go home and order in.
- I like a take-charge kind of girl.
- My apartment?
- Lead the way.
- Dr. Romano.
- You hear something?
- I need to talk to you.
- That's a doctor who breaks promises then hangs up on the guy he breaks the promises with.
- I need to talk to you now.
- Talk is cheap, Peter.
I need to scale back my hours and I need it in writing.
- "To whom it may concern:
- I'm serious.
- Is this about your kid?
What do you need?
Every other Saturday?
No nights. No weekends.
Good one. I like the one about the rabbi and the goldfish.
- I need to spend more time at home.
- Never needed to before.
- His mother died.
- His stepfather is still alive.
Split custody, keep doing what you do best.
I'm not asking for your advice.
News flash!
This is an urban trauma center.
Until people plan their MVAs and GSWs better, you won't punch a time clock.
That's not me being a hard-ass, that's the job.
You are a surgeon.
- Are you gonna do this for me or not?
- Not. Work when I need you or not at all.
Then consider this my resignation.
All right, all right, all right.
Don't go getting dramatic.
- Weekends off.
- And what about weekdays?
It's my best offer, Peter. Take it or leave it.
I'll finish out the week.
Are you really gonna do this? Throw away your career to play Mr. Mom?
What a waste!
- Hi.
- Hey. Newborn for the nursery.
- Birth in the ER?
- Marshall Field's. Mother was last-minute shopping. She's on her way up.
- The paramedics delivered?
- No, a shoe salesman.
- Room 424, do you have a chart?
- Was she an ER patient?
I just have to follow up on something.
- How far along was she?
- Eight weeks.
No complications.
- She's in Recovery for a few more hours.
- Dr. Finch, please.
- I'm not sure she's here.
Let me check. All right, thanks.
- What are you doing here?
- I need to meet the Surgicenter director.
- You gave him my CV, right?
- Yeah, but-
- I quit County.
- Romano wouldn't give you the hours?
You said there's a position here.
I want it.
- I'll introduce you tomorrow.
- I gotta show proof of employment now.
- Peter, he's probably gone for the day.
- Check, please.
- I just started, he barely knows me.
- Cleo, I need to talk to him.
- Hi.
I thought you left.
- Tonight.
Luka has been looking for you.
Could you wait, please?
- Do you need something?
- You told him you weren't pregnant.
- I'm not.
- I don't understand.
You don't need to.
- Look, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- No, you were right.
He did everything he could.
I thought his kindness was love. But it's not.
Abby, he deserves not to know.
Thanks.
Tuesday's impossible.
He's got colorectal procedures then. Fissurectomy at 7. Hemorrhoidectomy at 8.
Another at 9. And it looks like he's squeezed in an inguinal hernia too.
- Maybe for lunch?
- No, he's got a lunch date.
- After that?
- After that, he sees patients until 5.
- How about Thursday?
- Thursday might work, actually.
Judge Alter!
Judge Alter!
I got that employment letter for you.
- I wanted this yesterday.
- I know. It came in after-hours.
- This is not your hospital. - No.
- Schaumburg Surgicenter?
- I worked out... a better situation there than if I had stayed at County.
- All in the last 12 hours?
- It was always a possibility.
- It just needed to be ironed out.
- You didn't mention it yesterday. I know.
I said I'd cut back my hours and I did.
- I'm now working 8 to 5, no weekends.
- This letter confirms it. - That may be so.
But you told a different story yesterday. And I don't like being lied to.
I'm doing what I have to do for my son.
Hey, Elizabeth.
You sneaking coffee? Tea.
You look nice.
Are you going on a date?
No. Court date.
- Right.
What's the latest?
- It's out of my hands now.
It's best to keep busy while you wait.
Yeah. Well, I owe a lot of hours before I go.
- Before you go? - Yeah.
End of the week, I'm out of here.
- What?
- Yeah, I had to quit.
- You're not serious.
- I need to change my life. Romano won't cut me any slack.
Yeah, but I'm sure he'll make some accommodation. No.
I asked. He won't.
You'd really leave County?
I gotta go.
- How'd he fall?
- Hanging lights.
Parents are signing him in.
- What do we got?
- Fell from a ladder.
- Parents are here.
- Is he okay?
- Has he been unconscious?
- His sister put the hose on him.
- He woke up for a second.
- Did he hit anything? - A bike.
- I got some involuntary guarding here.
- He's waking up.
That's good, yes?
- Coming through.
- What do we have?
- Possible liver or splenic lac.
- Stable, but might need to go to the O.R.
- HemoCue?
- Second is eight from 10.
- Does your belly hurt?
All right. He's stable for CT.
Control the pain.
- Watch him overnight.
- He has free fluid by ultrasound.
I won't remove the spleen before we have to. - Remove?
- He can still live without one.
- I can give him mine.
- That's not necessary.
- Someone'll match.
- We don't transplant spleens.
- I'll show you where the waiting room is.
- We can at least give blood.
- She's going down. - Amparo!
Ma'am, you okay?
- Have you fainted before? - Never.
How do you serve Christmas dinner for them?
Start cooking early.
No problem.
O.R.'s got elective cases they can push.
How's she doing?
Please, I'm fine.
Tell me about Ben.
His blood counts are stable, that's good.
His first CT only shows a small injury.
His school band plays in a concert on New Year's Eve.
I don't want him to miss it.
- How long have you had this node?
- I don't know.
Is this tender?
You don't have to examine me or run tests.
I know I'm sick.
Have you been diagnosed with something?
Lymphoma.
I'm sorry.
- Don't tell them, though.
- Your family doesn't know?
There will be plenty of time to talk after Christmas.
Dr. Benton?
Janice Prager called. She wants you to meet her in court. - Go.
I'll get another surgeon.
- Your son will be fine.
Good.
- They got me right in the store.
- It's tough to hide two pairs of skates.
The guard jumped me in front of my kids.
Can we keep the ice skates? No.
They hate getting used stuff.
I thought for Christmas-
They wanna take you to the station house.
I know.
Do you have someone to stay with them?
Their mother?
I'll be right back. Abby?
- Are you gonna be in jail for Christmas?
- I don't know.
Maybe I should post bail for him.
They have no money.
Do you know where they've been living?
In a motel room.
- Probably can't pay a security deposit.
- No, he has a job. But it's $5. 15 an hour.
He has to steal to get his kids a decent Christmas present.
Could call the food bank.
No, they help out this time of year.
What happens to them in three months?
There's only so much you can do.
Yeah, I guess.
I just...
Miss your kids?
Sorry.
It's worse at Christmas.
- Where's the judge?
- In chambers.
- Gentlemen, your counsel with you?
- They're on the way.
While we wait for Ms. Prager and Mr. Wharton I was wondering if I could talk with Reece once more.
- Only if you both agree, of course.
- Sure.
- I don't see why not. - Thank you.
Nancy, will you ask him to come with me?
It's okay.
It's okay. Go, go.
Just Reece this time.
He'll have exploratory surgery. They'll repair any injuries he might have.
- He'll be home for the holidays?
- Wait and see how he does.
So we celebrate a day or two late.
It doesn't matter. Thank you, doctor!
- Did you get him upstairs?
- Along with his parents, aunts, cousins...
Hope they all fit in the waiting room.
You ready for this?
God. I forgot.
I mean, I didn't forget. It's at home, yours.
I don't know where my head is at, though.
Do you wanna open it anyway?
- Can we wait?
- Sure.
Sorry.
Is something wrong?
- I'm having family problems.
- Your grandma?
No, no.
It's my mother.
She's not coming home for the holidays.
She and my father are splitting up.
- Oh, no.
- I don't think it's sunk in yet.
- Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
- How do you figure?
- Did you ever meet my parents?
- I met Cookie.
Right. She and Henry aren't divorced, and they should be.
- Still, I'm sorry. - Thanks.
I'm so self-centered. I thought it was something to do with me.
No. You're about the only thing going right in my life.
- You shouldn't let this happen.
- Didn't want to be defensive.
- What did he think of your new job?
- He wasn't overly impressed.
There you are.
Thank you for all rushing over.
Be seated.
We are in a unique situation.
In a traditional custody case, win or lose the parents maintain the title given to them by their biology.
They're still Mommy and Daddy.
Here I'm asked to declare that one of these two men is not, in fact, Daddy.
But they both love Reece and have made sacrifices to be with him though I will say Dr. Benton's effort was late in the game.
And I am uncomfortable about the way he handled it.
Not convinced he was exactly forthright with the court.
But the fact is that I do believe Reece would thrive in either of your households.
And that makes my decision even harder.
But based on the evidence provided by Dr. Benton that he will be more available as a parent in the future and the fact that Reece has always believed him to be his father the court grants custody to Peter Benton.
Mr. McGrath will be given visitation with Reece every other Saturday.
The court calls a 20-minute recess.
We might have to go get one.
- Use the angel.
- No, I always have a star.
Okay, here we go.
One, two, three.
Yes, it is pretty. You finish your part?
Hey, baby. Come here. Come over here.
Come lay under the tree.
- You should get going.
- I got a half an hour.
- Going to be late for your last shift.
- What are they gonna do? Fire me?
- What are we doing?
- It's the best way to look at a tree.
When I was Reece's age, I used to do this for hours.
- It's beautiful. - Yeah.
Hey, how long is the commute to Schaumburg?
- Depends on when you leave.
- I was thinking, if we both work there...
Maybe we should relocate.
We?
This whole thing has made me focus.
It's like all my life I've been chasing something.
That time when I can make it into the end zone and spike the ball.
It took almost losing my son to realize the end zone's not out there.
It's right here.
You're good raw material. I can work with you.
- Oh, you can?
- Yeah. I have to get you in shape.
What kind of shape?
- Hey, you found it.
- I knew it was in one of those boxes.
Want to put it up there? All right, come on.
That's good.
- I'm working New Year's Eve?
- Someone has to. - Someone else.
- Six-year-old, GSW.
- Please save him.
- What happened?
.38 caliber, right thorax, crossed the midline.
- Vitals? - BP, 70/30.
Pulse, 130.
He's so pale.
You his mother?
What's his name?
- What's his name? - Teddy.
Decreased breath sounds. Full trauma panel. He needs a chest tube.
- It's the two of us.
- How did it happen?
I shot him.
I guess I should say congratulations.
Did you really get a new job?
You gonna call me a liar again?
- Here you are, Christmas Eve.
- Yeah, well, it's my last shift.
What's your excuse?
I wanted to give you Reece's Christmas presents.
You can leave them over there.
- See you in two Saturdays. - Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
Hey, Roger.
Come over to the house tomorrow and give them to him yourself.
Thanks.
I'm not doing it for you.
Surgery.
Dr. Benton, the ER.
- Sux on board.
- Our tree's by the window.
-51/2 ET tube.
- There've been so many break-ins.
- O-neg's running. Systolic's at 70.
- Call for a vent.
- I was sleeping. I had the flu.
-10 blade.
- He was supposed to be in bed.
- Long vascular clamp.
He dropped an ornament. I thought someone was breaking in.
I'm in. Bag him.
- GSW?
-6-year-old accidentally shot by his mom.
Heart rate's down to 30.
- Lost his pulse. Starting compressions.
- Thoracotomy tray.
- What does that mean?
- We'll open his chest, repair the damage.
- Four more units of blood.
- Scalpel.
- Oh, God!
- Paula, come with me.
500 cc's out the right side.
- Ready with the rib-spreader.
- Suction on high.
All right.
Hang on, hang on.
Crank it now. Come on.
- Looks like two liters in there.
- Damn it.
Pericardium's filled with blood. 15 blade.
Call the O.R. We got a red blanket. Page Romano.
- Who shoots a 6-year-old?
- Thought he was a burglar.
- A burglar who shakes presents?
-10 blade.
- I'll clamshell the chest.
- Sternal saw.
- We really going through the motions?
- Knife back. Metz.
- Guess we are. - Pick-ups. Come on, pick-ups!
Damn it.
Here's a fragment of the slug.
- Looks weird. - Saw.
Let's move.
- It's a Black Talon. Fragmenting bullet.
- Fragments at the hilum.
- Looks like razor blades all over him. - That's the point.
- Order more FFP? - On its way.
Lost cause.
Fragments in all chambers.
God knows what hit the great vessels.
- Dr. Corday is here.
- She'll love being brought in on this.
- What do we have?
- Organ donor.
- BP dropping, 60/30.
- Hang two more units packed cells.
- He'll go into DIC.
- We'll stay ahead with cryo and platelets.
We've got other surgeries.
Looks like a transverse colon injury and dead bowel.
I'm still in the chest.
Repaired defects to the left ventricle and right hilum.
- Hope you brought your magic wand.
- Help me or get the hell out.
Knock yourself out, Peter.
Either way, you're gone.
We need to rebuild the IVC from the kidneys caudally.
More 2-0 silk on a Teflon pledget.
Come on.
Keep them coming.
Elizabeth, we can do this, all right?
Prep a venous cardiac snare.
Did I kill him?
We don't know what his chances are.
But he does have the best surgeons I know working on him.
How could I do this?
You were scared.
I keep telling God how sorry I am.
That's all you can do.
I don't even believe in God.
Teddy never gets up from bed.
I just wanted to protect our home. I never thought he'd...
You want me to take you to the O.R.?
- Turn off the damn heat.
- Another Vicryl.
- Gl stapler.
- Not much stool in the abdominal cavity.
- Good sign.
I expected more.
- Gut's done.
What's the pressure?
-80/40.
- Well, that's something.
- Let me get another clip.
- Not much.
Here we go.
SMV is done.
Cut.
Shirley, take down the balloon on the Pruitt.
- Here we go.
Catheter out.
- Balloon down.
Throw in a good knot, see if he stops bleeding.
Come on, Teddy.
Come on, man. Come on.
Look at that.
- Yeah.
- That's incredible.
Yeah.
Well, all right. Here we go.
Releasing the clamp.
- How the hell did you do that?
- I have no idea.
Let's make sure of the count.
- Is that the mother?
- Yeah.
- You go tell her.
I'll close up.
- Okay.
Thanks, Elizabeth.
- Peter, that was truly remarkable.
- Little going-away present.
Despite anything Romano may say, this place is really gonna miss you.
- I wish I could say the same.
- Wasn't all that bad.
We had our moments.
Your son lost a lot of blood.
However, we were able to repair the damage.
He's got a long road ahead of him, but he's gonna make it.
I don't know how to thank you.
Just get the gun out of your house.
I guess Santa didn't buy you that bike you asked for.
- Carter, what are you doing here?
- Cleo told me this was on your route.
- Come on. You want to join me?
- No.
If I wanna get my heart rate up, I'll have another cup of coffee.
Got your message.
Guess there's no way to talk you out of it, huh?
Done deal.
I got you something.
- Carter-
- Open it.
You're a tough guy to shop for.
An El token?
Second week of my surgical internship we got 11 traumas in one night.
5 a. m., we were still patching together... a girl that had been dragged under a car.
I was so tired I couldn't see straight.
I asked you if I could take a break and you kicked me out of the O.R.
I couldn't drive home, I was so exhausted.
I started crying in the hallway. You came out of surgery and you gave me that. You said I could use it to go home.
Or I could commit to what I was doing and... use it to come back the next day.
No Rolex, huh?
If you get tired of Schaumburg, you can use it to come back.
- Carter, they don't use tokens anymore.
- Then call.
And I'll come pick you up.
- Look, I want you to know-
- I know.
That I owe you.
Getting cold.
I better move on.
- Merry Christmas.
I'm a good doctor because of you.
No, you're not. But keep trying.
E. R. 8x07 "IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE"
- Sign in.
- Actually-
- Where are our T-sheets?
- I'm a new med student.
Congratulations. You said that yesterday.
- Check in with the docs.
- Okay, thanks. - Do you guys have a lost-and-found box?
- Somebody stole it.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you Dr. Carter?
Lewis.
I don't think he's in yet.
And I'm not old enough to be a ma'am.
- I'm supposed to meet him around 8.
- You're a tad early. Yeah, it's my first day.
I guess I was a little excited. You'll get over it.
So Mr. Hopper, what seems to be the problem?
I can't eat. I can't sleep. I just don't feel like myself.
- How long has this been going on?
- A few weeks. Any stress?
Family?
Work? All my problems started when I met this girl at an after-hours bar.
- She bit me.
- She bit you where?
In the alley outside the club-
- No, where on your body?
- My neck. I'm pretty sure she was a vampire.
That's a hickey.
- Is that a zygoma fracture?
- Maybe. - Are you Dr. Carter?
- Nope, Greene.
I'm Michael Gallant. I'm supposed to be meeting Dr. Carter.
You found the ER.
That's half the battle.
- You called for surgical consult!
- I changed my mind.
After I got down here. He has rectal pain.
Probably prostatitis.
That's why I need to examine him. If it is an appy, he's probably going to need surgery.
- Somebody need a second opinion?
- Nope. Yes! He has a 22-year-old male with right-sided tenderness.
Who also says it burns when he pees.
- What's his urine and white count?
- Still waiting. Usually you won't even come till labs are back.
Fine. When it bursts, you can operate.
- Hey, Dr. Carter?
- Kovac.
- Dr. Kovac. - Hold on.
Elizabeth!
What's going on?
- Isn't it obvious?
- No. He calls for a surgical consult, then changes his mind...
- ... the moment he sees it's me! - That's a bit egocentric, don't you think?
They're afraid to have me treat their patients.
You're being paranoid. Am I?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Do you know where Dr. Carter is?
- He should be here in a few minutes. - Listen, I know you're really busy.
- If you say where he is, I could find him.
- I don't know. Sorry.
- How come there aren't any doughnuts?
- No petty cash. There was 50 bucks in there yesterday.
I need a psych consult. My patient thinks he's a vampire.
Count Fred?
Where is he?
- Exam 2.
- Is there a nurse in with him? - No, why?
- He's a vampire.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, he drinks people's blood. You're kidding, right?
That's nasty.
But I volunteered to drive to the Royal Botanical Gardens fundraiser.
I'm sorry, but there's just not much I can do about it.
You can stop lying to me.
- Good morning.
- Dr. Carter.
- Did I miss something?
- Yes, breakfast.
Your grandmother's upset because the Jaguar's being serviced.
For a week!
- What's wrong with it?
- Yes, Alger.
What's wrong with it?
- They're waiting for a part.
- What part?
- The ignition coil.
- Liar.
He's holding me hostage.
- What's the matter with the Town Car?
- I don't drive the Town Car.
You shouldn't be driving anyway.
That's why we have Alger.
Having a driver was your grandfather's idea.
Now that he's gone, it seems an unnecessary expense.
He's just trying to look out for you.
I'm a big girl.
I don't need a chaperone.
Oh, John, are you still planning to come with me to-?
Gamma!
- Nurses do most of the triaging, right?
So maybe you could sneak me some minor cases.
Maybe you could sit down read your orientation kit, and wait for Dr. Carter.
- What's going on?
- Teaching Nicole to take blood pressure.
- Why?
- It's part of her training.
- What training?
- I'm learning to be a nurse's aide.
- Really?
- Abby?
No helmet. Alert at the scene. GCS-14.
- Any blood loss or seizure?
Okay, let's get him in Trauma 1.
Nicole, come on.
- Me? - Yeah, it'll be good for you to watch.
Must've taken a header off the skateboard.
Bad scalp lac, hematoma, right peritemporal.
Abby, show Nicole how to take a pulse ox.
Put some gloves on.
- Can I watch?
- Why don't we sell tickets?
- You a med student?
- Michael Gallant.
- Dr. Finch.
- Nice to meet you.
- Road rash all the way down the chest.
- Big abdominal bruise.
BP's 90 over 60. Pulse, 115.
Full trauma panel, lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Jeremy, do you remember what happened?
Right pupil is sluggish, slightly larger than the left.
18 gauge in the right AC.
- What's his pulse ox? - I can't get it.
Abby?
Make sure the fingernail has contact with that red light.
No CSF or blood from the ears.
100 of fentanyl and page Benton and Neurosurg.
Read the number off of this monitor.
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
-78.
- What?
Pulse ox is 78 on 15 liters.
Okay.
Good job.
- What do you think?
- Hyper-resonant on the right. Decreased breath sounds, low sats, hypotension.
Tension pneumothorax, right?
Yeah.
I had a fainting spell, John. It happens.
But it shouldn't happen.
In my day, it was quite acceptable for a lady to swoon.
- There's a med student looking for you.
- I'm a little busy.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Carter.
- Hello.
Hi, Evan. Your mother's on her way.
She found your inhaler in the laundry.
Gam, will you sit up for me, put your legs over the end of the bed?
Yes, John.
You're not gonna make me do pushups, are-?
Gam?
Gamma?
Gamma?
Susan. Gamma, can you hear me?
Okay.
You're okay.
I need to step out for a minute.
I'll be right back.
- Checking orthostatics?
- Yeah. - Is she anemic?
- I don't know.
I'm sending her up for a tilt test.
She might be dehydrated, it's probably nothing.
- Can I intubate?
- Maybe next time.
What am I looking at?
Teenage skateboarder, tension pneumo on the left, with a head injury.
Needs a central line.
He's anterior.
I can see the cords.
I'm in.
Okay, bag him, Nicole.
Come on.
One, two, three, squeeze.
He did all this on a skateboard?
- Trying a crazy stunt, no doubt.
- Good breath sounds.
Probably has a depressed skull fracture.
That's what they used to call a ping-pong fracture?
- Neurosurg is on the way.
- Pressure's dropping.
Okay, he's bleeding somewhere.
How much out in the chest tube?
Less than a liter.
First HemoCue is nine.
Let's hang the O-neg.
Get him to O.R. Has he had Dilantin?
Yeah. And 70 grams of mannitol.
What about his head?
- Who are you?
- Michael Gallant.
You a trauma surgeon?
- You a med student?
- Yes, sir. Why don't you find something to do, all right?
Let's get him ready to go.
I'm in. - I'll learn more here.
- You'll learn more with your eyes open...
- ... and your mouth shut, okay?
- He's got a point.
- Won't make a difference... if he bleeds out in his chest first.
Okay, let's move.
- You did good.
- Really? I was so scared.
- You get used to it.
- I don't know.
- You saved his life.
- Yeah, I hope so.
Me too.
I better go back to work.
I'll see you later.
What are you doing?
- What? - What?
This morning she was learning to take a BP, now she's in a trauma?
- Yeah, she's learning.
- To be an aide, not a nurse.
- I know you don't like her, but-
- That has nothing to do with this.
It's inappropriate that she be in trauma and you know it.
- I just asked you to help her.
- That's not my job, Luka.
Do you even realize what I do in there?
You're not the only one trying to save that kid's life.
- I'm gonna go ahead and scrub in.
- I'll page Neurosurg again.
- Dr. Benton?
- Yeah? - Yeah, are you Peter Benton?
- Yeah.
Consider yourself served.
What was that about?
Peter?
- I'm being subpoenaed.
- For what case?
Reece. Roger's suing for custody.
So how extensive do you think his brain injury is?
- It's too early to tell.
- How is he?
The skateboarder. Is he gonna be okay?
Are you his father?
No.
I'm David Hilliker. I called 911.
Did you see what happened?
Screwing around in the mall with buddies.
Looked like he hit his head.
- Yeah. He wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Wouldn't be cool. Don't need helmets to drive a motorcycle in this state. Why a skateboard?
- You got a little limp.
- Oh, yeah.
I twisted it chasing him and his buddy out of the mall.
- You should let us look at it.
Come on. - Ice pack and a couple beers, I'll be fine.
Sit down.
- We just need to change the dressing.
- But Dr. Carter usually does that.
I'm aware of that, but Dr. Carter's not here right now.
- We'll wait.
- I don't know when he'll be in.
- I'm very patient.
- Look, Sister. Helen.
- The sooner I change the bandage...
- I'm Monica. ...the sooner you guys can get out of here and get back to doing your stuff.
And, quite frankly, I need the bed.
Perhaps if you told Dr. Carter we were here?
- Your fans are getting restless.
- What is it with you and nuns, Carter?
It's almost kinky.
- Can you take care of them for me?
- They're looking for you.
My grandmother had a...
She passed out this morning.
Having Cardiology work her up.
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.
- Are you? - Me?
I'm fine. - Just wanna see she gets settled.
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.
- Come on, ladies. Tequila Willie is still in Exam 1, covered in puke and assorted body fluids.
- He's making this whole place reek.
- This place always reeks.
- Yeah. And it's Abby's turn.
- Oh, come on.
I did him last time.
You're up.
Fine.
- Nicole.
- You need something?
Yeah, grab some gloves. I'm gonna show you how to bathe a patient.
Robert!
I was scrubbing in when I discovered Dale's doing my Whipple.
Yeah, he's an arrogant ass, but he's becoming a decent surgeon.
- I thought I was back on service today.
- No, not yet.
Why not? I've complied with every insulting, demeaning request.
Even volunteered for a lie detector test.
But we have to wait for the CDC to finish with their bug hunt.
But the criminal investigation is essentially over.
- Couldn't find anything.
- What's that mean? "We think you're killing your patients, we just can't prove it?"
- This has nothing to do with you.
- Then why am I not in surgery?
I'm sorry.
I know this is frustrating. But what choice does either one of us have?
Take the opportunity to catch up with your dictation. Spend time with your baby. Enjoy the downtime.
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me? - That's my patient.
- Drawing blood.
No, you were injecting something into her central line.
I couldn't get a draw.
It's clogged. - What did you inject into my patient?
- I didn't.
- Don't lie to me!
I saw you! - Is there a problem here?
- No, I was-
- Yes. She was injecting my patient.
Urokinase to bust the clot in her line.
Let me see it.
Where's the vial?
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Twenty-six years with the Chicago P.D. Never fired my gun once.
That's good.
These are different times.
Try and stay off your ankle and keep it elevated.
- Dr. Kovac, Jeremy's mother's here.
- Okay.
I'll have one of the nurses give you a lesson on using the crutches.
Mrs. Norris? Hi.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
I was the first doctor to treat your son.
- How is he?
- He suffered a hemothorax.
That's when blood collects in the chest cavity and collapses a lung.
- But it's been repaired.
- Can I see him?
- He's been taken up to the O.R.
- But he's gonna be okay.
There was evidence of a head injury.
Is he in a coma?
I'm afraid we won't know until he's out of surgery and the anesthesia wears off.
There's the idiot who was chasing him, right there.
- Are you the boy's mother?
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
I'm sorry-
- He threw his stick at him. - What?
- You should get back in bed.
No, he's the one who made Jeremy wipe out.
Your boy was riding in the mall.
I asked him to leave.
- You knocked him off his skateboard!
- I didn't!
- You attacked my son? - No!
- You did!
- Can you put him in the room?
- What'd you do? - Nothing!
- I called the ambulance!
Last door on the right.
- He hurt my son? - I don't know, ma'am.
He's the reason Jeremy's here.
He should be arrested or something!
I just wanna see Jeremy. I just wanna be with my son.
I'll get an update and find out when you can go to see him, okay?
- I think he's having a heart attack!
- Good!
He started hyperventilating and complaining of chest pain.
- What's going on, Mr. Hilliker?
- I don't feel so good.
- Chest hurts?
- Yeah.
Head is spinning.
Okay, put him on oxygen, aspirin and let's get an EKG.
I didn't mean to upset the mother. I was just trying to offer my condolences.
Just relax.
He rode by me. He stole my hat.
He was tossing it back and forth, threatening to throw it in the fountain.
- They were terrorizing the mall.
- Did you throw your nightstick at him?
Okay. Okay. Just relax.
- Dr. Zogoiby.
- Dr. Corday.
I've been reviewing charts and I have a question about a patient you worked on with me. - Yes?
- It was a few weeks ago.
I'm having a little difficulty reading your notes.
- You put in a central line.
- No, I was called away. That was the day my son fell off the monkey bars at school.
The on-call anesthesiologist stepped in for me.
- And who was that?
- Babcock.
- Hope this wasn't a waste of time.
- Think this kid'll ever wake up?
- I don't know.
You're scaring me. You're not your usual jolly self today. Haven't developed a drug addiction or drinking problem like your buddies...
Give it time.
- Jeremy's mother is in the waiting room. - Great.
Jacy, have you tracked down my sister yet?
- I left another message. - All right. Thanks.
- You want me to talk to her?
- No.
Good.
Mrs. Norris. Hi.
I'm Dr. Benton.
I'm one of the surgeons that was with Jeremy.
- How is he?
- We tied off the bleeding vessels in the chest, but there's swelling in the brain.
He's with a neuro team now.
With an injury like this, it becomes a...
- A waiting game.
- Waiting?
To see if he wakes up?
Waiting to see if he's a vegetable?
What?
All of that.
They've got to be able to do something.
He's all I've got.
Yeah.
- Ever gotten an erythropoietic porphyria?
- No. - What about porphyria cutanea tarda?
- No.
The most unusual medical case you've ever seen?
I had a guy with a live bullfrog in his ass once.
Ever seen a patient scratch through the skin into the bone?
- Are you serious?
- Figure he'll hit gray matter by spring.
Mr. Eldon, could you show a young med student your itch?
- Save me. - What?
I have a med student who is in need of a home.
- No, thanks. But he seems nice.
- Oh, yeah.
Of course he does.
That's how they all start, till they grow up to become Residents like Carter.
I wish.
- What?
- "I wish"?
He turned into a good doctor.
- He is.
- You and Carter...?
Dr. Greene, can I ask you something?
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
Not at all.
You don't mind me asking all these questions, do you?
Of course not.
This is a teaching hospital.
This is how you learn. Bye.
Oh, hi.
I was just talking about you.
How's your grandmother? What is it?
- Looks like Shy-Drager.
- I'm sorry.
They've been having a lot of success with fludrocortisone and desmopressin.
- How'd she take it?
- I haven't told her yet. They're still running some tests.
- Anything I can do? - I don't think so.
- Let me know. - I will.
Carter!
Dr. John Carter, this is your new med student, Michael...
- Gallant.
- Hi.
Go get the orientation package, when you're finished just come find me.
I did that while I was waiting. I try to keep busy.
- Yeah. I had a family emergency.
- Nothing serious, I hope.
You wanna talk about it?
Okay.
Well, I watched a trauma already and helped Dr. Kovac with a possible Ml.
Both of which were very interesting. But I was hoping that once you got here I could start working up some of my own cases.
He stepped into the men's room.
His grandmother's sick.
Do you want to see if we can go find you a case to work up?
Yeah.
Kit. I want to apologize for my behavior earlier. It was completely unprofessional.
I know it's not an excuse, but I have been under a lot of stress lately.
I understand.
That said, I also have a couple of questions about some recent cases.
- Do you remember a Mr. Durning?
- Diverticulitis?
No, he was an elderly gentleman, came in for a hemicolectomy for colon cancer.
- With all the faded Navy tattoos. - Yes, yes.
You took out his central line on October the 16th.
Yes.
Well, no.
It came out on the 16th. But we didn't do it.
Babcock did.
Babcock?
- Why Babcock?
- I don't know. He just did.
Sometimes he likes to pull his own lines.
In fact, occasionally he insists on it.
So Mrs. Reynolds, how long have you had the spots?
- About a week.
- I gave her some penicillin.
- Oh, for what?
- I got a cold.
Cough, sore throat, headaches.
Antibiotics won't help.
- I told you.
- Where'd you get the penicillin?
The medicine cabinet.
Left over from an ear infection.
Oh, yeah, you should never share prescriptions.
- If you're given one, try to use all of it.
- What's wrong?
She's experiencing hypersensitivity vasculitis.
It's from the antibiotics.
Thank you, Dr. Kevorkian.
- Is it treatable?
- Absolutely.
We'll get some medicine for you and have you feeling as good as new.
- You might wanna get a CBC.
- I beg your pardon?
Her history. It could be indicative of undiagnosed thrombocytopenia.
- You know, low platelets.
- And you are...?
Grace.
I'm a second-year med student.
Ask if she has any unusual bleeding when she brushes her teeth.
- Are you a med student at this hospital?
- No.
I'd appreciate it if you kept your comments to yourself.
Hello.
- Is he your student?
- Excuse me?
She's a second-year med student who thinks she can diagnose my patients.
He takes a lousy history.
I will bet your lunch money she's got thrombocytopenia.
She's right.
Low platelets.
Needs additional labs, head CT and admission.
I'll take care of it.
You're welcome.
So do you do self-diagnosis too?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I've let myself get a little rundown and I can feel the flu coming on.
I can't afford to be sick now.
I was hoping you'd get me a little Relenza or Tamiflu.
We can manage that.
What school are you in?
Western and Binville.
I'm getting my law degree simultaneously.
Really?
My parents didn't want me to go to med school.
I know that feeling.
Excuse me. Can you get a head CT for Mrs. Reynolds in Curtain 2?
I'm not a nurse.
I'm just training.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I'm sort of in training myself.
- I'm a new med student, Michael.
- Nicole.
- How are you doing? - Oh, okay.
- Everybody helping you?
- Abby showed me how to bathe...
- ... a homeless man. It was a little-
Abby is pretty busy.
Stick with Malik and Haleh.
- Is this Mr. Hilliker's 12-lead? - Yeah.
Did he have an MI? No.
Probably just an anxiety attack.
- Want to give him the good news?
- Can I?
Yeah. I've got a trauma coming in.
We're gonna need some IV saline. It's in the suture room. Okay.
- It can get a little crazy here.
- Yeah, I know. It's only my first day.
- Are you liking it?
- So far, so good.
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Go and get somebody!
Take a breath, Mr. Hilliker.
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Hang on.
Hang on.
Sorry this is taking so long.
- Did you get some lunch? - No.
I didn't get anything.
That cardiologist has never been back to see me. Yeah.
It's because I asked to speak to you first. Why?
It's the least I can do, since you've been stuck here all day.
John, don't beat around the bush.
You have what's called Shy-Drager Syndrome.
It's a progressive disease that affects your blood pressure and could put you at a greater risk for a heart attack or stroke.
Is it gonna kill me?
Most people die within 10 years.
I'm not even sure I want to be around 10 more years.
Ten days, now, that might have put a kink in my plans. - Gam-
- Can I go home?
- I think they want you to stay overnight.
- John, I want to go home.
- You on a break? - No.
- Can I get you a coffee? - No, thanks.
Do you want to talk?
Is he going to die?
The guy that hung himself? No.
Well, not today.
He's lucky you and that med student walked in.
Try not to let it upset you too much.
Once in a while some freak tries to off himself in the hospital.
I wish they would just do it at home.
My father hung himself.
I was only 8.
He'd lost another job. I found him in the kitchen.
I was too little to do anything.
- Oh, God. I'm sorry. - It's okay.
- Does Luka know this? - No.
I never told him.
I never told anyone.
I don't think I can do this.
- Well, it's not always this bad. - Look at me.
I'm crying like a baby.
We've all cried.
Sometimes it's the only thing you can do.
I went through my charts.
I found another commonality to all my post-op infection mortalities. What am I looking for?
- I highlighted his name.
Yeah.
He was in every case.
I only missed it before because he stepped in for Dr. Zogoiby, whose handwriting is illegible.
Dr. Babcock is gonna have a date with your friend from the health department.
- Phone call, Dr. Greene. - Take a message.
He knew I was being investigated.
Why didn't he step forward, say something?
Maybe he didn't want to be probed or forced to give stool samples. I'm being serious.
Who knows what he's working with in his lab. I'm sorry.
That's Rachel's school. They need you to pick her up. - Is she all right?
- She got suspended.
- For what?
- I don't know.
That's not my business. - Suspended?
- It must be some kind of mistake.
- Probably drug-related.
- You better go. I'll deal with this.
- How's he doing?
- Pulse ox is 98 on 50%. Good.
Mr. Hilliker, we had to put a tube down your throat to help you breathe.
I'm gonna take it out now, okay?
I want you to take some deep breaths.
When I say blow, I want you to blow as hard as you can. Ready?
Okay, blow.
I'm sorry.
Try not to speak, Mr. Hilliker. Take some deep breaths.
- Tell him.
He doesn't want us to tell the police.
He's still got buddies on the force.
I'm afraid we have to.
It's gonna be okay, Mr. Hilliker. It's gonna be okay.
- His wife died last year. - What?
Breast cancer.
He was a respected and decorated police officer.
Only reason he took the job at the mall was so that he could still help people.
- Why are you telling me this?
- I just thought you should know.
Keep an eye on his vitals and call for a psych consult.
-100.8.
- Feels like 108. BP is 140 over 80.
And your white count is 14,000. You're a little anemic.
40% of menstruating women are anemic.
My diagnosis is you're a little rundown.
Maybe it's time to pick a career.
Medicine beats law any day.
My parents will only pay for med school if I graduate law school.
If your parents are both attorneys, why don't you have any health insurance?
I have a sad and complicated relationship with them that you couldn't understand. I might surprise you.
You need to take better care of yourself, Grace.
You need to eat right, get plenty of sleep and lay off the caffeine- I would if I could.
I haven't had eight hours' sleep in months.
Do you think you could get me some Halcion?
- I don't think so.
- Just one dose. I mean...
Today is shot for me. If I could just go home and crash. Please?
I diagnosed your student's patient.
This is a one-time special treatment and only if you promise to do the other things we talked about.
Cross my heart.
What are the EKG findings for hyperkalemia?
Peaked T waves, prolonged PR and short QT intervals.
You're good.
Your day getting any better? - Not yet.
Did you talk to your grandmother?
How did she take it?
It didn't bother her. She went home. - You let her drive?
- No. Her driver picked her up.
- You have to notify the DMV.
- I didn't tell her that. Dying's one thing.
Not driving is another story.
- You have to mail in the notice.
- I didn't see her as an ER patient. - I brought her in.
- It's the law.
- I can't rat out my own grandmother.
She doesn't like me. Carter!
Your patient went down.
- What happened?
- She must have vagalled. All right.
Let's get the gurney.
All right, come on. - I need to talk.
- Somebody took target practice on a crossing guard.
I gotta plug her up.
- It's rather important. - Well, give me the Cliff Notes.
I'm listening.
- I'd prefer to have your full attention. - Suit yourself.
Are you joining us, Elizabeth?
I'm afraid not.
If you could have your assistant page me when you're done, please?
Thanks for coming.
- Want something to eat?
No, no. So, what did he say?
I talked to Mitch and Sophie, my friend that works in the courthouse.
They said the worst thing to do is fight.
- I can fight it if I want to?
- It looks like you got something to hide.
What if I'm just offended by the whole principle?
Peter, you go in.
You get swabbed. They run the DNA. And you can prove once and for all that Reece is your son.
- What if he's not, Jackie?
- Is that really a possibility?
- What are you doing?
- You're out of surgery.
The patient coded before we even got started.
What are you doing down here?
I wanted to ask you about a couple of cases.
You know, it doesn't matter anyway. It'll have to wait. I've just been paged.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I believe those are mine.
Thank you.
I must be dehydrated.
All I've had is coffee and a muffin since last night.
You want to tell us about the scars?
I used to be a cutter.
My parents fought a lot when I was a kid, and I was a geek in school.
I developed an eating disorder.
It was my way of dealing with stress.
Did you ever see anybody about it?
The only people who seemed to care were the doctors and nurses.
- Probably why I'm in med school. - What about now?
Are you still cutting?
No.
- Show me your arm.
- You don't believe me?
You have a fever and a borderline white count.
Maybe from an infection, or using a dirty blade.
- I told you I haven't eaten.
- So the eating disorder continues? - No.
I've just been cramming.
- Pull up your skirt.
- Pardon me? I don't think so.
- Let me see your thigh.
- You ass!
- You're still cutting.
- We just want to help you. - Okay, hold on. Grace.
- I have a pathology final.
- If you don't stay I'll put you on psych hold.
- On what grounds?
- Danger to self. - That's not true.
- Grace, Grace, wait.
Stop!
You're blowing this way out of proportion!
- Why are you doing this?
- I know what it's like to need help when you least want it.
- Please just leave me alone. - I can't.
What are you staring at? You couldn't even diagnose thrombocytopenia.
- Get five of droperidol. - No! No, stop!
I don't need that!
Get back into bed now. - Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
Please. Please.
Please.
- Take it easy. It's okay.
- You'll ruin everything.
Please, you'll ruin everything.
No, please, stop. Don't. No, don't
- Don't, please.
Can't you just...?
- I had to get a doctor to cover for me. - I'm sorry.
- Scissors, Rachel?
- It's not like they said.
Did you threaten this girl?
It was Natalie.
I threatened to cut her dreadlocks, not stab her. Why?
She tried to steal Andrew away from me.
She keeps on sending notes in class...
- ... and asking him over to study. - This is over a boy.
- It's no big deal, Dad.
- Then why aren't you in gym class now?
Maybe because they stopped teaching gym in the '70s.
This is serious. You've been suspended.
Next time you will be expelled permanently.
There won't be a next time. Right. Because now we have a new set of rules.
- Like what?
- No more rides to school unless it's with Elizabeth or me.
No more going out on weeknights or weekends for that matter, for at least a month.
- Why don't you send me to a convent? - I would.
But I need you around the house to do all your chores. I have chores now?
Yep. Think of yourself as Cinderella...
- ... and I'm your evil stepmother.
- I've already got one of those.
Keep it up.
You'll find yourself back in St. Louis.
- Why are you doing this to me?
Maybe because I love you? - Oh, really?
- Yes, really.
Do you know how many messed-up teenagers I see?
Drug addicts, suicides, 10-year-old homeless girls who've been raped because nobody gave a damn about them? Well, I give a damn about you. You may not like it now.
Hell, you may never like it. This is how it's gonna be.
Get in.
- Need any help? - Hey. Did you page me?
No, but I figured I might find you in here.
How are you?
Good.
Did you talk to Jackie? Yeah.
She thinks I should take the test.
So, what happens if you're not a genetic match?
Well, I guess it makes it easier for Roger to fight me for custody.
Nothing's changed, Peter.
You're still his father.
So what are you two doing for dinner? Why don't you come to my place?
I have those fish sticks in the freezer Reece likes.
Take it easy.
- Someone's getting a little frustrated.
- He's tired. He wants to go home.
Daddy can't take you home.
I have to work.
What's he saying?
He wants his other daddy to come take him home.
Gamma, because you cannot drive. Because you could black out.
No, I'm
- Hey, I'm sorry.
No, I'm not.
No, I am not.
- She won't stop driving? - She's calling from the car.
She's been driving around for two hours just to prove me wrong.
She could hurt herself or somebody else.
- What are you gonna do? - What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Call the cops on my grandmother?
- You already made me call the DMV. - Me?
Don't make me the bad guy.
- I should go home, wait for her.
- I can wait with you.
- Yeah?
- I mean, yeah, if you want.
Enter!
I was just about to page you. Have a seat.
So, Elizabeth.
Dr. Babcock says that you were trespassing in his office and his research area.
Care to elaborate?
- I wanted to talk to him.
- You knew I was in surgery.
He's worked on every one of my cases that died from a post-operative infection.
- Is this true? - Yes.
It's true.
- And I have evidence to prove it. - So what?
You have made it clear on more than one occasion you are not opposed to euthanasia.
I can't imagine a humane doctor who is.
- I have four bodies in the morgue! - That's not my fault.
You need to take responsibility for your gross misjudgment!
- This is a load of crap.
You allow her to operate on elderly lost souls who should never be in surgery.
And then when they die, which they inevitably will she comes looking for someone to blame! They didn't die from surgery.
They died from post-op infection. - The key word there being "post-op. "
- Okay.
If you hadn't operated, they'd be alive.
This whole thing has gotten out of hand.
The health department has yet to conclude its investigation.
Until they do, neither one of you is in the O.R. Happy? - No.
- That's not a solution.
It works for me.
- I'm not doing another case with her. - You certainly aren't.
Get out, both of you.
You're giving me a headache.
Go.
God is love.
You can go home, Gallant. Carter signed out.
Oh, yeah, I know.
I think I'm gonna stay and study. Here?
Maybe I'll pick up stuff by osmosis.
You'll pick up something.
Feeling better?
What do you want?
I heard you talking about your pathology exam.
I thought you might like to take a look at Robbins.
Thanks.
I'm sorry about some of the crap I said to you.
- I think I was just a little stressed. - I know what that's like.
So you obviously know your vasculitidies.
How are you with your glycogen-storage diseases?
- Not so good. - Yeah.
Me neither.
Mr. Benton? I am Asha.
You're here for a DNA test? Yeah.
Don't worry, it's painless.
I'm just gonna use this swab to wipe the inside of your cheek. Okay? - Yeah.
- Say "ah. "
Okay, all done.
That wasn't so bad, now, was it?
- I can't believe it. - I didn't believe it either.
Fentanyl.
If you're gonna abuse drugs, abuse a good one. - Wow.
- I've been clean and sober for a year.
You got it out of your system.
I wouldn't say that.
What?
Nothing.
- Disappointed in me? - No! No.
I'm just...
You were stabbed. Twice.
I don't recommend it.
- Can I see your scar? - What?
- Show me your scar.
- No.
- Why not?
Don't be bashful.
- Why?
Get your own.
Why do I feel like a school kid sitting out here?
Must be the adolescent sexual tension.
That's it.
You know, I used to have a crush on you.
- Used to?
- It's all coming back to me now.
- I used to have a crush on you too. - Liar.
I did!
You were cute.
- Real cute. But- - But?
Well, you were a med student, I was a Resident...
I'm a Resident now.
- Chief Resident. - That's right.
Glad you came back.
Me too.
Gamma's home.

- Change, lady?
- Sorry. Look out!
Sorry.
- His buddies said he just passed out.
- There's rigor mortis and lividity.
It was a crowded scene.
It was easier to grab him. - It's gonna be harder to dump him.
- Come on, doc.
No. Look, I'm not tying up a room with a dead body. Take him to the morgue.
- You've got a morgue.
Load him up. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
This is a county hospital.
Let me know when you start paying taxes and wearing clothes.
This should be enough Elimite for everyone. Wash your bedding in hot water.
- And the dog too?
Why not? Make a follow-up with your regular health care provider.
- This is our regular health care provider.
- Right. - Hi.
I'm looking for Mark Greene.
- Talk to the clerk.
Dude, it only takes, like, two minutes to freeze a wart off.
Actually, less. But you still have to wait like everybody else.
- Hi, I'm looking for Dr. Greene.
- Fill this out and take a seat over there.
- I'm not a patient.
We're having lunch.
- Chairs are that way. - Okay. You'll tell him I'm here?
- I'll tell him.
- You might wanna know my name.
- County General.
- Excuse me.
- My fault. Can you help me? I'm looking for Mark Greene.
Yosh, labs back on the gallbladder on Exam 1?
- Check the computer.
- He's a friend.
- Hang on. - Have you still not forgiven me?
- My angelfish died.
- I'll buy you another one.
- There were two.
- I'll buy three. - Can you help?
I'm looking for Dr. Greene.
- Check with the clerk.
Go ahead and call the mayor! Shut us down, for all I care!
Dr. Lewis!
- Dr. Lewis.
- Ralph?
Ralph Binks. Six years ago, I was tapping the electrical main downstairs took 20 amps in the ass. You treated me, said I was gonna be just fine.
- Right.
Right. - Well, I wasn't.
My life has been a living hell of static cling since then!
So thanks, doc. Thanks for nothing.
Bet I know what you came here for.
Is that it?
So she just got on a plane?
Sent for the twins the next day, haven't seen her since.
Dr. Kovac doesn't know what happened.
- Dr. Kovac?
- A tall, hunky guy, dark hair.
- You can't miss him.
- And you don't want to.
Can someone move Mr. Schnack before we have to hold the wake ourselves?
- She's still here?
- Worse.
She's in charge.
Excuse me. Ladies, we have patients breaking the eight-hour mark.
- Yeah.
- Don't be a stranger.
I won't.
What a surprise.
Are you here for the ACEP assembly?
No, I'm here on some interviews.
- In Chicago?
- I'm meeting Mark for lunch.
He's in with a bad GSW.
Yeah, I finally got someone to talk to me.
- Where have you gone to?
- What?
Hospitals.
Rush, Northwestern, a couple of privates.
Looking for a staff position?
- Well, good luck with that.
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.
- Welcome back.
- Sort of.
You mind?
I work here.
- Chest cavity's filled with clot.
- Sats are down to 60.
Lap pad.
Who's that?
It's Susan Lewis.
- Your friend from Scottsdale?
- Phoenix.
Says Scottsdale on the phone bill. Metzenbaum scissors.
She looks great, doesn't she?
Pericardium's tense with blood.
- What's she doing here?
- We're supposed to have lunch.
There's a big bleeder underneath.
- You didn't say anything about lunch.
- I didn't?
Can you feel the defect?
I can't put my finger on it.
You're here for a reason, Mrs. McDuffy.
- It's Miss.
- Miss McDuffy.
Let's start with I'm tired, I'm depressed, I can't concentrate. I've got headaches and hives. And I'm bloated and constipated.
- And it hurts here too.
- Any chest pain?
- Oh, that's the worst of all.
- I see. That just about covers everything.
Can we get CBC, Chem-20, TSH, Free T4 troponin, CK with MB, lipase, EKG, chest x-ray, urine and a culture?
- That it?
- I've got a yeast infection too.
- Wonderful. - Wanna see it?
Maybe later.
- Be a sport. Do the pelvic.
- That might just put me over the edge.
- Into what?
Celibacy?
- Into taking it.
- You're not taking it.
- You like it here.
- I don't have a job here.
Weaver offered you shifts.
I can do shift work anywhere.
Northwestern. There's a tenured track, clinical faculty position.
You wanna be a professor now?
It's better job security.
Like you're in it for the money?
And my money says they have yeast infections at Northwestern.
- I'll let you know.
- If you really wanted it you would've taken it.
I have to tell them. They clocked it.
- Clocked what?
- I have to let them know by Friday.
- Tomorrow's Friday.
- I know.
John, can you take the hypochondriac with a spider bite-?
- Asking me or are you telling me?
- Whatever gets you to do it.
I told the creep all we had was traveler's checks. Wouldn't do him any good.
Pretty brazen for a mugger to hit you in broad daylight.
He didn't hit us.
Stan tripped over a curb trying to get away.
- Dr. Weaver? - I'll have the nurse get you an ice pack.
- He doesn't need an mri?
- Not this time.
Yesterday's positive list.
Make sure Frank routes them correctly this time.
- Last week, the cafeteria ended up with our UTI sensitivities.
Anything I should know about this meeting?
- What meeting?
- With Romano. Risk Management called me, so I'm assuming it's about the Marfan's death.
Has there been a wrongful-death suit filed?
In-house review is standard procedure in this kind of circumstance.
It's not an MM. These are lawyers, right?
Their job is to protect you...
- ... and the hospital. - And assess exposure.
- It's normal.
- Dave was fired. I just thought maybe-
Dr. Malucci's termination isn't reflective of anything. There were other concerns.
Other issues involved.
Am I in trouble here, Kerry?
I found it in my slipper. I figured you'd need its antivenom.
Actually, Chicago doesn't have any dangerous spiders.
- It doesn't?
- Not native anyway.
So this one hopped on a bus across the border. That bastard took a chunk out of my foot.
- It looks like a flea bite.
- A flea bite? I can feel the toxin...
- ... making its way to my heart.
-1 % hydrocortisone cream Benadryl for the itching, and get yourself a flea bomb.
- That's it?
- That's it.
You've got this down. Why would you want to leave it?
- Yeah, right.
- Pardon, miss?
What's your name again?
- Abby.
- I'm Nicole. We met at the bar with Luka.
- I was your waitress.
- Right.
What happened to your hand?
I cut myself. Not bad, but I think it needs to be... How do you say?
- Sutured?
- Yeah, sutured.
That man over there, he won't tell Luka I'm here. He's so rude.
You want me to take a look at it?
I was hoping Luka could look.
Well, Dr. Carter's very good at suturing.
- Luka is not working today?
- No, I think that he is. Isn't he, Abby?
- Sure. Come on. I'll get you a room.
- Thank you.
- Hey, don't hurt him!
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting him go.
- Why? You said he was innocent.
Frank, I think I need Housekeeping in here.
Funny, that's not how I remember you.
Son of a bitch!
That is.
- Dr. Lewis!
What are you doing here?
- Susan, Carter.
- Right.
Susan, hey!
- Would you believe I'm looking for work?
- In Chicago? - Yeah. Never say never.
- Well, that's great.
- ... different.
- Yeah? You look the same.
- Are you interviewing? - Yeah.
- I have a meeting at Northwestern.
- Northwestern?
- Yeah. - Clinical faculty position?
- Yeah, why?
- I was just offered that job.
- Oh, no. It's in the ER.
- I switched back to emergency medicine.
- Oh, when?
- Forever ago.
So you must be Chief Resident.
No. That would be Dr. Chen.
- Deb Chen?
- It's Jing-Mei now. Jing-Mai now.
Jing... - Frank, what is it?
- I don't know what she calls herself.
- Robert. - Hey, lurking around the men's room now? Changing teams again?
You scheduled meetings with my Residents without telling me?
- Did you not get the memo?
- What memo? - The one saying I run the place.
- Dr. Chen's my responsibility. I expect to be notified if she's to be questioned.
- Fair. Consider yourself notified.
- Good. I wanna be there.
No. I don't even wanna be there.
As chief of the department, I think it's appropriate.
Don't interfere with Risk Management investigations.
- An investigation?
- Information gathering, whatever.
- They have a few questions.
- Dr. Chen approached me.
She was scared. She wants me to come with her.
She's a big girl.
She talked about lawyers. Do you want it to escalate to that or you want me to come?
Does she have something to hide?
No. The truth is bad enough. We should be trying to protect her.
- You sure you don't have a thing for her?
- Robert. Okay, fine, 3:00, seventh floor conference room.
- Good femoral with compressions.
- Stop CPR. - No pulse, no pressure.
- Your friend's back.
- What do you feel?
- Probable entry wound, left ventricle. - Feels ragged through the mitral valve.
- How big?
- Too big.
- Nothing's organized on the monitor.
- He's gone.
You wanna call it? - See if we can piece anything together.
- Okay, I'll be right back.
-0 silk on a needle driver.
- Hey. Give me 10 minutes?
- If there's still an express to Oak Park.
- Yeah. You look great.
- You look great too.
Dr. Greene, we got a 6-year-old boy with vomiting and severe dehydration.
- Get Cleo. - He's got a genetic disorder.
- Tachy at 120. BP's 90/60. - You know what?
I don't wanna be late. - I'll just come back after my interview.
- Okay.
That's great. Elizabeth, how are you doing?
- Forget it. Go. - Good to see things never change.
- Knock them dead.
- How long's he been vomiting?
- Three days. - He's dry as a bone.
- And you waited till now to bring him in?
His geneticist's at Mercy. Our insurance got messed up. They couldn't see us.
- Is he Down's?
- No. Trisomy 18.
- I thought they didn't survive past age 1.
- They don't.
Yeah. Belly's hard as a rock. Elizabeth, you better get in here!
- Let's do a rectal temp.
- I can do that if you want.
No, no. We'll let the nurse do it.
She does it for him all the time.
- What is it?
- Possible bowel obstruction.
Six-year-old boy with Edwards syndrome.
Six? I thought that was impossible.
- Apparently not.
- No luck with the IV.
- Prep a subclavian.
- It feels like a loop of bowel. I'll try to reduce.
Okay. It's probably perfed.
- Surprised he doesn't have a fever.
- He will. Probably dead bowel in addition to the obstruction. Let's take him to O.R.
- He's vomiting.
Let's roll him. - Please.
This has to stop. Once the line's in, we'll give Compazine.
That's not what she's asking.
Give him something for the pain.
- Titrate 6 of morphine.
- No, to end it. What?
Please, just end it for him.
I'll be upstairs. Have each Resident pick up at least two of the fast tracks when their sicker patients are tucked in.
- They don't listen to me.
- Make sure Mrs. Hertel...
- ... gets her gentamicin. - Two per kilo?
- Yeah.
- Are you ready?
- What?
- I'm going with you. - Why?
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Dr. Romano assures me it's routine.
- Then why are you going?
To represent the department, apparently. Haleh?
- Jing-Mei, no one is out to get anyone. You do this long enough, you make a serious mistake. - It's true for everyone.
- That's encouraging.
Mr. and Mrs. Schudy?
- He stopped vomiting? - Yes.
We've given him morphine for the pain and antibiotics and fluids.
You must think we're awful people.
No. No, I think that when a child is this ill, emotions can escalate. And I don't think you really want what you asked for.
No. No, of course we don't.
I don't know. Maybe we're both just too tired.
- Kenny needs round-the-clock care.
- I imagine he would.
Just tell us what you need to do.
Well, your son has an incarcerated inguinal hernia which we can repair. It's a simple procedure. But we will have to evaluate his internal organs.
- How many has he had so far?
- Four.
Three laparotomies and a VSD repair.
He's had more surgeries than birthdays.
I was opening for lunch. The back gate gets stuck sometimes.
It doesn't look deep enough to suture.
Let's irrigate and give her some Keflex.
My boss wanted me to finish my shift. He's such
- What do they say here?
A capitalist?
What did he want me to do, bleed on everybody's food?
Good thing he let you off. You don't want it to get infected.
He didn't let me. He fired me. After a year of working there seven nights a week.
Abby, where's that irrigation kit?
It's coming, Dr. Kovac.
What?
I'll be right there.
There might be a little scarring.
Will you be able to find another job?
I don't know.
He kept saying he'd make problems with my visa.
I think he can too.
- Is everything okay back there?
- Yeah.
Had you looked at the x-ray would you have recognized the widened mediastinum?
Yes, I think so.
- Well, how confident of that are you?
- I don't know. Confident.
Standard of care is to take a chest x-ray to rule out aortic dissection before ordering thrombolytics...
- ... correct? - That's right.
So why take one if you're not gonna look at it?
Dr. Chen has already admitted to a critical error. No need to belabor the point.
We're trying to understand what happened.
The treating Resident told me the x-ray was clear. He thought I meant hemothorax, I thought he meant signs of dissection.
- Dr. Malucci.
- He's been terminated since the incident.
That helps, I suppose.
In essence, the mistake was the result of a miscommunication during a time-sensitive critical care situation.
Except for the chain-of-command issue.
What issue?
How did you get involved in this case?
Chief Residents or Attendings are called on to sign off on any use of thrombolytics.
- Chief Residents who are Attendings.
- I am an Attending.
You are now, but at the time, you were five days from officially completing your Residency.
My appointment started July 1. I was making up days from my maternity leave.
Dr. Chen was given the authority of an Attending while a Chief Resident.
Prematurely. If she wasn't board-eligible, she wasn't officially authorized... - ... to make this decision.
- I thought I was.
- Who was your Attending?
- What?
Who was your Attending that night?
- Dr. Weaver.
- We're talking five days.
And where was Dr. Weaver?
Excuse me. I'm sitting right here. You can ask me.
You're here as a representative of the department. I'm interviewing Dr. Chen.
- She was out of the hospital.
- I was right across the street.
I was getting a meal with the understanding that Dr. Chen would page me for critical cases.
- And did you page her?
- Yes.
Before or after you authorized thrombolytics?
- Before and after.
- I never received a page.
- Three times total.
- You could have come to get me.
- I didn't know where you were.
- Carter knew.
He found me in time to stop you from cracking his chest.
Dr. Romano, this is why I interview participants separately.
The fact is, this is a systems error.
The cafeteria isn't open at 2 a. m., so you need to leave the building to get a meal.
You might consider brown-bagging it next time.
I'm done.
All right. Well, this has been very enlightening. Thank you, Dr. Chen.
- I'm sorry?
- You're excused.
Kerry, you stay.
That's gotta be a record, 35 minutes for a finger cut.
Do you need something?
9-year-old, scalp lac. He's a handful.
They didn't pull you out of court, did they?
Good.
- I thought you were taking a stool sample.
- I will, Miss McDuffy.
- But you have to go back and lie down.
- Because I have to go.
I have a friend who's having trouble with her visa. I thought you could help her.
- Do you know anything?
- What?
- About my condition?
- Yeah.
Not until your labs come back.
Work visa, French.
Does my having bad B.O. mean anything?
- That is possible. - Great.
I'll send her over.
- You have to lie down.
- Nicole. Thanks. I owe you.
What?
Nothing.
I thought she was going to protect me.
She went to protect herself.
- What did you expect?
- I don't know. It never occurred to me that she had to protect her own ass.
Maybe your asses aren't mutually exclusive.
Yeah. That's why she's still up there and I'm down here.
Weaver's political, true. But she's smart enough to protect her own.
- I don't see it. What's it look like?
- What?
- The spider.
- Nat, it's a big insect. Big, hairy.
You're a reflection on her. You're her choice for Chief Resident. She'll defend you.
- If only to defend herself.
- How's your back?
- Hurts like hell.
-35-year-old male, impaled...
- ... after a fall off a roof.
- How much blood loss?
Not a lot. We packed around the wound and stabilized it. No KO.
BP, 100/70. - Don't touch me!
- Hey.
What was he doing?
Wife said he was trying to get free cable.
Where's my wife?
Hi, baby.
I can't believe you have to open him again.
- Want me to go over the procedure? - No.
We know it by heart.
Right. Then I just need you to sign the consent, then.
It shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
There's a waiting area just down the hall.
Do you have a cafeteria?
Yeah. Third floor.
It's the only time my husband and I get to share a meal together when Kenny's in the hospital.
- I understand.
- Thank you.
Any messages?
Elsa Alcoran called, said she doesn't want the job.
- Did she say why?
- No. - No new nanny yet?
- No. Not one that signs.
Oh, yeah, right.
That must be hard to find.
- You look tired.
- So do you.
Parenting will do that to you.
Hi. This is Peter Benton. I got your message.
I was hoping you would reconsider.
If you could at least call me back, I would really appreciate it.
Okay? Thank you very much.
- What do we got?
- Fragments in the peritoneum.
- That's a hell of a fragment.
- BP's down to 70.
Bolus 2 liters wide open. Central line kit.
- Take it out, it's killing him. - We have to do it in O.R.
He could bleed uncontrollably here.
- HemoCue is 10.
- You should take her outside.
Two units O-neg standing by.
- Can't you give him something?
- We did.
- Melanie? - Full diaphragmatic rupture.
- Okay, let's red-line him.
- Melanie! - What?
- I love you!
No. No, shut up. You're not saying that.
- I do.
- Stop it.
- You'll be okay.
- Where's the O-neg?
- Waiting on Dr. Chen.
- Let's go!
Let's move! - You need some help?
- No, no. I almost got it.
Didn't she leave a guide wire in some poor schlub's chest?
That was over six years ago. She was a medical student.
But now there's a pattern.
If we don't show we took corrective measures we could have real exposure if she kills anyone else.
- That's a little dramatic.
- He's dead. Can't get much more dramatic.
There's no reason to think she'll kill anyone else.
- Can you guarantee that?
