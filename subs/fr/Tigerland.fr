My father said the Army makes all men one.
But you never know which one.
He didn't know Roland Bozz.
Get up!
Get the fuck up!
Come on.
Get your fucking low-life asses out of bed!
You got 15 minutes or you're gonna do pushups until I pass out.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get up!
Let's go!
Get your socks on and get outside, you fucking pussies!
-Hurry up!
-Move!
-Ain't got all day.
-Move your ass, soldier.
Richard Nixon, drop the bomb
I don't wanna go to Nam
Next time won't be no weekend in the stockade.
It'll be a full-scale motherfucking court-martial.
Maybe a few years hard time in Leavenworth.
How's that fly, dipshit?
Discounting reception, basic training corrective custody been in the Army more than three months.
Most of it in the stockade.
Get on that fucking deuce!
Get up on that deuce, boy!
You don't need no special invitation, son!
Do as I ask!
Hoist that Gl ass on that deuce!
Let's go.
Get it done!
Get it done!
Private Bozz, Roland.
No middle initial.
You're going to infantry.
I bet my left nut they bag and tag you in a week.
Any man tries that hard to get out will never see home again.
I don't like the rehearsal, so I'll skip the show.
Fuck you.
Get on that deuce.
Let's go!
Bozz.
I got a buddy in Charlie Company says he knows a fellow by that name.
Says he's the biggest fuck-up in the Army.
Clowning around and always acting like fucking bozo.
Article 15, recycled through basic, all kinds of goldbrick shit.
Sounds to me like that fellow's no more than a goddamn coward.
Afraid of Tigerland, huh?
Should be scared.
They hump your ass until it falls off.
-l heard a guy from Bravo died there.
-No, man, that's a rumor.
You afraid of big old Tigerland, Private Fuck-up?
Read this and tell me what happens.
I gotta get away from this guy.
Go for it, Bozz!
Private Bozz!
What the fuck?
Stop the goddamn truck!
Goddamn it!
What the fuck is your problem?
You stupid motherfucker!
You're nothing but a--
Get back in that truck, you little fuck!
The rest of you motherfuckers, sit your asses down!
Good morning, gentlemen.
My name is Captain Saunders.
Commanding officer, Alpha Company.
Third advance infantry training brigade.
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.
No matter where you did your basic, either Fort Polk or elsewhere rest assured that we train the proudest, the toughest the best-equipped soldiers.
This base is the largest supplier of combat troops overseas.
So don't let any man here start having any little pasty fucking daydreams about being anyplace else.
I shit you not, gentlemen.
You are headed for a two-way firing range.
You will be sent to the war.
You will be here for an eight-week training cycle.
After that, you will remain here for a week more.
We will ship you to an outpost 10 miles from here that is known throughout the Army as the second worst place on earth.
Tigerland.
It is the stateside province of Vietnam and it is as close to the war as we can make it.
Now, gentlemen, it behooves you to learn what little we can teach you here.
For if you do, then maybe just maybe you will return one day to play stink-finger with Sally back home.
Let's get squared away.
Those of you not on detail will have a pass for the weekend.
Training begins Monday at 0430.
From that time on, every son of a bitch humps his own load.
-Sucky-sucky, baby?
-Oh, no, thank you.
There you go.
-You got a high sex drive.
-You're right.
Which line says that?
I'm no expert but it says you're gonna have sex real soon.
-What about me?
-Sex for Sheri as well.
There you go.
-Did you read it?
-No, I didn't.
Me, neither. I keep it around to piss everybody off.
Jim Paxton.
Let's not become friends.
You could die and I'd miss you too much.
Excuse me?
It's a joke. Forget it.
Roland Bozz.
This here is Sheri and Claudia or Claudia and Sheri.
Ladies, Jim Paxton.
-Pleased to make your acquaintance.
-Nice to meet you.
Charmed, I'm sure.
-Let me buy you ladies a drink.
-Right on.
Four, please.
-You girls from here?
-Born and bred.
You?
-Upstate New York.
-New York.
How about you, Bozz?
Where are you from?
Texas, Jim.
It's in the Southwestern part of the United States.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'll double-check that on the map.
Thanks.
They came down hard on you in company.
-l'm surprised they let you off base.
-They didn't.
-l'm confined to company air.
-Oh, you're AWOL?
Man, the children.
To peace on earth and a cure for cancer.
-Cheers.
-Amen.
Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.
Man, all I said was, "To peace on earth and a cure for cancer."
-Who said it's a joke?
-You're doing a routine.
A funny soldier with two girls in a bar--
Man, I'm not doing any routine.
If you're gonna be an asshole about it, fuck you.
Now, Jim, that's not the answer.
Oh, really, smart-ass?
Then what is?
The answer is, I got a hotel room.
We're gonna take these ladies and fuck till the war is over.
Okay.
Hello.
This is fun.
Oh, really, really fun.
-lt's not bad for a couple grunts.
-Not bad for a couple grunts?
Who are you?
Sergeant Rock, Easy Company?
Who are you playing?
Absurd man in an absurd world?
You're playing a fool fighting the system.
-There's a difference, Paxton.
-Really, what?
I'm a failed fool.
Yeah, you've got a rep.
I heard you're the biggest fool around.
Oh, well, thank you.
But that's it.
I'm still around when I should be out.
-And I'm gonna get out.
-Not me.
I enlisted.
-ls this some war shit again?
-Yes.
-l got the munchies.
-Me too.
I wish I hadn't heard you say that.
I was starting to like you.
You know, I thought a lot about it, Bozz.
I don't like the war.
Maybe I'm even against it.
But I'm not against my country.
Does this place have room service?
Where's the phone?
That's some fancy political thinking, professor.
Let me give you some advice.
Figure out a way to go.
-Get out, singing while you go.
-Guys, help us.
-We're hungry, you know?
-Me too, man.
You know, that's not all, man.
It's not just political.
I want to go.
I want to see what it's like.
I want the experience.
I'm taking notes on everything.
Shut up. I'm taking notes on everything.
One day--
One day I'll write something like James Jones or Hemingway.
What will you write?
That war is hell, men are brave, that kind of petrified crap?
So you've popped my fucking balloon.
Jesus Christ, Bozz.
I know a 24-hour place on Bourbon Street.
The girls are gone.
Yes, they are.
Okay.
Hey, how you doing?
Keep your head down.
Fucking AWOL piece of shit, son of a bitch.
That bag of shit of yours in the dirt.
Private Bozz is demonstrating the proper way to dig a hole under fire.
Under fire, you will fall to the earth and lie flat.
Under fire, you will ask God to remove your buttons to get closer to the ground.
Under fire you will dig a hole with your teeth if you have to.
Open your mouth.
Now, shitbird.
Do it!
Eat dirt!
I don't hear you. "Yes, sergeant."
-l'm still not hearing you.
-You wear a dress, sergeant?
-What did you say, you piece of crap?
-Go kiss my ass, sergeant!
You little finger-fucking cocksucker.
I will make you push Fort Polk into the sea!
Yes, sir, I already have a man in mind.
Thank you.
Eat dirt.
Do it!
Do it!
Eat dirt!
-Eat it!
-All right, sergeant, that's enough.
Get these men moving.
Move it!
You heard the man.
Let's move it!
Get going!
Miter, you're the new platoon guide, the 2nd Platoon.
Get Bozz in line. lf it don't happen even Jesus won't be able to save you, understand?
-Yes, sergeant.
-Have these men fall in and fall out.
Platoon, fall in.
Fall out to your weapons.
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz, Bozz!
What is wrong with you, private?
Move your ass, son.
Let's go.
Move it!
-Bozz.
-Let's go!
Get that bag of shit in the dirt.
That's mine.
On my mind
I'm still trying to find
I wanna take her home to my mama
Platoon, listen up.
Platoon, we got a heavy day tomorrow.
Everybody hit the racks.
Lights out.
-Lights out.
-You like being in control, don't you, boy?
I ain't took no shower. I gotta take one.
God, shut up.
I don't fuck with you when you're talking, so don't fuck with me.
Sergeant Thomas.
Private Cantwell reporting to the weapon shed as ordered.
Sergeant Thomas?
Glad you waited up for me, Dad.
I think everybody did, Bozz.
This the scene where the troublemaker gets beaten by his buddies?
Somebody got beaten.
Cantwell.
Jesus.
-What happened?
-l think it was Sergeant Thomas.
Damn it.
Anybody report it?
Why?
It's not gonna put his face back together.
He was trying to fuck around like you.
I'm sorry this happened to you.
There ain't gonna be no more clowning from you.
You hear?
Go wash up and hit the rack.
Shut your cake-hole, Miter.
You're giving Cantwell a headache.
I'm telling you, that's the same as getting an order from the sergeant.
Don't make me put you on report.
Give it a rest.
It's been a hard day for all of us.
Don't you give me a hard time, Paxton.
You're okay.
You'll be a good soldier, but this individual--
He wants to be a bumblefuck.
He wants to laugh at everything we do.
He'll hurt this platoon.
What are you, 20 years old?
Just because you wear sergeant stripes don't mean you ain't gonna die.
Where you going that we ain't, Bozz?
You best start to soldiering, boy, or you're coming home in a rubber sack.
Fuck.
Just wanted you to know, I've taken a great dislike to you.
-ls there anything else, Wilson?
-No.
I don't reckon there is.
I'm gonna tell you something. This is the last chance you'll get to hear it.
You can't kill a dink with a ricochet.
Oh, this is all about killing people?
Well, shit.
So you can shoot when you want to.
When I want to.
Idea of killing dinks excite you?
Cease fire.
Cease fire.
Get your targets, scumbags.
All clear.
You can't hit your targets, there'll be hell to pay.
Shit, I do believe that's Cantwell's target there, boys.
-Not a single bullet hole in it.
-Shut your cracker face, Wilson.
Sgt. Thomas'll chew my ass for chow.
You ain't gonna be making no phone calls home soon.
You gonna be busy.
All asses and elbows, picking up ciggie butts.
Wilson, you're a one-man campaign to make the world more ugly.
-l ain't afraid of you, Bozz.
-Yes, you are, Wilson.
-You're just too stupid to realize it.
-Okay then, Sunday school.
You're such a goddamn saint, give Cantwell your target.
-l'll give him yours.
-You take that and I'll--
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ is the purpose of this clusterfuck?
-Wilson switched targets with Cantwell. -That's true.
I saw him.
-That's bullshit.
-Lie down.
-Permission to--
-Now, shitbird!
Yes, sergeant.
You know why this man's on the ground?
Because he's dead!
He's dead.
And you can't bury him.
Do you know why?
-Why, sarge?
-Because you're dead too!
You're all dead because you don't know how to fire weapons on semi-automatic.
Or how to hit Charlie with short bursts so your goddamn barrels don't overheat.
And because this shitbag can't hit his fucking target.
Any questions?
-No, sergeant.
-l got a question.
If I'm dead, how come I can ask you a question?
I know exactly what you're doing, you pissant fairy.
I want you and your two girlfriends here to report to the mess sergeant after chow tonight.
Get up, Lazarus.
You're resurrected.
Get up.
Cantwell.
You're getting a lot less funny, Bozz.
There's some big old moon shining down.
Reminds you what this world is all about.
-What, peeling potatoes?
-lt's good you talk so slow, Cantwell.
Paxton there is taking notes.
Maybe he'll put you in a book.
Another one of his hokey characters:
the bumpkin saint.
I don't rightly know what you're talking about.
I don't read much.
Never got past sixth grade.
Got married.
Got a wife back home.
Poor little girl.
She has seizures.
These spells, you know?
Four children gotta go without a mama now and again.
Jesus, Cantwell, when did you get married?
When you were 12?
Hell, no.
I was 15.
We had two together.
She had two previous.
I'm 19, but she's a might older.
She's 28.
I got a little boy who's 1 and a little girl who's 2.
What the fuck are you doing here, man?
Don't it strike you how it's the same moon shining?
And it's shining down on us here and shining down on that little girl who's my wife.
It's the same moon that'll be shining when they send us to war.
Same moon that's shining down on those boys getting shot.
Don't it strike you what it means?
How each of us is a bit of everything.
And everything is shit.
I know that back home preacher be talking about right and wrong.
About the Lord and God and Jesus.
But you know if the Lord or God or Jesus be standing here right now he'd say, "Cantwell you forget about all these promises.
You forget about what all anybody say.
And you forget about all them big Sunday fancy ideas.
Even what we tell you.
You look up there."
Did you ever see such a moon?
Goddamn it, Cantwell.
Shit.
Fuck, I don't even know you, man.
You sitting there telling your fucking story.
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about?
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.
You shouldn't even be in this army.
You're just too stupid to get yourself out.
I told them my predicament.
They said, "Wait till you get to the war, complain there."
And you bought that?
The man said it.
I know Army regulations the way prisoners know the law.
You're a hardship discharge, man.
Okay.
Look, I'll get you out of the Army.
What are you saying?
You don't give a rat's ass about him.
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.
Just peel some fucking potatoes or something.
-One, two, three.
-Two.
-One, two, three.
-Three.
-One, two, three.
-Four.
-One, two, three.
-Five.
Who put you up to this, son?
Nobody, sir.
-l know my rights.
-No, you don't.
Your case won't be reviewed until after you're overseas.
Dismissed.
No, sir. I don't believe that's correct.
And I believe if you don't allow me to see a J.A.G. officer, sir then under the uniform code of military justice I can file a complaint with the inspector general.
And nobody can keep me.
Jesus Christ.
When did "My country, right or wrong" turn into "Fuck this"?
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.
I read it.
In a book.
You read it?
In a book?
Yes, sir.
How far did you get in school?
Almost sixth grade, sir.
I guess they study law early where you come from.
Sir, if I may speak frankly.
You underestimate the damage an individual like Bozz can do.
He's bad for the Army, sir.
Haven't you heard? Everything's bad for the Army these days.
Even war.
Now drive your knee through his face. Shove his brain through his ear.
Good!
Thank you, sir.
What's your solution?
Shit-can him out of the Army?
Of course not.
That's what he wants.
-Exactly.
-Court-martial him.
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.
Sergeant, you know we won't court-martial him.
It'll cost beaucoup dollars and Battalion will ask why I can't keep one asshole trainee in line.
Five weeks from now, he'll be in the war.
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad.
Sure as shit.
Maybe not.
Got Cantwell out.
Two of the guys of the last squad he was in.
Every son-of-a-bitch J.A.G. head-shrinking bleeding-heart pissed downstream on us.
That's Bozz, sir.
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.
Sergeant, we are losing a war.
The whole goddamn Army is falling apart.
You want me to fiddle-fuck around with one smart-ass barracks lawyer?
I think he's something more, sir.
-ls that all, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.
What the hell you doing, soldier?
!
Goddamn it, Bozz!
You're supposed to strangle him, not become his fuck buddy!
Yes, sergeant.
Pussy-fucking-coward.
What the fuck you looking at, you bunch of no-nut sad sacks?
Get your little pussies back to work!
You try that again, you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.
Now get those little pussies back to work you bunch of sad sack, no-nut fuck-ups!
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.
He's two steps from the poorhouse with a wife in the nuthouse. I envy him.
You saved his life.
Shit, sometimes when we talk, my stomach hurts.
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.
Know what would settle your ass?
A blanket party.
Put a blanket over you, hit you with a rock.
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.
-Both of you can walk back--
-You, Paxton you think you so damn smart.
I hear Northern boys are the first to go in Vietnam.
Yeah, but at least we can find it on a map.
Real fucking funny, Pax.
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.
Ain't nobody gonna die?
Shit, Miter, you're one damn dumb cracker.
When you go home, they'll call you "Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker."
-That any better?
-You watch yourself, mister.
I still got these stripes.
Acting sarge.
You're pretty chicken, paint a big old yellow stripe down your back.
-l ain't seen a dink that can take my legs.
-Jesus, Wilson, you're a dumb fuck.
Them motherfuckers killed the Chinese ass kicked the French's ass.
They're gonna kick ours.
-Who are you? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard"?
-My brother was there in '68.
Don't make you no hero.
You know what your problem is, Wilson?
You need to listen for the pop.
What's "the pop," Johnson?
The sound you'll make when your head comes out of your ass for the first time.
Damn, Johnson, I know you a damn coward.
Now I believe you a damn communist.
Maybe a damn faggot alongside being a goddamn nigger.
-Oh, hell no!
-Ain't this some shit.
-Want a piece of me, chump?
-Get him!
-Get him!
-Get off of me.
Get off, motherfucker!
Come on!
That's enough.
Which one of you motherfuckers killed my truck?
-Get off me, man!
-Get off!
All right, now, you truckload of shit.
Fess up, or the whole damn drag-ass squad does the airborne shuffle six miles back to base.
Goddamn it, shit for brains!
Who did it?
I did it, sergeant.
Good.
Come down here, boy.
And bring your shit!
Rest of you, sit your asses down.
Nobody saves anybody, you stupid son of a bitch.
What the fuck are you doing, man?
It's not doing me any favors.
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2 out.
Miter has properly demonstrated the use of the TA-312 field radio.
Except for this, which is not in the manual.
If you ever catch Charlie you might want info on where the rest of his buddies is.
Only Charlie is a close-lipped bastard who won't tell you fuck all.
That's why you tie his gook hands, take down his gook pants and grab his gook balls.
Here, Miter, hold these.
You pinch these clips on each of his slant-eyed nuts and you juice up the radio that'll send enough of a shock, he'll tell you anything you want.
Hell, he'll tell you the minor-league baseball scores.
-You read me?
-Yes, sergeant.
He'll tell you how his mother wipes her ass if you give him this juice.
Not only that, you'll be able to find him real easy next time.
Because he'll light up the fucking night.
No one said you could leave.
-Why?
-Why what?
Why would I do that to another human being?
Brother's right.
What the fuck's wrong with you?
That's one of your men.
Get him back here, boy.
-Bozz!
-Go get him, boy.
Jesus, Bozz.
Don't do this to me.
Get back here, you worthless sack of shit!
Bozz!
You can't control your own men, it is your ass.
Drop trou.
-What?
-Drop trou!
Double-time, come on!
Skivvies too.
Well, what do you know?
You do have a pair of balls after all.
-Wilson, get over here.
Crank this thing. -Yes, sergeant.
We'll now demonstrate the proper way to give information when connected to the TA-312.
See if you can tell me why you can't control your men.
See if you light up tonight.
-Light him up.
-Shut the fuck up, Hicks.
Contact.
Never even touched you, son.
That's it.
Class dismissed.
Go on to your next class.
Go on.
Go on!
Wilson, looks like we're having roasted nuts tonight, huh?
I didn't know you was so goddamn funny.
I can't wait to catch me a VC, spark his balls off.
I'll start with you tonight, Miter.
Getting this, Pax?
The crazed, sadistic soldier who flips out and kills people.
I think I saw you look at Miter's balls earlier.
Funny there, Bozz.
Funny, yeah.
You're a disgrace to the uniform, fucking piece of shit!
Hey!
Hey, what the fuck?
Break it up, man!
Get the fuck up!
Civilian bullshit!
What the hell is going on?
Miter!
You better do some fast explaining or your men in a world of hurt.
There was an argument...
-...and one of the men-- -Slipped on the soap in the shower.
Wrestling. lt got out of hand.
It happens when people live together, fuck together.
Sorry, soldier, you must've slipped on some soap yourself.
What's wrong with you?
Look like you ate some frozen shit for breakfast.
Nothing's wrong, sergeant.
It better stay that way, you read me? All of you.
-Goddamn it, do you hear me?
-Yes, sergeant!
You got guard duty.
Four listening posts at the edge of the perimeter.
Dig yourself a hole and forget about chow.
Out here, you're challenged on guard duty.
And you do it by the book.
But in Nam, if you hear something in the bushes I mean anything, you open fire.
You fire into those bushes until you kill whatever made that sound.
When the sun comes up, I don't give a fuck whether it's man, woman, child or little Johnny next door.
Kill it or you're not coming home.
Like the My Lai massacre, sergeant?
Paxton why don't you join your asshole buddy?
Missing a meal would be good for your wisecracking ass also.
Now let's fall back in for chow!
Goddamn it, do it now!
You want to march six miles tonight?
Fucking weapons at ease!
Feel like I'm digging my own fucking grave here.
When I was a kid I used to think I could dig my way to China.
You watched too many cartoons, Jim.
Maybe if we dig long and hard enough, we'll tunnel our way out of this dump.
Why don't you?
My arm's too tired.
No, really. Why don't you get yourself out of the Army?
I'm not that brave.
In that case, I'll just have to bury you myself.
Move it out! Come on, move it out!
Stay the fuck down!
Stay the fuck where you are!
Move!
You got to move it!
Stay the fuck down!
They're firing in our path!
-Move it!
-Cease fire.
Miter!
What the hell's wrong with you?
When your men are told to move out, they move out!
When I give orders, you're supposed to jump.
-Do you read me?
-Yes, sergeant!
The M-60s fired directly across our path!
They'd have cut us in two!
Who gave you permission to open your fucking mouth?
Miter's platoon guide!
You gotta flank that M-60!
ls that clear?
Yes, sergeant.
If you don't want these dumb-ass bitches dead you wouldn't take them in the belly of a pig with a 762 to split their skull!
You flank the objective!
-You read me?
-Yes, sergeant!
-Get these fucking men out the hole!
-Move it out!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Stay down!
What did you say, maggot-brained son of a bitch?
I said, stay down.
Get these men out the hole now!
-Platoon guide, do it!
Do it!
-Move it! Come on, goddamn it!
-Move it! -Stay down.
Are you stupid enough to fuck with me, boy?
Tomorrow at base it's you, me and the captain.
If your insubordinate ass ain't in stockade by midday chow I'll kill you myself!
You're not gonna kill me, sergeant.
I don't know what you'll do to me, but you won't kill me.
-Goddamn you, boy!
-Out of the trench!
Don't turn your back on me!
Get your ass with the other men now!
I understand your position.
I ain't trying to fuck things up for you.
You got your army to run and people to kill.
I'm not part of it.
Nobody quits the Army.
I'm not quitting I'm just not playing.
What's your first name, sergeant?
Ezra.
Can I offer you a smoke?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
-Yes, sergeant!
-That doesn't fucking do it!
That doesn't fucking do it!
Give me a fucking answer!
Fuck!
Now you listen to me, son.
I been to where you're going.
Over there, you go from living to dead awful quick.
What I'm trying to teach you may save your worthless life, maybe.
I tell you what.
If you snap shit and soldier like I know you can...
-... I'll forget about this.
-Can't.
Shit, even if I wanted to, I'm not there anymore.
What kind of bullshit statement is this?
Ezra, no.
It's just me.
Okay, Bozz, all right.
I'm gonna let you go.
But at garrison it's you and the CO, I'm out of it.
Soldier, this army's gonna come down on your ass hard. Both feet.
You know that, don't you?
They'll push through your papers and send you where the dying's sweet.
Is this a trick?
Trying to make me a hero or something?
Nope.
Well, good, Ezra.
Now you get your ass up and join these men right now.
You're a big fucking baby!
Get out of my sight.
-Miter!
-What's he doing?
-Sergeant Landers!
-Goddamn it, what is it now?
Miter!
-That's enough, sergeant.
-You got some fucking nerve, shitbag!
Come on!
Time to go home, soldier!
I said, that's enough!
Let's go.
Goddamn it, you men will learn to soldier.
The next dick tries a stunt like that gets my size-14 Deltas so far up their ass they'll choke on my boot heel!
-Do you understand!
-Yes, sergeant!
You!
Paxton!
-How much school have you had?
-Two years of college.
You're the next platoon guide.
Now put that man under arrest.
They didn't teach us how to do that in college.
Are you some kind of fucking idiot?
You inbred retard.
You don't know how to do a thing, do you?
Tell the man he's under arrest he's confined to barracks, he won't leave the area.
You get a card table and set it up at the door!
Why, sergeant?
So a guard can sit there, you backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.
You're fired as platoon guide, dumb-ass dipshit!
You think that's funny?
-No, sergeant! -Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
Give me 10, you think it's fucking funny!
-Wilson!
-Yes, sergeant.
Get a card table.
You're on guard.
Guard, sergeant?
You heard me!
You want these 14s up your ass?
No, sergeant!
Bozz.
You're new platoon guide.
You put that piece of shit under arrest.
You tell these men to get their haircuts. Every swinging dick.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sorry about that, Jim.
Oh, man.
Jealous?
Miter.
How you doing, man?
Okay, guys!
I ain't taking any of this shit seriously.
Just do what you have to do so we can live together.
If any of you are gonna run off and hide, let me know.
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army.
Hear me?
Sit the fuck down at your dumb card table, punk.
Hey, fellas.
Hey!
Look, all I know is that no one's talked to me like that since I got in this goddamned green mean machine.
-Damn right.
-l attest to that.
So yeah, Bozz.
See what happens, baby.
What else they gonna do, send us to Viet-fucking-Nam?
Too late for that.
Say, Bozz?
Can I get a weekend pass?
Put your panties away, your mama's panties.
They're your mama's panties.
You ain't been laid in three years.
Get me off this base, I'll show you!
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.
Take a deep breath.
Take this shit off.
You gotta relax.
Shit, you gonna run again?
I hear people in New Orleans help me get to Mexico.
It ain't that easy.
Army's got men, their whole job is to look for you.
I don't care.
They'll catch you, bring you here and put you in prison.
You best move, don't make me have to thump you.
Want to go to military prison?
That's not the crazy you are.
Shut the fuck up!
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake up Wilson.
You don't want that.
Shit.
What you gonna do now?
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.
-Shit, man, that won't work.
-Watch!
I said, that won't work!
Bust my hand, they'll have to let me out. Right?
-lt ain't gonna work.
-Come on, Bozz!
Break my goddamn hand so I can go home!
You know what I am, Bozz?
I'm a butcher.
Yeah, we all butchers.
No, I'm a real butcher.
-You haven't killed anyone yet.
-Goddamn it, I mean a real butcher.
Back home.
I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.
Did it in high school, did it after high school.
I could cut you a piece of meat so clean it'll have you praying to beefsteak.
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.
You laughing at me?
No, Miter.
I ain't laughing at you.
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.
I didn't make no money.
Just a store boy, that's what my daddy said.
"Hey, store boy.
Hey, boy!" Called me boy.
Imagine that?
Shit kicker, calling me boy all the time.
I ain't a boy, goddamn it!
Telling me how he's a big fancy war hero.
And my wife, that little--
My wife.
She's pretty.
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.
Prettiest girl in the state of Louisiana.
She was mad at me because I was working all the time.
Giving her the money for junior college.
I knowed that, like like I knowed later on she was seeing a fucking college boy on the side!
Goddamn it.
My daddy said it.
He said, "See?
See what a dumb-ass bastard you are?
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.
You ought to have a little ring in your nose."
So you thought you'd join the Army and kill yourself like a real man.
Bozz, I know you can get people out.
Maybe.
Even in this wild-ass nonsense, some rules fly by.
Please, Bozz.
Please get me out of here. Please?
Well, look here.
Goddamn.
That captain sure didn't want to let me go at first.
But I did like you said.
Told him the Army regs wanted me to see the base psychiatrist.
-And that was it, huh?
-l wanted to thank you personally.
Doctor sent me on leave.
He'll contact the Red Cross, get me out-processed so I don't have to come back.
Good, Miter.
Glad to hear you're nuts, man.
-Best of luck, Miter.
-Thanks, Paxton.
Miter.
Take care, Johnson.
Thanks again, Bozz.
-So long.
-Go be a butcher, Miter!
-Try not to get shot, hear?
-Don't let your meat loaf, man.
Yeah, fuck you.
-Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
-At ease.
I understand you're the new platoon guide for 2nd Platoon?
Yes, sir.
The fucking world is full of fucking surprises.
It wasn't your plan to wear sergeant's stripes a week away from Tigerland in a war.
I don't know, sir.
The idea crossed my mind now and again.
I just didn't think it would all be so pitiful sad.
Been looking over your 201.
You're a Texas boy.
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.
Dropout, worked construction.
-Get drafted?
-Yes, sir.
-Why didn't you stay in school?
-Maybe I needed some trouble, sir.
Well, you got it.
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.
The company's like the bad end of a shit storm.
Your platoon's the worst.
-Thank you, sir.
-That's not a compliment, smart-ass.
I don't want any more calls from Battalion asking me why this troopie needs a hardship discharge and that troopie needs some kind of a mental wet nurse.
-You understand me?
-Yes, sir.
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.
A week from now you'll ship out to Tigerland.
That'll crawl in your skull and look out your eyes.
So let's start fresh.
-Give your people a weekend pass.
-Already done it, sir.
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.
I believe you could soldier as well as any man in this army.
I even think you want to, but you won't.
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.
We're fighting a war, private.
Nobody knows how he's gonna come back.
That's not the kind of alive I'm talking about, sir.
Here's 150 bucks.
Happy Halloween!
Cough it up, Brian.
Next time, Pax.
-Catch you later, buddy.
-All right.
Who's that girl you're talking to, Bozz?
-Trying to score some weed.
-Know what I don't get?
Why they haven't tossed you out on some lunatic discharge...
-...some bullshit like that.
-l ain't crazy.
You're out of your fucking mind.
My reasons are my reasons and no one has to like them.
What about these fucking war games?
What if it's a lie?
What if the guys who tell you and me shit to do were lied to also?
Maybe since everyone believes in the same mistake, you know maybe they're all as confused as we are.
All this "Boy's boy, man's man" bullshit.
Ever feel you're just being stupid?
Yeah.
And it gives me a warm, gooey feeling inside too.
Oh, man, we need women, Pax!
We need song and prayers to the moon and deep breaths of the night wind.
Oh, I hear you, buddy!
No, Pax, I hear your asshole's tighter than a migraine.
-Fuck you.
-Hey, man.
You're Bozz, right?
Fellas say that if you don't want to go to Nam you better pray to Jesus or talk to Roland Bozz.
-Better start praying to Jesus, then.
-Sorry, kid.
-Oh, my God, look here.
-Oh, Jesus.
-l'm in trouble, I'm in trouble.
-You are.
-Come here, baby.
-l'll come if you got some money.
-l might have some money.
-You might or you do?
-You better have some.
-That's what I need to see.
-You want to see it?
-Yeah, I do.
-You got me covered, right?
-Here it is.
As I was about to come, I let out this enormous fart.
Should've seen her face.
Heard it in the next room. Thought a grenade went off.
-How was yours?
-Expensive.
-You feel guilty?
-Because I'm broke?
I figured you for a guy who left a sweetheart back home.
-She left me.
-That's why you joined the Army.
-Go on, confess.
-No, she broke it off when I enlisted.
-Didn't want to be a widow.
-She's got a point.
After all this bullshit you still want to go kill women and children in rice paddies?
-Come on, Paxton!
-Where you going, Bozz?
-l have no idea.
-Fuck.
-We are gonna jump, my young friend!
-Shit, Bozz, I'm too drunk.
-Come on, Paxton.
-l'll break my neck.
I don't want to go without you, man.
All right, I see what this is.
This jump, it's like this existential leap of faith.
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I have no idea what that means.
We'll break those legs and get out of the war.
-Okay, let's go.
-That's it, here we go.
-l'm ready.
-That's it.
It's gonna be on my count, it'll be one, two, three.
-Let's break those legs.
-Okay, one!
Two!
Three!
-Was that the count? -That was the count.
-Okay, okay.
-Here we go, here we go.
On my count again, one, two, three.
Okay, one!
Two!
Three!
The legs won't move.
Shit.
They're out for themselves.
Goddamn it.
If that bottle was a leg, we'd be out of the war about now.
-Looks like that would really hurt.
-Oh, fuck.
"Canadian Atlantic Railway." There's your ride out of here, Bozz.
Go to Canada and live with a fucking moose?
No way, man.
Mexico, that's where l'd disappear to.
Can't you just smell it?
See it?
Shit, I can smell it from here.
All that sunshine and tequila.
All those little senoritas walking around.
-Would you--?
-What?
If I told you there's people who can get us to Mexico away from the war, would you go?
No.
No, I wouldn't.
I enlisted, so there's a place for me.
If I don't go, somebody has to take that place.
And if they die, well they're dying for me.
You're a brave man.
-You're the brave one, Bozz.
-Bullshit.
Courage is when you're the only guy who knows how shit-scared you are.
Then you're right.
I am the brave one.
Let's get out of here.
We gotta get back.
Fucking Sergeant Thomas will chew my ass for chow!
-Anytime today, Private Paxton.
-l'm coming, Private Bozz.
Fuck.
We should have jumped.
Yeah.
We can always go back.
Come on, man.
Fight!
Calm the fuck down here!
Calm the fuck down!
Get him, Bozz!
Get him, Bozz, get him!
Let him go!
You're gonna hurt him, Bozz, let him go!
Let him go, Bozz!
Let him go! Come on!
Get off!
Goddamn it!
Damn you, Paxton.
Let them fight.
Shut the fuck up.
You know he deserved every bit of it!
Took four hours for my nose to stop bleeding.
Get off it, Wilson!
You had it coming, man!
-l was just fucking with him.
-lf Paxton here had kept quiet boy, you'd be in hell right now, sure as shit!
If I knew Bozz would stop, I wouldn't have said anything.
Apologize, Bozz.
Get off it.
You heard me, Bozz.
You apologize to me right now.
Yeah, Bozz.
Apologize to the man.
Say, "l'm sorry l didn't kill your ass!"
Think that's funny?
Fuck.
You tried to embarrass me in front of every fucking person here.
Apologize.
Cease firing!
Clear your weapons!
Weapons clear.
Next group on the line, let's move.
-Weapon safe?
-Yeah, all clear.
Take a mag.
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.
Firing line is ready.
Shooters, prepare to fire!
Fire!
Cease fire!
Clear your weapons!
-Weapon clear, Barnes?
-All clear, Bozz.
-The fuck you doing, Wilson?
-Killing me a Cong.
What the hell's going on?
Unload that weapon.
Head or the body, Bozz?
You choose.
Unload that fucking weapon!
-Head or the body?
-Damn it, unload that piece!
-Fuck you, Bozz.
-Unload that weapon!
Fuck you, Bozz!
Fuck you!
It's jammed.
Did you see that?
Did you see that?
Looks like a misfeed jammed it.
Well, you are one lucky dick, Bozz.
It would've killed you and the three people next to you.
-Hope you're not too disappointed.
-What do you want to do?
How about get Wilson as far the fuck away as possible, sir?
Well, you have the right to press for a court-martial.
Otherwise, you can let us handle it our way.
I'd personally prefer that option.
-Consider it a personal favor to me.
-Get Wilson out, sir.
I don't recall telling you to open your stinkhole.
He's right, sir.
Wilson shouldn't be in the Army.
Even if he did try to kill somebody.
You and I need to exchange some ideas.
That doesn't solve our problem.
We need to get him out now or we'll file for a court-martial.
Paxton, you're dismissed.
Yes, sir.
He's learning.
Bozz, do you think the Army's never seen pissants like you before?
I know you think you're some big swinging-dick hero.
I know a lot of the men think so too.
But I know you for what you are.
You are a coward.
You're a born leader and you're afraid to take any real responsibility!
That's why you dropped out of school, why you drop out of everything!
You're pissing your life away!
I don't need the fucking Army and I don't need the war to tell me that, sir!
Get on your feet, soldier.
Attention!
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.
I don't want you drummed out on some bad conduct discharge.
I want you exactly where you are.
And we'll just naturally chew you up.
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
-Shut your fucking mouth.
-You shut the fuck up.
-Guys, relax.
-l ain't starting.
You already got your ass beat once.
-Just watch your back in Tigerland.
-l'll do that.
I guess I'm supposed to joke about how I owe you my life.
-He almost killed you.
-You jealous?
You wanted to know what it was like.
What what was like?
The great lesson of being close to death.
Know what I know?
Same thing you know.
We're in a real bad way.
Fuck.
Real bad way.
All right!
Let's go!
Move it!
Come on!
Let's go!
-Come on! Move!
Move! -Move your ass!
Come on, fat boy!
Move your ass!
Let's go, soldier!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Welcome to Tigerland.
Your final training before you're shipped overseas.
Here, everything's done exactly as it is over there.
You will search and destroy, hunt and kill.
You'll move by chopper to secure any area deemed necessary.
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.
Minor mistakes will pay back major punishment.
Maybe you've heard we've lost this war.
Or we've lost the support of people here at home.
It's too late to ask those questions.
You're not back on the block.
You're alive in a year, we'll talk about it.
When you arrive in Nam it's important to get acclimated as quickly as you can.
Remember to think.
-You understand me?
-Yes, sergeant!
What matters now is sharpening your ability to find and destroy the enemy.
Practice how to stay alive.
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.
You're thinking you'll go somewhere safe.
You'll luck out.
Tigerland is where you stop bullshitting yourself.
Sarge, you got any advice on how to stay alive in Vietnam?
-l do, private.
Don't go.
-Right on, right on.
My friend here wants the experience.
Says he ain't scared.
Well, good luck.
If you ask me, I'll stick with the smart and the scared.
You'll be under the care of NCOs and officers who were in combat.
Listen to them.
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.
I've done two tours in Vietnam.
My first in '67 with the 101 st.
I just completed my second with MAC-V.
I only have two words of advice for you.
And those are to listen and to learn.
All right, let's saddle up.
Let's go!
Let's saddle up!
Let's go, goddamn it!
Get down!
Good job, Paxton. Good job.
Good job, Johnson.
All right.
Get your ass behind that tree!
Fantastic. You guys move like fucking soldiers!
Get your ass down!
Ryan, get your ass down!
Go! Move!
Move!
Bozz, keep that barrel out of the dirt!
Move, move, move!
Paxton, why are you slowing up?
Get your ass down!
You are the weak link!
This is not the time to slow up.
Adapt!
Overcome!
Move!
Get in there!
You good?
Why were you slow, Paxton?
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine, sergeant.
Diagonal, Private Barnes.
-So you don't chop your knee off.
-Yes, sergeant.
Go ahead, Paxton.
I gotta take a piss.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
"Jim Paxton on personal guide to pain."
Get that fucking torch out of my face and put that cigarette out.
You might as well hang a big neon sign that says:
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here."
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.
-Do you understand that?
-Yes, sir.
-Good.
-l'm still alive, sergeant.
-What did you say?
-l said, I'm still alive.
I miraculously survived the attack.
-You didn't get hit?
-No.
Are your friends alive?
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.
If you're gonna make up a story, make up a happy one.
I ain't making anything up, son.
And in Vietnam there are no happy fucking stories.
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan that I went to AIT with.
In '67, when the call came, we got sent off to Nam.
We had only been in country a few days.
We was green as grass.
We were in a two-man listening post, talking just like we are here.
Kelly lit up a cigarette.
One minute we were naming his soon-to-be-born child and the next second his brains were in my lap.
The sniper zeroed in on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.
Respect for your superiors and what they're trying to teach you.
Respect for yourselves and your unit.
And most important respect the enemy.
You have 42 minutes then the squad's on patrol.
Fuck.
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese village we could create for you here on the base.
Now, listen.
You're all gooks, so nobody speaks English.
Anybody asks you a question in English, you answer, "No bic."
It means, "l don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.
Good.
Private Bozz, you are the only man that speaks English.
Speak only to the man who identifies himself as interpreter.
Understood?
-Yes, sir. -Good.
Private Paxton.
You are the Vietcong.
Those boys come through here, their objective is to find the VC sympathizer.
In other words, you, Private Paxton.
They have five minutes.
You tell them nothing.
I warn you, they're beat up.
They've been awake three nights.
Forced marched all day.
They fuck this up, they'll march another six miles.
One other thing:
They find out which one of you is VC and you'll be the ones out in the boonies on no sleep, forced marching for the next two nights.
Understood?
-Yes, sergeant.
-Let's get to work.
Private Bozz, Paxton.
Over here.
Let's see....
Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.
Make it as realistic as possible.
This is not a fucking joke.
I like this.
It's like a war theme park.
I'm so tired.
I'm gonna pass out.
Hey, here they come.
Shit.
It's Wilson.
What?
-l thought we got him out.
-There's a war going on.
Plenty of room for psychopathic killers.
Let's move it.
We don't got much time.
We gotta find the VC.
Don't fuck with me.
VC?
Get your ass on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!
You VC?
You VC?
You VC?
How'd that feel?
Need an interpreter?
I'm the only one that speaks English.
How does that feel, Paxton?
What are you gonna write about now?
What are you writing in your journal?
Don't fucking move!
Let go of him, goddamn it!
-You're in charge.
On your feet!
-Yes, sergeant.
Where is your weapon, soldier?
There it is.
Why didn't you secure the area, Private Wilson?
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control!
Yes, sergeant.
Did you find any VC?
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.
Come here.
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.
Get out of here!
Let's go. Move!
-l'm gonna kill you.
-ls that right?
-Again? You gonna kill me again?
-l'll kill you.
Get your hands off him!
You want to go?
Get the fuck out of here!
-Get the fuck out!
-l'll break your neck!
-Let's move! -Get the fuck out of here!
Get out of here.
-How you doing?
-Shit.
Is he all right?
No, he's not all right.
Take your time.
-You going?
-l can't take you with me.
Not me.
Paxton.
He's hurting.
He signed up.
And you judged him for it.
You even made me feel guilty and I was drafted.
You saw what Wilson did to him today.
He's broken down.
And the Army didn't do all the breaking.
Take him.
It's ain't my fault if he waited till now to realize what he did.
I ain't got no time for sad stories but my own.
-Take him with you.
-Fuck off!
Wilson's gonna take his hate out on somebody.
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.
Johnson, I like you, but fuck off.
Yeah, well, I ain't standing in your way.
Rise and shine, gentlemen!
Let's go, gentlemen! Roll them!
Let's go!
Move!
Get on your feet!
I know you're tired, but you'll be doing a lot of this in the next year.
If you're not...
-...then you're lying still in a body bag...
-Where's Bozz? ...waiting for a dust-off.
Where is your squad leader?
Is this his weapon?
Does anybody know where your squad leader is?
Where is he, Johnson?
-Where is your weapon, Private Bozz?
-Right here, sarge.
I know that.
The next time you decide to take a piss or a fucking shit you make sure you have your weapon.
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it?
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think I'd need it.
Very funny.
You take point.
Paxton, take slack.
Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.
Listen up.
You'll square off against the boys from yesterday.
They may have booby traps.
They may have forward observers watching.
They may do all manner of shit that you don't know.
That's why you will keep your eyes open and your mouths shut.
-ls that fucking understood?
-Yes, sarge.
Let's move out.
-Welcome back.
-You owe me 150 bucks.
Hurry up, Paxton.
Let's go.
Dixie, dixie, my 12.
Dixie, my 12.
Move it!
Come on!
You okay?
Fuck, Bozz.
Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked?
Relax. You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
Wilson, what the hell are you doing?
That's live ammo.
Ambush!
12 o'clock!
Live ammo!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Fuck!
Private Wilson!
Private-fucking-Wilson!
Private Wilson, look at me, goddamn it!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Look at me.
You will place your weapon on safe!
You will raise your weapon above your fucking head or I'll blow your fucking brains out!
Oh, Jesus!
Do it!
On your fucking knees, now!
Get on your fucking knees!
You will be court-martialed!
Do you fucking hear me?
-What happened?
-An accident.
My fault.
Let me look.
Get him up.
Let this shit out. Now, bring it on.
I miss my grandma's apple pie
Shit, I miss getting high
And my Uncle Sam is sending me to die
You know what now?
Let's go, move it!
This war is not gonna last forever!
Bozz, bus number three!
You don't want to miss this war!
Let's go!
Hey!
Bozz.
-Want to come along?
-l wanted to, but you wouldn't let me.
How's your eye?
Got an injury bad enough to get out, no permanent damage. Imagine that.
More corny wisdom for your book.
"In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
Pretty fancy shooting, Tex.
Thank you.
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.
No, it wasn't.
Somebody had to take your place.
Bozz! Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.
Write me when you get there.
This is it, man.
No more phony Army buddy crap.
Go home.
Live a long time.
Try not to be too much of an asshole.
I'm gonna write a whole book about this.
Tell everyone about you.
Paxton.
Sergeant Thomas sorry for my misbehavior earlier.
Real sorry.
See you back here.
Take care.
-Watch your back.
-See you.
-l'll write a book about you, Bozz!
-No, you won't.
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.
Jesus!
Bozz!
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book!
What are you doing?
Shit!
Stop the bus!
What is this shit?
I never saw Bozz again.
Some guys said he died in Nam but he was never listed.
Some said he just disappeared over there.
One guy called and said he thought he saw him in Mexico with a beautiful woman.
But knowing Bozz he'd be pissed off I was talking about him anyway.
Okay, guys. Come on!
Separate the officers for interrogation.
I'll be damned.
General Spaatz, we meet at last.
Reichsmarschall Goring.
My wife. My daughter.
Your Eighth Air Force has destroyed my beautiful Luftwaffe and leveled our beautiful cities.
Even so, I prefer to surrender to a fellow airman.
May I?
Unbelievable.
Those pictures were on every wire service.
American officers throwing a party for Hitler's Number Two man.
What was the commander thinking?
I'm told that it's a code of honor among airmen that transcends politics.
- And brains, apparently.
- The commander was reprimanded.
Ike has ordered that Goring be treated no differently than any other prisoner.
Excuse me.
I finagled some real coffee from the Chief Justice's office.
Elsie's the best scavenger in the entire building.
You shouldn't have gone to such trouble.
Coffee's no trouble.
Now a set of tires, that's another story.
I still can't believe he's gone.
For me, it was like losing a father. Truly.
Whatever I have, whatever I am it's because of Roosevelt.
I was in London, seeing Churchill, when the news came.
With the end of the war in sight, the President sent me as his confidant to discuss a rather tricky subject.
What to do with captured Nazi leaders?
What was Churchill's opinion?
He said: "They should be summarily shot for crimes against humanity."
What's your opinion?
If it's a crime for the Nazis to shoot people without a trial how could it be less so for us to do the same thing?
That's Truman's feeling, exactly.
And Churchill now shares that view. Surprisingly enough, so does Stalin.
You're talking about a war crimes trial which they attempted after the last war, and it completely unraveled.
Because it had no weight.
This will be an international tribunal, comprised of the four powers: America, England, France and Russia.
President Truman wants the best prosecutor in the country.
One with a reputation for being tough, but impartial. He wants you, Bob.
I haven't prosecuted a case in years.
Roosevelt chose you for the Supreme Court because of your integrity as a prosecutor.
That's why Truman picked you for this. Because he wants a fair trial.
Not a legal lynching.
I like it right here, Sam.
This would mean I would have to step down.
A temporary leave of absence. You'd be back in six months, maybe seven.
is the President aware of the fact that I'm opposed to the death penalty? Yes.
But he's not concerned, because he knows you'll do whatever is right.
As you know, a fair trial means an uncertain outcome.
If we don't prove the defendants' guilt they'd walk, even if we could smell the blood on their hands. - Do the Allied powers understand that?
- Truman does.
You'll have a chance to make it clear to them.
The trial is yours to create, Bob. You get to set the rules, hire the staff, find the setting.
You even get to pick the defendants.
This trial could unravel, too like the last attempt, if it is poorly planned if it is unsound, legally or morally.
Or it could establish a basis for conduct among nations that would alter history for generations to come.
The trial will be held in Germany.
That's where the defendants are, the evidence, witnesses.
Are there any decent hotels still standing?
I don't relish the idea of spending months in some dreary army base.
You won't have to worry about that.
No wives allowed at Army's request. Bad for morale.
All those men over there for years without their--
You don't want me there, fine.
I'll be downstairs, whenever you're ready.
Eighteen minus three.
Fifteen.
I'm afraid I have to ask you to get dressed and pack for travel.
Where are you moving us?
Only the Reichsmarschall.
You're being transferred to Bad Mondorf.
Well, you know, it's a very pleasant spa, but why must I go alone?
Because that's where they're rounding up German war criminals.
I'm sorry about that.
Get dressed, please.
You must be brave.
Very, very brave.
Edda, you will?
We know who you are, Mr. "Jew Butcher of Krakow."
And we've seen the camps, too!
Nazi bastard!
I must say that I was lucky when the Arms Ministry was destroyed in an air raid in 1943.
It rid me of useless paperwork and pencil pushers.
What do you think was the single most effective thing you did during the war?
When Hitler appointed me his Minister of Armaments I threw out the military chiefs and turned to the professionals.
Industrialists and engineers.
Then I borrowed the ideas of Walter Rathenau the great Jewish chief of the German economy during the last war.
Standardization of parts the division of labor, and the maximum use of the assembly line.
Thank you, Dr. Speer.
Gentlemen, we'll now break for lunch.
Dr. Albert Speer. Obviously.
You're under arrest for major war crimes.
Move aside. Pay attention.
The orders are in. Listen up!
You'll all be taken to different places of detention. The following prisoners will go to Bad Mondorf as defendants in future war crimes trials.
Step forward.
Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel.
Grand Admiral Karl Donitz.
Colonel General Alfred Jodl. Follow me.
I haven't left Washington since the war. I couldn't even remember how to pack.
I was so worried about bringing the things for the office. I forgot half the things that I need.
I've one set of nylons for the entire time and they already have a run.
I even traded ration coupons with my friend so I could buy nylons. You are as jittery as a hen.
What is the matter with you?
I've never been up in an airplane before.
This is my chief secretary, Elsie Douglas.
Elsie, this is Tom Dodd, who'll be Deputy Prosecutor.
- lt's nice to finally meet you, Miss Douglas. - Pleasure.
Colonel John Harlan Amen, Head of interrogations. Miss Douglas.
Colonel Telford Taylor, our liaison with the other prosecuting teams. - Pleasure. - All mine.
And Colonel Robert Storey, Head of Documents Division. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Now that we're all here, let's go.
So who are we really after? Military leaders?
Political leaders?
What about the bankers and industrialists who funded the Nazis?
What about the soldiers and civilians who carried out the atrocities?
We can't put the whole country on trial.
We need to suggest the scope of the crimes. I want this trial to be the first of many.
How about choosing a symbolic figurehead from each category? We cover the whole spectrum.
- That way no one group gets off scot-free. - Makes sense.
If we win, we can keep prosecuting Nazis till the cows come home.
Remember, we may also fail to win convictions in which case, some or all of the defendants could go free.
I'm still wrestling with the validity of this trial.
Crimes committed during war have never been called crimes. Let's focus on existing law.
What existing laws did the Nazis break?
Well, they broke peace and border treaties, certainly Geneva and Hague Convention. Right.
Every time they invaded a country, they broke a law.
My fear is that at the end of the day, when all is said and done this trial will be perceived as nothing more than triumph of superior might.
The winners exacting punishment on the losers.
Our task is to make sure that this is not the triumph of superior might but the triumph of superior morality.
We're in a very interesting position here.
We are in a position to fashion a future in which aggressive war will be dealt with as a crime. Here, here.
New arrivals, identify yourselves. - Fritz Sauckel, sir.
- Head of Labor Conscription.
Former head.
- Julius Streicher.
- Publisher of...
- l can't pronounce it.
- Der Strumer.
It's filth.
You bankers are all Jews, you think I don't know that?
- Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht formerly President of the Reichsbank and Minister of the Economy.
I do not understand why I have been accused here. I'm your jailer, not your lawyer.
You'll get your day in court. Hans Fritzsche.
Chief of Radio Operations in the Nazi Propaganda Ministry.
Rudolf Hess, former Deputy Fuhrer. Hess. - You.
- Joachim von Ribbentrop. Nazi Foreign Minister.
You.
Colonel, this is Dr. Robert Ley, head of the German Labor Front. - You're Albert Speer.
- Yes, sir. - What's wrong with him?
- His mind's not what it used to be.
- He's a drunk, it finally caught up with him.
- l said, "Shut up! "
This man, Streicher, is a disgusting person. A pornographer and a Jew-baiter. - l do not wish to be housed with him.
- We make no distinctions.
Colonel.
We respectfully protest our arrest.
We were only following orders, nothing more.
As a fellow soldier, surely you must understand.
Now you're no longer a soldier. You are all war criminals.
All of you! Lock them up.
Nazi bastards! Where's the guard?
Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring at your service, sir.
You are in the United States Army Stockade at Bad Mondorf.
Did they tell you why you're here? Because we lost the war.
I assume, to be shot or hanged. It's up to the Court.
I've heard of this Court.
Its opinion doesn't concern me.
The opinion of the German people is what really matters. - ls that so?
- lt is so.
History will show that everything I did was for the greater German Reich.
There will be statues of Hermann Goring all over Germany in 50 years.
Little statues, perhaps, but one in every home.
You're fat as a house.
Starting right now, I'm putting you on a diet.
You will be mentally and physically fit to stand trial.
- Hans Frank, sir.
Tried to cut his wrists and throat.
They stopped him before he could do any damage.
"The Jew Butcher of Krakow."
Take him to the infirmary, have him checked out.
I want a four-man watch on him around the clock.
- On the double. - Yes, sir.
What's your name?
- Gilbert, sir.
- You and your men want to chow with us?
- Psychologist.
What we are faced with, or so it appears is the secular equivalent of drafting the Ten Commandments.
Each nation has its criminal statutes, but for the world at large, none exist.
None are necessary.
We're trying war criminals whose guilt is unquestioned by our governments.
If we're going to have a trial, it must be based on law. lt must be a fair-- lt must only determine degree of guilt and appropriate punishment.
A completely fair trial with opposing counsel direct examination and cross-examination.
Precisely. - Before judges that act as referees.
- As in a sporting match? Pain in the butt.
- That's not how it's done in my country.
- Nor in France. Lawyers merely help the accused prepare a defense. They have little role in the court itself.
In the U.S., a defendant is entitled to his lawyer's most aggressive representation.
You would allow a man such as Ernst Kaltenbrunner responsible for the Gestapo, concentration camps for killing millions of innocent people to stand before a court of law and declare himself not guilty?
That is precisely what we would allow.
Twenty million of my people were killed by these fascist criminals!
Half of them civilians, killed without mercy!
How many died in Washington this way, Mr. Justice Jackson?
It occurs to me that perhaps separate trials might be the most satisfactory way to reconcile our differences.
The U.S. and the British along with the French, if they choose will conduct a trial with the Nazis that we currently have in captivity.
Kaltenbrunner, Frank, Speer, Goring...
The Russians, of course, would be free to hold their own trial with the ones that you have on hand.
There is no need to be so impulsive.
We are, after all, allies.
We must try to bridge our differences.
At least the prosecution is a unified group now even if we did compromise with the French and let the judges be the jury.
I must say, your neat little trump card turned Comrade General into a pussycat.
I didn't enjoy playing it.
I didn't want to sandbag the poor guy. I would've preferred to convince him.
The old boy was quite convinced by your subtle reminder that we've got most of the big Nazi fish, while they only have a couple of minnows.
Nonetheless, I couldn't argue with his point.
My country was spared the worst of it. No bombed-out cities. No slaughtered children.
How can you look at all this and still want to guarantee these men a vigorous defense?
I want to put National Socialism on trial.
So they'll incriminate themselves.
Besides, I don't want this to happen again.
There's no question, you're the undisputed leader in this. Today proved that.
When we finish our work here, go to Germany, find a place for the trial.
If anything still exists, that is.
Robert, I can't believe this.
My brother came here as a college student. I still have the picture book he brought me.
It was nothing like this. This isn't even the same city.
There were medieval bridges and gingerbread houses.
This was also the site of some of Hitler's biggest rallies.
Nuremberg was the spiritual center of the Third Reich.
What are the odds of finding the housing we'll need for the thousands of people who'll attend the trial?
Army guarantees it.
Parts of this city were untouched by the bombings.
There's hundreds of fine houses. Some vacant. Others whose owners are desperate for money.
What's that smell?
There's still around 30,000 bodies trapped under the rubble.
- Ready?
- Yeah. Follow me.
The grand old Palace of Justice.
A landmark in more ways than one.
It took five bomb hits, but just shrugged them off.
The courtroom's upstairs. Offices, that whole wing there. And behind that wall, all the jail cells you'll need.
Right this way.
Justice Jackson, the courtroom.
This is a mess.
It'll take a lot of work.
- A lot of work. - But it's doable.
The Ten Commandments.
The Ten Commandments, in the place where the Nuremberg Laws were decreed that deprived all German Jews of their rights.
This is it.
This is the place to hold the trial.
Give me the word. I'll have General Patton move in 15,000 German POWs and start cleaning up the whole city.
I'm giving you that word right now.
Captain Kiley, what do you think?
I'll need to double the size of the courtroom. I'll have to take out that rear wall and cut into the attic for a visitor's gallery.
- l saw some terrific seats in an old theater.
- Great. The chandelier has got to go. Fluorescent's more practical...
The Palace of Justice is going to see justice once again.
Sir, this was just forwarded from the base.
- Thank you very much, Sergeant...
- Fuchs. Morris Fuchs, Brooklyn, New York.
Well, I knew it wasn't Wisconsin with that accent, Fuchs.
President Truman wants to appoint Francis Biddle as the U.S. judge for the trial.
Are you serious? He fired Biddle as Attorney General. Why would he do that?
Guilt, maybe. Probably.
- l guess, it's this instead of a gold watch.
- How do you feel about that?
Read Truman's wording: "Unless you have a problem with this."
- Which means-- - "Don't have a problem with this."
I've got to go back to Washington and brief Truman anyway.
I can stop in Philadelphia along the way and try to cajole Biddle to become a team player.
When do we leave?
I need you to stay here, set up our office, and find us a place to stay.
- Make those decisions without you?
- That'll be fine. I trust you.
When your name is called, get your ass on the truck.
When you board the plane, get a seat by the window, dear boy.
It maybe the last view we have of the fatherland.
I couldn't face going back into private practice. Not after all those years in Washington at the nerve center of the country, the war.
What is the current status in Nuremberg?
We're gathering evidence, choosing defendants.
We've settled on 22 men.
We've narrowed our targets to those who ran the concentration camps.
Good thinking, splendid.
The ones who gathered the slave labor, as well as those that used it.
Absolutely right!
The judges have a great deal of work ahead of them with the pretrial discoveries.
Well, of course, you'll be there to guide me through it.
I'm thrilled, Bob. it's an honor.
This means a great deal to me.
Am I safe in calling the President and telling him you've signed off on me? That I'm approved as Chief American Judge?
I'll arrange your flight this week.
We need you there as quickly as possible. We need to gear up fast. The trial's in one month.
We'll have dessert in Nuremberg.
I've got to say I find it a little unnerving walking past 300 German POWs carrying pickaxes.
You've got a bodyguard. Just let one of them try to mess with you.
You want the desk sideways?
No, light from the side gives him a headache.
You really take good care of this guy.
That's my job.
That's fine?
Perfect. Could you please find Captain Kiley? - l wonder if the filing cabinets are ready.
- Sure thing.
The first thing you must understand about these men is that they are war criminals.
Their rank means nothing.
There is to be no exchanging of salutes or any other military courtesies.
Now, I know most of you men saw combat.
You lost friends, companions.
We've all seen the bodies at the side of the road. Men who gave their lives in the service of their country so that we might have the opportunity to bring these criminals to justice.
Our job is to make sure that these criminals survive long enough to have that justice served.
To make sure that our friends, our companions, did not die in vain.
That'll be all.
On your feet.
Swab your cell.
I beg your pardon?
Der bucket.
And der mop.
Use them!
Pick it up!
Pick them up! Now!
Lieutenant!
Easy.
He'll rest now.
His heart rate was up to almost three hundred beats per minute.
It could've led to heart failure.
That's just great. That's just what I need.
To lose the biggest bull in the roundup.
- Lieutenant?
- Wheelis, sir.
I'm making this man your personal responsibility.
He is not to exert himself.
As God is my witness, he'll be in the best of health when they hang him.
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Wheelis.
With your permission, I shall call you: Leutnant.
- That's fine, sir.
- Thanks for the ride, Fuchs.
- No problem.
- Welcome back.
- lt's nice to be back.
It's really good to have you back.
So...
- Quite a job you've done here.
- You should see the inside. Come on.
Excellent work, Captain... Kiley.
Kiley.
What's your background, Kiley?
A couple of architecture classes. Never got a degree.
Neither did I.
Are you serious? You're a justice of the Supreme Court.
I practiced law for 20 years with only a single year of law school under my belt.
Things were easier back then.
- You shouldn't give away your secrets.
- l won't tell if you won't tell.
How are we doing with the gizmos for the simultaneous translation?
ibm's inventing the process as we go, sir. But we'll be ready for you, I promise.
I don't doubt that.
Question is, "Will we be ready?"
The whole team's waiting in our office. They'll fill you in.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
When I was home, I couldn't find a phone number. I couldn't find a document.
Now you won't have to worry about that.
I'll take Goring. Should be fun.
Tom, I'd like you to do Speer.
I'd also like you to take von Schirach and Funk. Good.
- Are the indictments ready to be served?
- l say we hold off till the last moment.
As it is, we get to treat them like POWs. We can interrogate them all day long.
Once indicted, they're entitled to have their lawyers present. This is going to be a fair trial.
Let's serve them as soon as possible.
Let the British deliver the indictments.
It's not right for us to hog the whole show.
- What if they want Nazi lawyers?
- What crazy example would that set?
For crying out loud, boys! Nazis defending Nazis. They ought to be on trial themselves.
We have to pay them?
I wonder what these fellows would do if the situation was reversed.
We don't have to answer that question in this room. The judges will be here in one week.
We'll let them decide.
This just arrived from Biddle.
He's decided not to fly. He's coming over on the Queen Elizabeth.
He'll be here in three weeks.
I'm a bit surprised at Biddle.
I'd never seen a man so hungry for approval.
Well, yeah, but then you approved him.
I did learn a lesson there, didn't I?
And how I hate learning lessons.
Don't you think this is a bit excessive?
I got it for a really good price.
Justice Jackson, meet Frau Hassel and Herr Hassel.
How do you do?
I have lived five years in America.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Frau Hassel.
Please, come in.
Follow me, bitte.
I will prepare dinner. Something light, perhaps, at this hour.
"Light" means five pounds of lard in the dumplings instead of six.
Who owns this place?
Some banker who no longer owns a bank.
I think we're his only source of income. Come on.
Thank you, Herr Hassel. I'll do that.
So where is your room?
Upstairs. It's a cute little attic-apartment type thing.
is it all right?
Well, it's nicer than what I have in Washington, Bob.
I haven't seen what you have in Washington.
Oh God, I am so bushed.
Just hold on till dinner. Would you like a drink?
No, maybe later on.
Don't do that.
I've arranged a breakfast meeting with the team tomorrow morning. Good.
Just to go over some finer points.
You sure pack well, Bob.
Thanks.
Start with this one.
- l hope I shan't make a balls of it.
- You'll be just fine, old chap. Open up.
I am Major Neave.
I am the officer appointed by the lnternational Military Tribunal to--
- You're British? - l am.
Finally, a civilized man.
Neave.
What is your given name?
Airey.
Major Airey Neave.
I have heard this name before.
Airey, like the wind.
Why would I have heard this name?
I was captured, tortured by the Gestapo, and escaped twice.
Then you've earned your given name.
I am the officer appointed by the lnternational Military Tribunal to serve upon you a copy of the indictment in which you are named as defendant.
I'm also here to advise you as to your rights to counsel.
I care nothing for lawyers.
You can find one for me, Major Airey of the wind.
We're men of culture.
We both know the truth.
The victors will always be the judges. The vanquished, always the accused. Yes?
Open it up.
Until I've studied this, I cannot speak to the accuracy of the charges against me.
But I acknowledge the necessity of this trial and accept my inclusion in it.
How can you say that before reading the charges?
There's a common responsibility for the crimes committed in the name of the Third Reich.
No one is blameless.
Apart from the victims.
But we were just following orders!
I know nothing about crimes against humanity.
- Here's a list of lawyers.
- Jews! They're all Jew names!
I want to be defended by a German naval officer.
I was a lawyer myself, full of ideals.
Why don't you just shoot us now?
Why don't you shoot us now?
I want a guard posted at the porthole of every cell. They are to be watched around the clock!
I will not have them taking the easy way out!
- l need to pick up a document. - l'll meet you in the office.
- Find any directives on Polish slave labor? - Take your pick.
There's something peculiar about the German character.
Makes them keep detailed records of everything they do.
It's downright perverse.
The Nazis put into writing every criminal thought they ever had and every criminal act they ever did.
In this room is enough evidence to hang half the country.
I'll settle for 21 clean convictions.
- Get what you need? - More than.
I've arranged all your random notes for the opening statement into something less random.
Legal, Thematic, Anecdotal, Precedent, Theory. You're really something.
When you decide what, let me know.
I don't believe this.
I've noticed that this case has inspired the orator in you.
I tried to capture a tone, a mood, for the entire case.
A melancholy grandeur, if you will.
Well, it's all here.
You have a something right here.
We only have two days to finish the speech.
Maybe you should start dictating.
Right.
This simultaneous translation business is like taking a room in the Tower of Babel.
I can assure you, whoever designed those electronic earmuffs-- Earphones, Sir Geoffrey.
Earphones.
Whoever designed them did not try them over a barrister's wig! Not to worry.
On you, they'll be most becoming. That'll change my style...
Who's that over there?
He's a psychologist.
The army transferred him here to consult on the suicide risks among the prisoners.
I had arranged for a flight to pick you up. You were meant to be here two weeks ago. What happened?
You developed a craving for shuffleboard?
I just I needed time to get up to speed.
I worked the whole way over. I'm fully prepared. Any of my colleagues here?
I'd like to meet them. Perhaps later on.
I need to talk to you about something.
- You must take some vodka. - No, thank you.
- Try it. lt makes it strong. - l am content with the cognac.
- We do it all the time in Russia.
- You can't mix it.
- We do it in Russia all the time. - Not in France.
Thank you.
Look at this, Bob.
It was a gift from my family.
After the trial I will donate this, along with my papers, to my alma mater.
- l think future generations-- - Francis...
On the subject of who will serve as President of the Court the British are prepared to support you, but...
It's not in the best interests of the trial.
The Americans are far too dominant in this thing already.
The trial must be viewed as a joint effort.
- l really do have the qualifications. - l know you do.
If not me, then who?
Sir Geoffrey Lawrence.
The British share our sensibilities.
That's a lot better than having de Vabres or, God knows, Nikitchenko.
I think I can sell the French on this idea too.
Everyone back home assumes that I will be head of the Court.
Francis, your role here will be of incredible importance.
This is probably the last appointment of my career, Bob. This is how I'm going out.
With great honor.
Francis, you'll be capping your career with great honor.
Now that Ley's done himself in who should we get to replace him in the dock?
It's not a Broadway show. We don't just bring out an understudy.
We've still got 21 left. lt's a good number. Boys, they are coming back.
- Biddle doesn't look too happy. - Can you blame him?
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Judge Francis Biddle.
Pleased to see you.
Ladies and gentlemen.
A salute to my colleagues in the law.
How fortunate we are to be in a profession where we may speak our minds.
Not like diplomats who must behave like dogs on a leash.
To the law!
I was wondering if you'd care to dance with me? I'm not much of a dancer.
Well, let's go embarrass ourselves.
It's my opinion head-shrinking has no place in this man's army.
But you've been assigned to me, Captain, and I plan to make full use of you.
You'll help me stop losing any more of my prisoners.
From what I know of your set-up here I can say that you've created the perfect suicide ward. What are you talking about?
These men have nothing to do all day but think about their faith.
They should.
To keep them alive and sane they need to be occupied, mentally and physically. - A small library, for instance.
- Library? Would make all the difference in the world.
So would an exercise yard.
I had something quite different in mind.
Put you in their lives. Give them somebody to talk to, open up with.
They'll surely jump at the chance to jibber-jabber with somebody as bright and enthusiastic as yourself.
They'll tell you what they're thinking and planning.
You'll report everything you hear to me.
Colonel-- l will not hear anything about morals and ethics. These men are prisoners.
Criminals.
Not patients. That's the deal, Captain.
Take it or leave it.
The library and the exercise yard, sir? You got it.
This place is worse than I expected. What a nightmare.
- Where do we pick up our press passes?
- The Palace of Justice.
What's the metal bar on the front of the jeep do?
It cuts the wires that Germans string across the road at night.
Several Gl's have already been decapitated. Lovely.
Here we are, gentlemen.
I'll take your bags to the hotel.
All right. Thanks a lot, buddy.
Have press credentials ready to show. You will be given press passes and transferred to assigned lodging.
Get in line, gentlemen!
Check this out.
Nice and tight, please.
We better go sign in.
- Rudolf, you put it on the wrong foot. - What? The shoe.
Na ja.
Hess seems completely mad. It is an act.
He is being clever.
If he was so clever, he wouldn't have spent the last four years in an English prison.
I turned my diaries over to the Americans, voluntarily.
That proves that I tried to resign as Governor-General of Poland.
I did not approve of the persecution of the Jews.
Anyone reading my diaries, they will know what was in my heart.
They will understand that those things I wrote about the Jews the orders I signed they were not sincere.
I believe you, Herr Frank.
And yet, you did do those things.
How do you explain it?
I don't mean legally.
I'm not a lawyer or a judge. I mean, how do you explain it to yourself?
I don't know.
It's as though I am two people.
The Hans Frank you see here, and Hans Frank, the Nazi leader.
I wonder how that other Frank could do those things.
This Frank looks at that Frank and says:
"You are a terrible man."
And what does that Frank say back? He says:
"l just wanted to keep my job."
When we begin this grotesque farce tomorrow, my friends never forget that we're here for one reason.
And one reason only. We lost the war.
But someday, a grateful German nation will honor our legacy.
What do you have if you have one German? You have a fine man.
Two Germans, a Bund.
Three Germans?
Are you really in such a good mood, Herr Goring? Or is this your way of handling fear?
What do I have to be afraid of?
I've ordered thousands of men into battle knowing full well that not many would return.
Why should I, their leader, tremble when called upon to face the enemy?
I know that I'm a condemned man. That is of no consequence.
There is still work to be done.
And, mark my words, it will be done.
One Englishman? An idiot.
Two Englishmen?
A club.
Three Englishmen, an empire!
I spoke with the translators today to get a sense of the pace you need to maintain.
It's tricky. lt's not just about pace. It's about rhythm, pausing at the end of phrases. We should rehearse a little tonight.
Not the whole speech. You need to save your voice.
This is unbelievable.
It's time to go, Reichsmarschall.
How do I look?
You look fine, sir.
How do you feel?
Excited. I have waited many months.
Many months of silence.
Now at last I'm being heard.
- Shall we?
- l'm not allowed to do that, sir.
Yes, of course.
All right, Sergeant, search the cells.
Sir Geoffrey.
With my respects.
Bless you, Biddle.
After you.
All rise!
This trial, which is now to begin is unique in the annals of jurisprudence.
The defendants, all having been served with copies of the indictments are now to enter their pleas.
Hermann Goring.
I have a statement which I will now read to the court.
The defendants are not to make a speech.
They are only to enter a plea.
I declare myself, in the sense of the indictment, nicht schuldig.
Not guilty.
Rudolf Hess.
Record that as "not guilty."
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.
- Wilhelm Keitel.
- Ernst Kaltenbrunner.
- Alfred Rosenberg. - Nicht schuldig.
- Hans Frank.
- Wilhelm Frick.
- Julius Streicher. - Nicht schuldig.
- Walther Funk. - Nicht schuldig.
- Hjalmar Schacht.
- Karl Donitz.
- Erich Raeder.
- Baldur von Schirach. - Nicht schuldig.
- Fritz Sauckel.
- Alfred Jodl. - Nicht schuldig.
- Franz von Papen.
- Arthur Seyss-lnquart.
- Albert Speer. - Nicht schuldig.
- Konstantin van Neurath. - Nicht schuldig.
- And Hans Fritzsche. - Nicht schuldig.
All the pleas have now been entered.
Justice Jackson.
Your opening address, please.
May it please your honors.
The privilege of opening the first trial in history for crimes against the peace of the world imposes a grave responsibility.
The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated so malignant, and so devastating that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their being repeated.
That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason.
If these men are the first war leaders of a defeated nation to be prosecuted in the name of the law we agree that here they must be given a presumption of innocence.
We accept the burden of proving criminal acts and the responsibility of these defendants for their commission.
We have no purpose here to incriminate the whole German people.
Hitler did not achieve power by majority vote, but seized it by an evil alliance of revolutionists reactionaries and militarists.
You will hear today and in the days ahead of the enormity and the horror of their acts.
The prosecution will give you undeniable proofs of these incredible events.
I count myself as one who received, during this war, atrocity tales with suspicion or skepticism. No more.
The catalogue of crimes will omit nothing that could be conceived by their pathological pride, cruelty, and lust for power.
You will hear of the repression of organized labor. The harassment of the Church, the persecution of the Jews. The conversion of mere anti-Semitism into the deliberate extermination of the Jews of Europe.
You'll hear of the long series of German aggressions and conquests and broken treaties.
The terror that settled over Germany. The havoc wrought on the occupied territories.
And you'll know that the real complaining party at your bar is Civilization.
Civilization asks whether law is so laggard as to be utterly helpless to deal with crimes of this magnitude by criminals of this order of importance.
It does not expect that you can make war impossible.
It does expect that your juridical action will put the forces of international law its precepts, its prohibitions and, above all, its sanctions on the side of peace.
So that men and women of good will in all countries may have leave to live by no man's leave, underneath the law.
The court is now adjourned.
Jackson's speech? Pedantic.
Tiresome lot of nothing. I nodded off twice.
The food is better today.
Do you think they'll feed us like this every day?
They always feed you well before they hang you. That's so true. They can't hang us.
We're soldiers.
They have to shoot us. Stop this talk.
We must concentrate on our defense.
If you are not going to eat, Frank, give it to me.
Look what they have done to your beautiful city.
- Nuremberg is not mine.
- But it was. Was anything ever more extraordinary than the Parteitagen you staged in September?
The night skies lit up like a bonfire as we carried our torches through the streets. A quarter million of us on our way to the Zeppelin Fields.
I remember standing there for hours, basking in the radiance of the Fuhrer.
Then I would take a group of my Hitlerjugend to the river where we'd would bathe together. We'd cool off from the fires that were burning within us.
But now that just seems like a dream.
A strange, wonderful, frightening dream.
It was not a dream, it was a nightmare of our own making.
And it's time to wake up from it. The look in Hitler's eyes was not radiance, it was madness.
is the British prosecution ready?
Yes. indeed we are. Your Honors, with permission I wish to read from a sworn affidavit by one Hermann Friedrich Graebe. A German construction manager who, in a civilian capacity was employed by the German Army in occupied Ukraine from 1941 to 1944.
On several occasions he observed the mass murders of local Jews committed by the SS or Schutzstaffel, the Nazi party's police and security organization.
One such occasion he writes, took place on October 5, 1942 near the city of Dobno.
That morning, Herr Graebe was informed that all 5,000 Jews from that city were to be taken by SS trucks to a place near his building site where they were to be shot and buried in large pits.
He continues.
"Thereupon I drove to the site and saw near it great mounds of earth.
"Several SS trucks stood in front of them.
"l heard rifle shots, in quick succession...
"Those who had just got off the trucks, men, women and children of all ages...
"...had to undress upon the order of an SS man, who carried a whip.
"All these people had the regulation yellow patch on their clothes...
"...and thus could be recognized as Jews.
"And without screaming or weeping...
"...these people undressed, stood around in family groups...
"...kissed each other, said their farewells.
"l watched a family of about eight, a man and a woman...
"...with their children and two grown-up daughters.
"An old woman with snow-white hair was holding the youngest, perhaps a year old...
"...in her arms and singing to it, tickling it, and the child was cooing with delight.
"All the people around were looking on with tears in their eyes.
"The father was holding the hand of a boy about 10 years old...
"...and speaking to him softly.
The boy was fighting his tears.
"The father pointed to the sky, stroked the boy's head...
"...seemed to explain something to him.
"At that moment, the SS man at the pit shouted to his comrades.
"The latter counted off about 30 persons and instructed them...
"...to go behind the earth mound. "Among them was the family that I have mentioned.
"l well remember a girl, slim and with black hair, who...
"...as she passed close to me, pointed to herself and said:
"'Twenty-three.'
"l then walked around the mound, and was confronted by an enormous grave.
"People were closely wedged together and lying on top of each other so that...
"...only their heads were visible.
"Nearly all had blood running over their shoulders.
"Some of the people shot were still moving.
"Some were lifting their arms and turning their heads...
"...to show that they were still alive. "The pit was at least two-thirds full.
"l estimated that it already contained about one thousand humans.
"The victims, completely naked...
"...went down some steps which were cut out of the clay wall of the pit and...
"...clambered over the heads of the people lying there...
"...to the place where the SS man had directed them.
"They lay down in front of the dead or injured.
"Some caressed those who were still alive...
"...and spoke to them in low voices.
"Then I heard a series of shots.
"l looked back into the pit and saw that the bodies were twitching.
"The heads lying already motionless were on top of the bodies that lay...
"...beneath them.
"When I walked back, around the mound, I noticed another truckload had arrived.
"This time it included the sick and the infirm.
"An old, very thin, very frail woman...
"...with terribly thin legs, was undressed by the others who were already naked...
"...while two people held her up. "The woman was obviously paralyzed.
"The naked people...
"...carried the old woman... "...around the mound...
"...and the shooting continued."
Signed, Friedrich Graebe.
Did any of you ever hear of this Graebe?
Rough day, Reichsmarschall?
On the contrary. We had an excellent lunch, a nice view of the city. And in the courtroom, we had the best seats in the house.
Cuffs off!
They go on about this Graebe person.
It doesn't concern us.
We were not even mentioned. They must have very little evidence against us.
I always suspected the British prosecutor was a Jew.
Now I am sure of it!
- Shut up, Streicher.
- Please, don't be so na.ive!
We are on trial! Of course they'll say terrible things about us.
Happy dreams, Leutnant.
Good night, Reichsmarschall.
Your Honors, I would like to read into the record Document 294-PS which describes manpower initiatives and how they were directed.
You have already read into record eight nearly identical documents on this subject.
Do you really feel it's necessary to introduce a ninth?
Yes, your honor, I do.
Very well.
Document 294-PS begins as follows... I have come to the conclusion the sentences are already being carried out.
Justice Jackson means to bore us to death and is succeeding beyond his hopes.
Now the Fuhrer, what a speaker!
At a rally, here in Nuremberg he held an audience of 250,000 people in the palm of his hand for an entire afternoon.
As legal strategy your documentary approach has been unassailable.
But as drama, it is, I regret to say, absolutely stultifying.
As you know, it's not meant to be entertainment. lt's meant to be a trial.
- And it's ours to lose.
- A trial is a show, Robert. Like it or not, it's a show.
And those four learned men sitting on the bench are as impressionable as any audience.
You're pushing for witnesses?
Witnesses will give this trial a human face.
One compelling witness can outweigh a ton of documentary evidence.
Mr. Pachelogg, while you were imprisoned in Dachau were you at one time asked to participate in a medical experiment?
Yes. And the Nazi doctor who supervised that experiment, Dr. Rascher did he ever explain to you its purpose?
He said the Luftwaffe had a problem.
That its pilots shot down over the North Sea often survived a crash in freezing waters only to die later, after being rescued.
The purpose of the experiment was to prevent these deaths.
And what experiment did he devise?
First, I helped to strip other male inmates naked and put them into water tanks.
You were forced to do this to fellow inmates?
And then?
Then we added large pieces of ice.
We put thermometers into their rectums to make sure the men were freezing.
Then, some of them we plunged into hot water others in warm water, others we put next to naked female inmates so the doctor could learn which method would best revive them.
Mr. Pachelogg, would you be so kind as to read this conclusion from Dr. Rascher's meticulous records.
"Rapid rewarming was, in all cases, preferable to slow rewarming...
"...because after removal from the cold water...
"...the body temperature continued to drop rapidly.
"Rewarming by animal warmth was too slow."
Mr. Pachelogg, do you recall whatever became of the subjects of Dr. Rascher's experiments on behalf of the Luftwaffe?
Most of them went into convulsions and died.
In 1942, I was arrested, interrogated and ordered to sign a false confession.
I refused. The German officer threatened me.
I told him, "l am not afraid of being shot."
He said, "We have means at our disposal which are far worse than being shot."
Please continue, Madame.
Soon afterwards, I found myself packed with 230 other French women in a sealed train on our way to Auschwitz.
A sealed train? No food, no water.
Nothing.
At Auschwitz, the trains ran almost all the way to the gas chamber.
They unsealed the cars and the soldiers let everyone out.
I saw men, women, children, old couples forced to part from each other.
Mothers made to abandon their children.
None were aware of the fate that awaited them.
Those selected for the gas chamber were immediately driven to a red brick building.
I saw my friend, Annette, on that truck.
She called to me.
"Think of my little boy if you ever get back to France."
Then she put her arms around another French woman and they began singing La Marseillaise.
One night, we were awakened by horrible cries.
The next day we learned that the Nazis had run out of gas and the children had been thrown into the furnaces alive.
Of the 230 women on that train how many returned from Auschwitz?
Forty-nine.
Thank you, Madame.
You're excused.
There you are.
The film came in late last night, and I was up until dawn watching it.
Very few people have seen this film.
You have got to enter this into evidence this morning.
What's the film?
You're not going to believe this.
May it please the tribunal. The United States now offers a film into evidence.
It was compiled from motion pictures taken by Allied military photographers as their armies liberated areas in which concentration camps were located.
It was such a nice day, laughing, joking and then they showed that horrid film.
Propaganda.
Anyone can do it. A little of this, a little of that, and before you know it...
Still...
Those films... I've read any number of affidavits, reports, statistics.
I still don't understand.
I don't think I ever will. How could civilized human beings do that to other civilized human beings?
Maybe civilization's overrated.
I cannot help asking... shouldn't the Fürer had stood by us and share responsibility instead of killing himself?
You would have the Fürer stand before the court and be subjected to the same humiliations which we must endure?
You cant!
you fool!
You are giving them what they want! they want you to think like defendants.
they want you to stand up and say you were wrong.
They would do anything... offer you anything to hear this words.
to save ourselves are we willing to betray the Fürer?
that I would rather die gladly than say we were wrong am I all alone?
betray the fatherland?
I say to you all...
Dr. Speer, help me understand what I witnessed today in the dining room.
Goring's ability to dominate and intimidate without possessing a real shred of power.
How do you explain that?
Habit. instinct.
Something in the German character that responds to authority real or imagined.
- That's all it is? - Yeah.
What about the ideas he expressed? The words, thoughts, they had no impact?
What ideas? What thoughts?
There were only platitudes.
Nazi Germany was built on empty platitudes.
A man like you, you were seduced by empty platitudes?
Of course.
Because you can hear in them any meaning you want.
You said earlier you wanted to tell me something.
I've been trying to encourage some of the other defendants to join with me in accepting guilt and expressing remorse.
I made progress with Frank, and I have had high hopes for young von Schirach.
But Goring means to bully them into joining him.
And I fear now, he will succeed. Unless someone stops him.
I understand.
All rise.
Herr Goring, do you believe that the Nazi party came into power legally?
And I am happy to explain in detail the history of those first elections.
But I will add that once we came to power, we were determined to hold onto it under all circumstances.
We did not want to leave this any longer to chance to elections and parliamentary majorities.
It had always been our plan once we came to power that we would eliminate the Reichstag dissolve the regional parliaments, end individual rights.
Where did the idea come from to combine the ceremonial head of state and the head of government in one person, Adolf Hitler?
That's quite simple.
We took our example from the similar dual roles of the President of the United States.
And the idea for concentration camps?
The idea was mine.
It was a question of removing danger. Only one course was available. Protective custody.
How could the party rule until it had established order?
And how could it maintain order with its deadly enemies particularly the Communists, running free?
No further questions.
I don't get it. He's tightening the noose around his own neck.
He doesn't care. He has bigger fish to fry.
He's talking over the heads of the tribunal directly to the German people.
I suggest you isolate him from the others when they're not in the courtroom.
I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
Inside.
I'm just following orders.
During cross hit Goring quick and hard. Put him on the defensive right away.
Never let him breathe.
I see no point in that at all.
He's blatantly incriminating himself.
All I need to do is ask direct questions and let him answer them.
Be prepared with a tough line of questioning.
In case it's needed.
Why am I being punished like a schoolboy?
Speer?
Speer's behind this. He must have talked to Colonel Andrus, persuaded him into this line of action.
How do you know it wasn't me?
Why Dr. Speer?
is there rivalry between the two of you?
He is ashamed of being a Nazi. I'm not.
He wishes to infect the others with his shame.
You have no shame?
The world has now seen proof of the horrors committed by Nazi Germany. You are comfortable defending it?
I've seen so many horrors already. The carnage of the First War thousands of my countrymen maimed, degraded, starved.
No, my dear doctor.
I am not an inhuman monster who has no regard for human life.
These atrocities are not indifferent to me.
You know, we are accused of so many appalling acts it is hard to keep track.
- Did you try?
- My concern was war.
And in war, each nation has its own selfish interest.
You have to be practical.
I am a practical man.
And I'm a soldier.
And a soldier's code is obedience.
This amuses you?
Blind obedience without responsibility.
is there nobody in this country that will take responsibility for anything? Nobody who can say no?
Take a look at every cell in this block. What do you see?
Yes men.
All the no men are six feet underground.
What is this?
You're not Jewish, are you?
Yes. I am.
I see.
This is a very interesting situation.
For both of us.
Good luck, old boy.
So, what's his plan?
I haven't a clue.
Will the witness repeat this oath after me?
"l swear by God the Almighty and Omniscient..."
"...that I will speak the pure truth... "...and will withhold and add nothing."
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?
You are perhaps aware that you are the only living man who can expound to us the true purposes of the Nazi Party and the inner workings of its leadership.
I am perfectly aware of that.
You, from the very beginning together with those who you were associated with intended to overthrow, and later on did overthrow Germany's previous government, the Weimar Republic?
That was my firm intention.
And upon coming to power you immediately abolished parliamentary democratic government in Germany.
We found it no longer to be necessary.
is it not true that people were subsequently thrown into concentration camps without recourse from the courts?
You must distinguish between two categories.
Those who had committed a treason against the new state were turned over to the courts.
Others, of whom one might expect such acts but who had not yet committed them such as functionaries of the Communist Party who were attacking us--
You answered the question.
I need to explain further.
You'll have the opportunity to explain under re-examination from your own counsel.
Did you prohibit all court review of the cause for taking people into what you were calling "protective custody"?
That I answered very clearly, but I'd like to make an explanation about my answer.
Your counsel will see to that.
About the camps-- Mr. Justice Jackson.
The Tribunal thinks the witness must be allowed to make what explanation he thinks right in answer to this question.
The Tribunal thinks that you should be permitted to explain your answer now and it will listen to that explanation.
I want to say that I issued a decree that those who were turned over to the concentration camps should be informed after 24 hours of the reason and allowed an attorney after 48 hours.
This by no means rescinded my order that a court review of these measures was not permitted.
By "protective custody" you mean taking people in custody who had not yet committed a crime but you believed might commit a crime in the future?
Yes, just as extensive protective measures are being taken in Germany today-- l didn't ask you about Germany today.
This is poor preparation.
The witness may finish his explanation.
You say that you were against the attack on Soviet Russia.
Yet you gave no warning to the German people. You brought no pressure to bear to prevent it. You did not even resign to protect your place in history.
We were at war, and such differences of opinion could not be brought before the public during war.
This was the case in your own country.
- Your second question--
- That'll suffice.
I'm not finished. Secondly... Your Honor, please.
The witness must be allowed to have his say.
As far as my resignation I do not wish even to discuss that for l was an officer, a soldier.
- l ask you-- - Thirdly-- Your Honor, please!
Thirdly I was not the man to forsake someone to whom I had given my oath of loyalty every time he was not to my way of thinking.
Your Honor-- lt never, ever occurred to me to leave the Fuhrer.
The witness is adopting a contemptuous attitude toward this Tribunal which is giving him trial that he never gave a living soul nor dead ones either!
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm ready for the next question.
I think this is probably a good point to adjourn for the day.
Tough calls from the bench.
Well, it's only Round One.
If you think you need anything, don't forget, I'm here.
As the week ends, there's a consensus among all present that Hermann Goring now appears to be in control of the court.
Will Jackson? Will anyone be able to stop him?
Yes, Bob?
You know, Judge, I didn't leave the Supreme Court to come here and be thwarted by a fellow countrymen.
That sounds like sour grapes.
Very unbecoming.
To an outsider, it might appear like you were trying to sabotage me.
You gave Goring an open forum during direct examination.
I must be able to control him during cross.
Just accept the fact that you weren't at the top of your game today.
You have the weekend to prepare for the next round.
Make good use of it.
- Not hungry, sir? - l'm too excited to eat.
Did you hear what I said? My reply when he asked me why I did not resign?
I lectured him about loyalty!
You should have seen Jackson's face.
It was a completely foreign concept to him.
If I didn't know better, I would say Jackson was a Jew.
Keep it.
My initials, see? Engraved.
It's real nice.
I'll never forget this. I know, Leutnant. I know.
Sit down.
You know, my friends call me Tex.
All right, Tex.
Let me tell you something, Tex.
America will soon learn that they are backing the wrong philosophy.
We should both be together fighting the forces of Communism.
- You think? - Yeah.
You think? - Yeah.
- l think we both agree, no? - Yeah.
I'd like to dictate a telegram.
President Truman, the White House.
"Please accept my resignation as Chief Prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials...
"...and appoint a replacement at the earliest possible-- "
I'm not writing this. I won't.
You saw today that I'm not up to this task.
I could stay, out of pride, and unravel everything we've all worked so hard for. Or I can step aside--
Bob, you are this trial.
Everything it is, everything it represents, is from inside you.
Your thoughts, your values.
I tasted failure today and realized what it would mean.
The only way they can triumph over you is if their values are stronger than yours.
If they believe in their ideals more than you believe in yours.
is that true, Bob?
Does Hermann Goring actually believe in his ideals more than you believe in yours?
You're right.
And thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, look here. What happened wasn't entirely your fault.
God knows, I'd be hard-pressed to defeat a clever defendant who's allowed to say whatever he wants for as long as he wants.
Now that you've finished with the niceties, let's have the truth.
Well, it was very damaging, Robert.
You've introduced this trial from a position of moral superiority. And as a result, you've become its chief symbol.
If you can't maintain that or if the balance shifts ever so slightly it could be a disaster.
Hermann Goring is using this trial to present himself as a philosopher-statesman on Hitler's level.
Do you see Goring as a statesman?
No, I do not. I see him as reprehensible.
As inhuman.
Then treat him as such.
Treat him as the vile, conniving bloody fascist bastard that he is.
Where the hell is he? He'll be here.
Mr. Chief Prosecutor, if you are ready.
From the very beginning, you regarded the elimination of the Jews from the economic life of Germany as under your jurisdiction, did you not? Yeah.
The elimination from economic life, that is partly correct.
Large industries, also armament industries under Jewish directors.
Was that the first of your legal measures against the Jews?
I believe removal from office was first, in 1933.
Then, in 1936, you personally drafted an act making it punishable by death to transfer property abroad?
That is correct.
And another that all damage caused to Jewish property by the anti-Jewish riots of 1938 must be repaired by Jews at their own expense with their insurance claims forfeited to the Reich.
I did sign a similar law. Whether it was exactly the same, I...
And did you not say about those riots... I show you this transcript.
Did you not say, "l wish you had killed 200 Jews... "...instead of destroying such valuables"?
That was said in a moment of bad temper and extreme excitement.
Spontaneous sincerity, in other words.
Did you not also personally sign a decree in September, 1940 ordering seizure of all Jewish property in Poland?
I assume so, if the decree is there.
And another, which provided that Jews receive no compensation for damages caused by enemy attacks or by German forces?
If the law bears my name, then it must be so.
is this your signature?
It appears to be.
is it, or is it not, your signature?
It is.
Your signature on a decree dated July, 1941 asking Himmler and Heydrich and the SS to make plans for the "final solution" of the Jewish question.
That is not a proper translation.
I said "total" solution, not "final" solution.
These are your words to Himmler:
"l charge you to send me before long an overall plan concerning...
"...the organizational, factual and material measures necessary...
"...for the desired solution of the Jewish question."
is that an accurate translation of this order from you to Heydrich and Himmler?
That had to do with emigration and evacuation of the Jews.
You ordered all government agencies to cooperate with the SS in the final solution of the Jewish question.
There's nothing in there about the SS.
This document states you personally ordered all government agencies to cooperate with the SS.
You sent this letter to SS Gruppenfuhrer Heydrich.
That doesn't mean that the SS had anything to do with the solution to the Jewish question.
Would you mind repeating that?
I must say this clearly.
I did not know anything that took place or the methods that were used in the concentration camps later.
These things were kept secret from me.
And I might add that in my opinion even the Fuhrer did not know the extent of what was happening.
Witness, there is evidence before this court that nearly 10 million people have been exterminated.
Murdered in cold blood.
You mean to say that you did not, and in your opinion, Hitler did not know what took place in the concentration camps?
Do you know that Hitler said in 1943 in a recorded meeting, I read you his words now. Quote: "The Reich's Minister of Foreign Affairs...
"...declared that the Jews should be exterminated...
"...or taken to concentration camps.
"There is no other possibility."
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ribbentrop talked with Hitler about extermination. And you were above Ribbentrop.
You were Hitler's second-in-command.
You were in charge of the economic Four Year Plan so you knew all about the gold wedding rings the gold teeth and the gold eyeglasses that the victims left behind.
And you have heard that it took five extra minutes to kill the women because they had to cut their hair off to be used in making mattresses.
And nothing was told to you about this material that came from these people that had been murdered?
How can you imagine such a thing?
I was laying down the broad outlines of the German economy.
- The witness is excused. - l'm not finished!
- The witness is excused.
The witness is excused.
You know what would've been a great touch? Hermann Goring showing up in a Santa outfit.
He'd probably do it.
After all, he was the Third Reich's chief bon vivant.
Did you ever see pictures of him at Hitler's mountain retreat dressed like a Tyrollean chorus boy out of some grotesque operetta?
Leaving so soon?
Some of the defendants asked me to come by tonight. A little Christmas Eve chat with their rabbi.
You know the trial is about to enter a new phase, a very important one.
The defendants will have to choose between stonewalling and evading or taking responsibility for their actions.
Now, you are the best chance we have to influence that choice.
Frau Hassel?
is something wrong?
Do not ask me to serve the Russians. Please. They're our guests.
My son was killed on the Russian front.
Okay. I'll take care of this.
Go to the kitchen.
Try these little sausage things, General.
I forget what Frau Hassel calls them, but I hear they're mighty tasty.
20 million of my people were killed by the Germans.
Do you think I could be offended by the snub of a Hausfrau?
I don't know what to think, General. Frankly, I can't keep track of all the politics in this room.
The Russians sure don't disappear in a crowd, do they? Politics.
They've suffered more in this war than any other country.
Must be doubly painful to attract such little sympathy for them.
And Jackson decreed no wives could come along.
Worked out quite nicely for him, wouldn't you say?
Merry Christmas.
This was a very nice gesture.
I figured it's probably their last Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Colonel.
- Field Marshal. - Doctor.
How are you?
I'm so glad that you are here.
Please, sit.
You are the only one I can really talk to.
But you don't talk to me, Field Marshal.
- l tell you everything about my family.
But not about you.
I would like to understand how a man like you a man of your background could have drafted an instrument like the Commando Order.
Allied soldiers found behind enemy lines were shot rather than captured? Or the Night and Fog Decree:
suspected Resistance members were arrested in the middle of the night and secretly murdered.
Because of you.
I know. I am dying of shame.
Don't you think it's time you admitted that to the rest of the world?
I'm not in the mood, all right.
Get off of me. Get off!
You were signing orders that broke international laws and treaties.
How could you not question what you were doing?
Does a lieutenant say to his captain, "Just a minute, sir, I have to consult... "...the Hague Convention to see if I am allowed to carry out your orders?"
If we had disobeyed, we would have been arrested. Rightly so.
You realize without the support of his generals, Herr Jodl Hitler could not have waged war.
It is a soldier's duty is to obey orders.
That is a code I have lived by all my life.
And that code extends to the people who ran the death camps?
Tex, my friend.
- Thank you. It's good to see you.
I know that Christmastime can be a lonely thing away from home. Merry Christmas, Reichsmarschall.
My dear Tex, what luxury.
So what would you be doing now back in Texas?
On Christmas morning, we'd open our presents and then go to church.
Then, we'd head over to Grandma and Grandpa's for a big roast turkey dinner.
After that, Dad, Grandpa and me we'd go out back hunting for pheasant, quail. Hunting!
Hunting was my passion!
I was Germany's chief gamekeeper. No kidding.
The shooting around my estates at Carinhall was wonderful.
Did Hitler ever go hunting with you?
I shouldn't tell you this, but Hitler did not approve of hunting.
He felt that killing animals was immoral. - He was a vegetarian.
- Yeah? Yes.
Yeah, but that did not stop him from being the most gracious host in Europe.
His dinner parties were legend. Always the finest caviar and champagne.
Thought he did not partake, he was not intolerant.
He would dazzle his guests with every view under the sun until dawn.
I remember once we were celebrating the triumph of Compiegne where we savored the sweet revenge of the French having surrendered in the very same railway car that the Germans had capitulated in, in 1918.
That must've been something.
It was, believe me.
You know I have made my career as a military man and I have to say you remind me of some of the finest young German soldiers who served under me.
Hello, America. As Christmas descends upon this sad and broken city I'm here, inside her great Palace of Justice.
And on this Christmas Eve, as we're filled with thoughts of peace on Earth it is here that the future of peace may well be determined.
Herr von Ribbentrop, would you agree that as Foreign Minister you forced Czechoslovakia to surrender its territory by the most intolerable threats of aggression?
I do not agree. You threatened to send your army in. In overwhelming strength.
And also bomb Prague. What further pressure could you possibly have put upon them?
War, for instance.
What is that but war?
Ribbentrop should be hanged for his stupidity.
That is the greatest crime of all.
In your newspaper, Herr Streicher you wrote that the Jews are "a nation of bloodsuckers and extortionists."
Do you think that's preaching race hatred?
No. I do not think it's preaching race hatred.
It is simply a statement of fact!
Dr. Funk you were President of the Reichsbank during the war?
I was, yes. And you accepted unusual deposits into your bank, didn't you?
I do not know what you refer to.
I am referring to deposits sent to you by the SS from concentration camps.
I have no knowledge of... Inside the Reichsbank vaults, there were literally piles of jewelry. Gold watches, gold earrings, gold eyeglass frames. And gold teeth!
Many people deposit valuables in a bank and the bank is not required to look into them.
Prior to 1939, exactly how many of your customers deposited their teeth into your bank?
You've heard a guard at Mauthausen concentration camp testify that you watched while the gas chamber was demonstrated on inmates.
I never set foot in Mauthausen!
And we have heard eyewitness testimony from three people that you were at Mauthausen three times.
They are lying! And before he died the commandant at Mauthausen signed this statement that you ordered him to put 65,000 Jews in a tunnel and seal it off rather than allow them to be liberated by the Allies.
He is lying! is it not a fact that you are lying to the Tribunal about this as you lied about everything else in your testimony?
That is also a lie!
Kaltenbrunner has asked the commandant of Auschwitz testify in his defense.
- lf that's a joke, I don't get it.
- l don't get it either, but it's no joke. The British have him in custody and agree to transfer him here to testify.
Maybe he just figures he'll look better by comparison.
We're not going to allow this, are we? Let the guy walk in, say God knows what on the stand, give Kaltenbrunner an alibi?
Might be a cheap price to pay for the opportunity to cross-examine him.
During the entire time you were commandant of Auschwitz did Ernst Kaltenbrunner ever visit the camp?
No. Not once?
One minute, please.
Mr. Hoess. How long were you commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp?
From the beginning.
And what was its purpose? At that time to house prisoners who were being held in protective custody.
And after that? I was called to Berlin by my boss Reichsfuhrer Himmler, in 1941.
And he informed me that the Fuhrer had ordered the final solution of the Jewish question.
I was not sure what I was supposed to do.
So Adolf Eichmann advised me to visit a camp at Treblinka to learn from its operation.
And what did you learn there?
Actually, I was not impressed.
It was taking the commandant there six months to eliminate 80,000 Jews using monoxide gas.
I had a better idea.
One of my Auschwitz guards had accidentally sniffed a chemical disinfectant called Zyklon B and had passed out immediately.
It occurred to me, if a little of this chemical killed lice enough, perhaps, would kill a human.
I tested it on Soviet prisoners of war locked in a room, and it worked.
Within 3 to 15 minutes, they were dead.
And then? I built gas chambers to accommodate 2,000 inmates at a time... And I built four large ovens to cremate the remains.
It became possible to eliminate 10,000 people in 24 hours.
But that was at peak operation, which was exhausting for my staff.
On the average, we would dispatch 2,000 people a day.
How many men did it take to dispatch 2,000 people a day?
I had a staff of approximately 3,000 men.
And during your tenure at Auschwitz how many people did you dispose of in this fashion?
Approximately two and a half million.
No further questions.
I wish to make this clear. I did not tolerate gratuitous cruelty.
My men were there to exterminate people, not torment them.
Any misconduct by the guards was punished.
The witness is excused.
Court is adjourned until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
My life was entirely normal.
Even while doing this extermination work I would say I led a perfectly normal family life.
How would you describe that life?
I've always been happiest alone.
I never had any real intimacy with my parents, my sisters--
Do you feel that the Jews you murdered deserved their fate?
I have always been taught that the Jew was an enemy of Germany.
So when you were ordered to turn your prison camp into a death camp you never once thought what you were doing was wrong?
I was an SS man.
We were trained to obey orders without thinking.
Does a rat-catcher think it is wrong to kill rats?
A rat catcher catching rats.
is that the kind of thinking it takes to carry out state-sanctioned mass murder?
Not just blind obedience, but also a belief that your victims are not human?
Let me ask you this.
What was Hiroshima?
Was it not your medical experiment?
Would America have dropped bombs as easily on Germany as it did upon Japan, killing as many civilians as possible?
I think not.
To an American's sensibility a Caucasian child is considerably more human than a Japanese child.
America was at war with Japan. A country that had attacked it without provocation.
You murdered millions of your own citizens.
What about the American citizens of the Japanese race put into "protective custody" in your own concentration camps?
That was wrong. Why was this not done to Americans of Italian and German descent?
I said it was wrong.
What about the Negro officers in your own army?
Are they allowed to command troops in combat?
Can they sit on the same buses as the whites?
Segregation laws in your country and anti-Semitic laws in mine: Are they not just a difference of degree?
Let me tell you, from the beginning of the century through the First War until the rise of Hitler the freemasonry of the Jewish merchants consistently undermined the German economy and the nationhood of the fatherland.
And why you, my friend, can never understand anti-Semitism. Why? Because you are a Jew.
is defense counsel ready to proceed?
Ready, Your Honor.
Herr Sauckel, from March, 1942, you were in charge of procuring labor for the war effort. ls that right?
Ja. You are aware that it was a crime under the Hague Convention to forcibly deport citizens of other countries to Germany as workers?
Ja. How many foreign workers came into Germany during your tenure?
Approximately five million.
And how many of them came voluntarily?
Perhaps 200,000.
Did you issue these directives calling for their decent treatment?
I did.
I ask that these be marked as exhibits and accepted into evidence.
So ordered.
Herr Sauckel, who ordered you to procure these workers?
Speer.
Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments. He gave orders to you?
Ja.
- And you had to obey them? - Ja. Every worker you brought in, it was under Speer's orders?
It was. No further questions.
I know this is unorthodox, Mr. Dodd, to request an audience with you the man assigned to cross-examine me.
There's nothing very orthodox about this whole trial, Dr. Speer.
My lawyer's trying to talk me out of confessing to war crimes that might incur the death penalty.
I do not wish to hide the truth just to save my life only to hate myself for the rest of that life.
- l wish other defendants shared that view.
- Some of them do. Many are still under Goring's influence.
He's your chief rival for the souls of other defendants if I may put it so dramatically.
Goring was cross-examined by the chief prosecutor, Justice Jackson while I am to be questioned by you, a subordinate.
This difference was noticed by the other defendants.
In their eyes, it puts me in an inferior status to Goring.
That's a peculiar measure of status, Dr. Speer.
Not to a German war criminal.
I hope you don't have a problem with it.
No. I've got no ego riding on this.
I'll present your request to my superior, Mr. Jackson.
Dr. Speer, did you disapprove of Sauckel's recruitment of labor?
On the contrary.
I was grateful to Sauckel for every worker he provided.
When we failed to meet armament quotas because of shortage of workers, I would blame Sauckel.
Do you wish to limit your responsibility to your own particular sphere of work?
This war has brought an inconceivable catastrophe.
As an important member of the leadership of the Reich I share in the total responsibility for the disaster of the German people.
Dr. Speer, near the end of the war, did you not refuse to carry out Hitler's order to raze Germany to the ground?
I've no intention of using my actions during that phase of the war to help me in my personal defense.
But I would like those who sit in judgment of me to understand that period.
In March of 1945, Hitler intended, deliberately to destroy the means of life for his own people if the war were lost.
He said, "Let the Allies conquer nothing but ashes."
But you resisted his wishes, sending him instead this memorandum.
Would you read it to the court, please?
"Nobody has the right to destroy industrial plants...
"...coal mines, electrical plants, and other facilities.
"We have no right to carry out destruction which might affect the life of the people.
"Signed, Speer."
We have heard here that people were shot for disagreeing with Hitler.
is this true?
That did happen.
And yet, not only did you disagree with him but early in 1945 you actually made a plan to assassinate Hitler.
is that not so?
Yes, it is so.
It is so because of what I viewed as his insane destructiveness.
What did you do?
I knew of an air-intake shaft in the Reich Chancellery garden that ventilated the Fuhrerbunker below.
I went to the head of my munitions department and said:
"There's only one way to end this war." and asked him to get me a poison gas to drop into the ventilating system.
But the next time I went there, they had built a 12-foot chimney protecting the ventilator, and SS guards were patrolling there.
So it came to nothing.
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?
You acknowledge responsibility for Germany's large policies but not for the details occurred in their execution.
- ls that a fair statement of your position? - Yes, sir.
Very fair. May I ask the witness a question in order to clarify this answer, please?
You may.
Do you want to acknowledge guilt under criminal law or do you wish to record a historical responsibility before your own people and before history?
The question is a very difficult one to answer.
It is actually one which the Tribunal will decide in its verdict.
You would assassinate the Fuhrer?
I tell you this, coward.
If you get out alive, we'll put together our own court and execute you for treason!
As a German officer, I consider it my duty to answer for all I have done.
It will not always be possible to separate guilt from the threads of destiny. But the men in the front lines cannot be charged with guilt while the highest leaders reject responsibility.
That is wrong.
It was my guilt which I carry before God and the entire German nation that I educated the youth of Germany for a man who I considered to be an impeccable leader and head of state.
But I educated the youth of Germany for a man who committed murder a millionfold.
And this guilt of Germany will not yet be erased.
The prisoners aren't allowed visitors.
I am the wife of Reichsmarschall Goring.
This is his daughter.
No exceptions, ma'am.
Frau Goring.
- My name is Captain Gilbert.
- Hello.
Nice to meet you. Would you have a moment to spend with me, to talk?
- Very good.
- This is Edda. Hello, Edda. I'm Captain Gilbert.
Do you like chocolate?
It must have been very difficult for you these last few months.
Especially with your little girl.
It could have been worse, I suppose.
Hitler could have survived.
You've obviously come to terms with the truth.
I wish your husband could do the same. But he persists in remaining loyal to Hitler's memory.
Yes, I cannot understand it, either. Such loyalty to a man who wanted us dead.
- l'm sorry?
- Hitler ordered all of us to be shot. Hermann, myself our precious child.
That is why we surrendered to the Americans.
Why else would we have done such a thing?
I went through my notes last night.
I've spent all these months trying to find a way inside their minds. Hoping to understand how those people could commit such atrocities against my people.
I believe there are a couple of factors that explain a lot of it.
First, Germany is a country where people do what they're told.
You obey your parents, teachers, clergymen, superior officers.
You're raised from childhood not to question authority.
When Hitler comes to power, he has an entire nation that believes it's perfectly natural to do whatever he says.
Second, propaganda.
For years, Germans have been bombarded with ideas like: "Jews are not real human beings," or "They're a corruption of the race."
When the government says it's permissible to deny Jews their rights and then says it's imperative to kill these inferior people they comply.
Even if they've been your friends or neighbors.
Anything else?
I told you once that I was searching for the nature of evil.
I think I've come close to defining it.
A lack of empathy.
It's the one characteristic that connects all the defendants.
A genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow man.
Evil, I think, is the absence of empathy.
I call on the chief prosecutor for his closing argument.
Mr. President and members of the tribunal. It is impossible in summation to do more than outline with bold strokes the vitals of this trial's mad and melancholy record. For no time has ever witnessed slaughter on such a grand scale.
Such cruelties and inhumanities, such wholesale deportations of peoples into slavery, such annihilations of minorities.
Events which will live as the historical text of the 20th century's shame and depravity.
Terror was the order of the day.
Civilians were arrested without charges, committed without counsel executed without hearing.
Villages were destroyed, the male inhabitants shot or sent to forced labor and the children scattered abroad.
The Nazi movement will be of evil memory because of its persecution of the Jews the most far-flung and terrible racial persecution of all time.
So thorough and uncompromising was this program that the Jews of Europe as a race, no longer exist. Thus fulfilling the diabolic "prophesy" of Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the war.
Generations to come will remember this decade.
If we cannot eliminate the cause and prevent the repetition of these barbaric events this century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization.
The time has come for final judgment and if the case I present seems hard and uncompromising then it is only because the evidence makes it so.
A glance at the dock will show that despite quarrels among themselves each defendant played a part that fitted in with every other and all advanced a common plan.
It was these men among millions of others, and it was these men leading millions of others, who built up Adolf Hitler.
They intoxicated him. He, of the psychopathic personality with power and adulation.
They fed his hates, aroused his fears.
They put a loaded gun in his eager hands. It was left to Hitler to pull the trigger. When he did, they all at that time, applauded.
Hitler's guilt stands admitted by some defendants reluctantly by some, vindictively.
But Hitler's guilt is the guilt of the whole dock and of every man in it.
These defendants now ask this tribunal to say they are not guilty of planning, executing, or conspiring to commit this long list of crimes and wrongs.
They stand before the record of this Tribunal as bloodstained Gloucester stood by the body of his slain king.
He begged the widow, as they beg of you:
"Say I slew them not."
And the Queen replied, "Then say they are not slain.
"But dead they are."
If you were to say of these men that they are not guilty it would be as true to say that there has been no war.
There are no slain.
There has been no crime.
"Jews escalate fight for homeland." lt's ironic.
After all that's happened over the past 10 years I don't blame the Jews for wanting a homeland.
One of the many ripples we'll see from this war and from this trial.
- Shall we?
The defendants may now make their final statements.
Defendant Hermann Goring.
This has been a poor excuse for a trial.
But firstly, I must reiterate my lack of knowledge for these terrible mass murders, which I cannot begin to understand and furthermore, I condemn wholeheartedly.
As to the trial, the statements of the defendants were accepted as true only when they supported the prosecution.
They were treated as perjury when they refuted the indictment.
This is not a basis of proof.
Why am I in the dock being treated as a common criminal?
I say to my judges, have no illusions.
Since the three greatest powers on earth, together with other nations fought us we finally were conquered by tremendous enemy superiority.
Justice has absolutely nothing to do with this trial.
Defendant Albert Speer.
How could so advanced, so cultured so sophisticated a nation as Germany have fallen under Hitler's demonic sway?
The explanation is modern communications.
No longer does a leader have to delegate authority afar to subordinates exercising independent judgment.
Given modern communications, a Hitler can rule directly and personally.
Thus, the more technical the world becomes the more individual freedom and the self-rule of mankind becomes essential.
This war has ended on the note of radio-controlled rockets. Aircraft approaching the speed of sound.
Submarines and torpedoes which can find their own targets. Atom bombs and the horrible prospect of chemical warfare.
In five to ten years, this kind of warfare will offer the possibility of firing rockets from continent to continent with uncanny precision.
Through the smashing of the atom it will be possible to kill 1 million people in New York City in a matter of seconds with a rocket serviced by perhaps ten men.
A new large-scale war will end with the destruction of human culture and civilization.
That is why this trial must contribute to the prevention of such wars in the future.
A nation believing in its future will never perish.
May God protect Germany and the culture of the West.
We are agreed.
Three of four votes will be required for the finding of guilty.
- Agreed. Now, if the judgment is death, might we not consider the firing squad for the military defendants?
I disagree most strongly.
The bullet is for the honorable adversary, not for butchers.
I say hanging.
- l agree.
- l agree.
We will take the defendants in the order they were indicted.
Go on, have some of the lovely food.
There is talk that you will all be hanged.
I won't be hanged.
That I assure you.
That I pledge.
Perhaps the court will send you to an island, like Elba.
We could join you there.
Go on, eat.
Do you think that we would be allowed to take some of the food home with us?
I don't see why not.
The Charter clearly states that following orders "may be considered in mitigation of punishment."
"May be," not must be.
You have become such beautiful young ladies.
When are they going to shoot you, Papa?
Hans Frank is a most tragic figure in my view.
His penitence is obviously real.
It would be a meaningful gesture for us to spare his life.
No. He should hang.
All rise.
Each defendant will stand as his name is called to hear the judgments on the four counts applicable to him and the sentence, if found guilty on any of the counts.
The counts, numbered one through four, are:
Conspiracy to commit aggression.
The commission of aggression.
Crimes in the conduct of warfare and crimes against humanity.
Defendant Hermann Goring.

The Tribunal sentences you to death by hanging.
Defendant Hans Frank.
The Tribunal finds you guilty on counts three and four and sentences you to death by hanging.
Julius Streicher.
Guilty on count four, crimes against humanity.

Quiet, please.
The Defendant Karl Donitz.
Guilty on counts two and three.
The Tribunal sentences you to ten years imprisonment.
Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop.
Guilty on all four counts.
The Tribunal sentences you to death by hanging.

Defendant Albert Speer.
The Tribunal finds you not guilty on counts one and two. But you have been found guilty on counts three and four.
Albert Speer, the Court sentences you to 20 years imprisonment.
The work of this Tribunal is now complete.
Leutnant, my dear Tex, why this long face?
Have I not told you there's a special place in Valhalla waiting for me?
I don't know.
I thought things might have turned out differently.
Well, you know, they might have done, if it wasn't a very unfortunate thing.
Those mass murders.
I must tell you, I could not see their purpose.
They were absolutely unnecessary.
They made no sense from a nationalistic point of view.
Our legacy has been forever tainted.
But make no mistake. Everything Hitler did before the war was right. The German people knew it.
One day, they'll remember it. And you must remember it too, my dear Tex.
When you remember me, remember that.
Now, to practical matters.
- There are a few things I want to give you.
Please.
Where I'm going, I must travel light.
It's inscribed, see, with my name.
The few valuables I have, they are in my blue briefcase in the baggage room.
Can you retrieve that for me, my dear Tex?
Where are they building those gallows?
Down in the back. Third building on the right.
I have only one question to ask you.
is there absolutely no possibility that I may be allowed to face a firing squad and die a soldier's death?
None.
Just as well. I hear the Americans are very poor shots.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must write a letter.
For the rest of my life, Herr Reichsmarschall people will ask me what your final thoughts were.
I'll have nothing to tell them.
You can tell them this:
I say, for now and all time: The foreigners who have imposed this sentence upon me may murder me but they have no right to judge me.
That I deny them.
Now, you must excuse me, I do have to write this letter. Thank you.
My one and only sweetheart.
My life came to an end when I bade you farewell for the last time.
Do not grieve, my dearest one.
Since then I have felt at peace with myself, and consider my death a deliverance.
All my thoughts are with you and our own dear, sweet child. My last heartbeats, of our great and eternal love.
Colonel, may I?
- You got what you want?
- l got it, sir.
Gentlemen, follow me.
Get dressed.
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!
Cyanide.
Son of a bitch.
- State your name.
- Joachim von Ribbentrop.
Do you have anything to say?
My last wish is that Germany realize its destiny. I wish peace to the world.
- Do you have anything to say?
- l now join my sons.
Three.
I'm dying an innocent man.
I ask God to accept me with my sin.
Seven.
All cleaned out. Everything.
The cells are to be scrubbed clean.
Nothing's to be left.
Nothing.
You know, when we get home, we've got some decisions to make.
Some personal decisions.
