Hello, Cole.
I let myself in.
We're not late, are we?
I hate to be late.
No, we're fine.
That sounded lovely.
I hate funeral music.
Though, under the circumstances, I suppose I should say my prayers.
Why start now?
Exactly.
If I believed in God, he would be a song-and-dance man.
He would have to carry a tune.
Preferably one of mine.
Do you think he would like this?
In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you
You wrote that about Linda, of course.
Did I?
Songs don't have to be about someone, you know.
We should start.
I thought we had.
Cole, you have to play us into it.
It's your life.
Your music will be our guide.
Swell.
In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
Oh, my God, that's me!
I'm so young.
You satisfied?
He's very good.
He's not much of a singer.
You never were.
In the still of the night
The words, I can't hear the words.
While the world is in slumber
What's the matter, can't he take direction?
Cole, talk to me, I'll pass your thoughts along.
He can't hear you.
In a musical, everyone works for the composer.
Times have changed.
May I borrow this?
Times have changed
Never open with a ballad.
This isn't one of those avant-garde things, is it?
It's got to be entertaining, it's a musical.
And a love story, of course.
A little unconventional, but honest.
You're playing with my life.
It's my show.
Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them
In olden days lt's your life, Cole.
Was looked on something shocking
Oh, my God.
It's an opening number, of course.
It's the Berlins.
Irving, Ellin.
Irving gave me my start.
This is my whole life.
There's Monty Woolley from Yale.
Look at Monty.
That costume is all wrong.
He never wore that.
That's all wrong.
Change it.
And black's white today And day's night today
L. B. Mayer and the gang from MGM.
The Hollywood years.
When folks who still can ride in jitneys found out that Vanderbilts and Whitneys lack baby clothes
Anything goes
Boris and Jack.
Bill Wrather.
Gerald, Sara, Honoria, where are the boys?
Boys.
Anything goes
Hi, Mom.
And every night, the set that's smart is intruding on nudist parties in studios
Anything goes
Fantastic.
So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer when I propose
Anything goes
If saying your prayers you like, if green pears you like
If old chairs you like, if backstairs you like, If love affairs you like
Stop, this is wrong for Linda.
She should sing a different part, stop.
is it me?
No, dear.
It's backstairs and love affairs.
It's too early for complications.
We're gonna get ready for Paris.
If you're not in Paris, I'll see you later.
Come on, move along.
You're doing beautifully.
But then, you always do.
Remember, it's your story, too.
It's a love story.
-That's why I'm frightened.
-Don't be.
Have you ever seen a musical without a happy ending?
All right, then.
We've just heard Anything Goes... as if it's Cole's declaration of independence.
Independence from whom?
Never mind.
Don't argue with the director, love.
Leave that to me.
He's very strict.
She can't hear you.
I know.
You're seeing Cole for the first time.
You start to move towards him... because there's a spirit in his eye.
Go ahead.
Move slowly.
You'll be fine.
Weren't we fools to lose each other?
Weren't we fools to say goodbye?
God, she was beautiful.
She could stop your heart.
No, start it.
You chose another
So did I
If we'd realized our love was worth defending
Then the story's broken threads we might be mending They're so good, it's a shame more people aren't paying attention.
Cole can take care of that.
Which one is Cole Porter?
The one who's standing, who's being so serious about being playful... that's my husband Gerald.
And the one who's playing at not being serious at all, that's Cole Porter.
-Has somebody died?
-l think it was us, Cole.
-Linda Lee.
-Sara Murphy.
-We met at Lady Mendel's.
-Yes, indeed.
is that Linda Lee Thomas with Sara?
-l really couldn't say.
-No, it is, and just as they described her: The most beautiful divorcée in Paris.
My God, she's ravishing.
is this gonna be another Porter fascination?
An obsession without preliminaries?
Obsessions don't have preliminaries.
-Will you join me?
-l'm a married man.
No, come on grab a chair.
Let's really light a fire under these deadbeats.
You begin.
I have heard, among this clan
You are called "the forgotten man"
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is
Have you heard that Mimsie Starr just got pinched in the Astor Bar?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is
Take over.
-You're not gonna pinch her in the ass?
-l might.
Reggie's rather scatterbrained
He dove in when the pool was drained
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is
It's great, it's grand
It's wonderland
It's tops, it's first
It's DuPont, it's Hearst
What clothes, quel chic
What pearls, they're the peak
What glamor, what cheer
This will simply slay you, dear
Have you heard the coast of Maine just got hit by a hurricane?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is
Have you heard that poor dear Blanche
Got run down by an avalanche?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is
What daiquiris
What sherry, please
What burgundy
What great Pommery
What brandy, wow
What whiskey, here's how
What gin and what beer
Will you sober up, my dear?
Have you heard, Professor Munch ate his wife and divorced his lunch?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party this is
Have you heard, it's in the stars
Next July, we collide with Mars?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party a swell party, a swellegant, elegant party this is!
God, we're a hit!
Now we have a party.
-Shall we?
-Yes, let's.
My God.
Grace personified.
Was that me? Did I sweep you off your feet?
Because I hadn't intended to do that for quite a while.
You really are smooth, aren't you, Mr. Porter?
Never till now, Mrs. Thomas.
Your song was absolutely delirious.
Thank you. I'm never sure if they get the joke.
-Especially when it's on them.
-Learn to trust your audience.
I trust it, I just wish I could expand it.
He seems a bit calculating, don't you think?
-Weren't you?
-Not entirely.
I said I was ambitious, but I was anything but an opportunist.
After all, I spent 10 years in Paris... just having fun.
What are we talking here, a love affair?
A business proposition... or a social arrangement?
There was nothing arranged... or negotiated about our relationship.
It was... our own.
What about these gloves?
is it really true... that you only wear them once and then you discard them?
Yes.
To where do you discard them when you're finished?
I send them to a cousin in Louisville.
Not this one, all right?
Let me keep this.
Look at that hand.
You should never cover your hands, they're beautiful.
-They're ungainly.
-No, they're strong.
No one's ever thought of me as strong before.
I think of you as strong and down to earth...
-and solid. I think of you in many ways.
-You're sweet.
Isn't that Diaghilev and his boy from the Ballets Russes?
That's his premier danseur.
-Would you like to meet them?
-Don't know, would I?
Perhaps another time.
Bonjour.
He is an acquaintance from yesterday.
An unmanned piano.
Come on.
I know you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
Not you, dear.
But grant me, just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For you'd be so easy to love
Christ, that cue is as loud as my whistle.
And it's too early for another song.
If you can say it better than you write it, fine.
Otherwise, Cole sings.
All right.
The yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire
Thank you.
Burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it does seem a shame
If you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love
Dear Cole.
You have so much nerve, Mr. Porter.
God, I'd be frightened.
I'm just showing off.
There are much worse things to be afraid of.
You have a dazzling gift and a life to go with it.
What could you possibly be afraid of?
Myself.
I'm not afraid of that.
I hope you never will be.
Even when you really get to know me.
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it does seem a shame
If you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy
to love
I thought you would be tired of your apartment.
You're gonna have to help me out here.
I mean, if this is really you.
Why?
This is how it was.
This is how I was.
I wanted every kind of love that was available.
I could never find them in the same person.
Or the same sex.
I've never had the urge to be completely honest with anyone until you.
It's quite disturbing.
Especially since I haven't been totally honest.
You knew so much about me when we met, Cole... don't you think I'd heard a thing or two about you?
Then you know about....
Well, that I can be....
That I have... other interests.
Interests, the pursuit of which some people might find cruel to you.
You mean men?
Yes, men.
Let's just say you like them more than I do.
Nothing is cruel that fulfills your promise.
I've been promising all my life.
I've got a notebook full of promise.
Trunks full.
I want to be more than promising to you.
We could fulfill your promise together.
We could be singular as a couple.
Would you stay for dinner?
It will be just us.
I'd like that.
So, did you love her then?
Then?
I don't know.
I thought I might discover what love was.
The physical side was always....
We could take it or leave it.
It was pleasant enough.
But the intimacy was stunning.
Good morning.
What's that?
It's an idea for a song.
This part, right here, I think would go nicely with...
"l love you."
What do you think?
I think that would be beautiful.
I do, you know.
You don't have to love me the way that I love you, Cole.
Just love me.
It's so easy.
This verse you've started seems to me
The Tin Pan-tithesis of melody
So to spare you all the pain
Monty.
I almost didn't recognize you under all that hair.
We've all matured since school, Coley.
At Yale, the only grooms that interested you were in the stables.
Monty, behave yourself.
This is the happiest day of my life.
The night is young, the skies are clear
So if you wanna go walking, dear
Along with the bluebird, dogwood is the great harbinger of the Kentucky spring.
-They're beautiful.
-Thank you.
I'm ready.
Ma'am.
Where is he?
You might prefer privacy.
I would not.
To holy matrimony, then.
And whatever further perforations you may put in it.
-Excuse me.
-What?
Sorry, Monty.
It's good to see you again, Mrs. Thomas.
-lt's Mrs. Porter.
-Not yet.
Don't blame poor Cody... he was only doing what I told him.
My name never suited?
Thomas not proper enough?
It's another name for "shame."
So now you're all snug and proper, are you?
Marrying this fawn?
Why are you here, Edward?
There's a certain section of the bar here.
The left side, I think, significantly enough... where your groom and his gentleman friends like to call on each other.
I assumed, for symbolic purposes at least... that the wedding would be held there.
I had to assume, you see... since my invitation never arrived.
-l would invite you to hell.
-No need.
Already there.
Too bad you never cared for it.
In spite of caring for you once--
My fault, then.
You offered care, I needed passion.
What does the fawn need?
Can you supply him?
Surely not with everything.
And what can he give you?
Pride.
Don't turn your back on me, Mrs. Thomas.
That's so funny.
From what I remember, it was the position you most favored.
-Are you all right?
-l'm fine.
Wait.
Mr. Thomas, you have the most peculiar sense of timing.
You think you can make her happy because you won't violate her delicacy?
Because you don't need her as a woman?
I think maybe we define "woman" differently.
I don't define it as "punching bag," for instance.
Cole's not like you.
He creates, you destroy.
And as you can see, you're a failure even at that.
Let's get married.
See the crowd in that church
See the proud parson plopped on his perch
Get the sweet beat of that organ sealing our doom
Here goes the groom, boom!
How they cheer and how they smile
As we go galloping down the aisle
It's divine, dear, it's diveen, dear
It's de-wunderbar, it's de-victory
It's de-vallop, it's de-vinner It's de-voiks
-Mrs. Murphy?
-Absolutely.
The knot is tied and so we take
A few hours off to eat wedding cake
It's delightful, it's delicious
It's de-lovely
It feels so fine
-Thank you, dearest.
-For what?
For all of this, for our future.
For being with me just now with Edward.
That was nothing.
That was pest control, that's all.
To the pop of champagne
Off we hop in our plush little plane
Till a bright light through the darkness They seem so happy.
Let's hope he doesn't misbehave.
Our day's complete And what a beautiful bridal suite
It's dreamy, it's drowsy
It's de-reverie, it's de-rhapsody
It's de-regal, it's de-royal
It's de-Ritz, it's de-lovely
We settle down as man and wife
To solve the riddle called married life
It's delightful
It's delicious
Now you love her, yes?
I said the words.
I meant them.
I wanted to mean them.
God knows I wrote them often enough.
And even more after we were married.
Maybe that says something.
They did always sound better with music under them.
God, she was beautiful.
Venice.
We had such parties.
We had a floating dance floor on the Grand Canal.
You know that Robert Browning once lived in that palazzo?
He got a lot more written than I did, but he didn't have half the fun.
There they are.
Hello, Berlins.
Welcome to Palazzo Rezzonico.
I got so out of hand that finally Linda had to bring in reinforcements.
And being Linda, she brought the best.
She single-handedly orchestrated my reformation.
I have to say, the music is not bad, either.
-ls that Cole?
-Yes, it is.
This funny thing called love
Just who can solve its mystery?
Cole?
You're Irving Berlin.
-Am I interrupting?
-No, I mean, yes.
But it's an honor to be interrupted by America's greatest songwriter.
-What a pleasure.
-The most publicized, that's for sure.
And rightfully so.
Linda has told us so much about you, she's left out the most important stuff.
-What would that be?
-Your songs.
I heard about them, but I've never actually heard one played before.
You were listening to that?
That's a bit daunting.
I need a drink.
Can I offer you something?
No, it's okay.
I'm gonna let you get back to your work.
I'd love to hear the tune when it's done.
It's a real pleasure.
A real pleasure.
-Pleasure's mine, welcome to Venice.
-Thank you very much.
-We'll have some fun later.
-l look forward to that, Cole.
I was a humdrum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my humdrum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again
What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in heaven above
What is this thing called love?
What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in heaven above
What is this thing called love?
Bravo, Cole.
You know, Cole, you're spoiling us.
And, excuse me, you're pampering yourself.
You have far too much talent to waste as an amateur.
And we must do something about that.
I think it may be the most beautiful love song you've written yet.
Why, thank you.
There's quite a bit of you in it.
What do you think you'll call it?
I don't know, something about confusion.
Dinner is served.
Yes, let's eat.
Thank you for your indulgence.
That was the truth, for the most part.
There was a lot of Linda in that song.
I wish there could have been more.
We are leaving soon, you know.
The tour begins.
I heard.
I don't like it one bit.
I don't know what I'm going to do without you.
Of course, you know... it is only a European tour... and I can travel.
I could mysteriously appear in certain European cities from time to time.
But you are a married man.
What about Mrs. Porter?
Boris, I've told you... Mrs. Porter... tries very hard to want what I want.
Surely not everything.
Whatever I need.
As long as she knows the rest belongs to her.
And what is the rest?
Everything that happens in the daylight.
Which is why I have to go.
-l'll see you there?
-Of course.
You could have a great career
And you should, yes, you should
Only one thing stops you, dear
You're too good, way too good
If you want a future, darling, why don't you get a past?
'Cause that fatal moment's coming at last
We're all alone, no chaperone
Can get our number
The world's in slumber
Let's misbehave
There's something wild about you, child It's so contagious
Let's be outrageous
Let's misbehave
When Adam won Eve's hand
He wouldn't stand for teasing
He didn't care about those apples out of season
They say that spring means just one thing
To little lovebirds
We're not above birds, let's misbehave
I'm being hailed.
It's from Irving.
Irving?
-You knew.
-l had hoped.
No, you knew.
Okay, I didn't know what the show was to be called.
It's to be called Paris.
And Irving has assured the producer... that I'm the only one with the suitable sophistication... to do the show.
So it seems that we would be leaving Venice... to go to New York to do a show called Paris.
We'll go, won't we?
Darling, what do you think?
I know you would like to.
You orchestrated the whole thing, you willed it into being.
I'm just not sure I'm ready.
Cole, I promise you, you are ready.
Irving Berlin believes in your talent.
He wouldn't recommend you simply out of friendship.
No, I suppose not.
Cole, it will be a wonderful chance for you, and a good change for us.
Yes.
Yes, we'll go?
Yes, it will be a big change.
I think we need a change.
I never intended this to cause a breach between us.
It hasn't, it just....
Cole, we never had a formal agreement, we don't need one now.
It's done.
I can't promise you that.
Just so it doesn't put us in jeopardy.
Or your music.
You really love me that much?
You are the rhythm of my heart.
They're playing your song.
Would you care to dance?
Why not?
They say that bears have love affairs
And even camels
We're merely mammals, let's misbehave
See, true love.
I'm not so sure about true.
Linda played that beautifully.
I think that's when I began to really love her.
All right, Linda, Cole, smile if you're in love, please.
Didn't that make things even more complicated?
-What things?
-Your other relationships.
No, why should it?
Isn't that why birds do it, bees do it?
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Welcome, sir.
Folks in Siam do it
Think of Siamese twins
Say hello to Mrs. Porter.
Richard, would you please take my hat?
People say in Boston, even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Cold Cape Cod clams against their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks them, I know
Why ask if shad do it?
Waiter, bring me shad roe
In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
The dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it
So does every katydid do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
The most refined ladybugs do it
When a gentlemen calls
Moths in your rugs do it
What's the use of mothballs?
Locusts in trees do it
Bees do it
Even overeducated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Very cheeky.
Excellent.
-That's so far.
-Listen to them.
One act down, one to go.
Darling, for you.
God, Linda.
Exquisite.
Just a little memory.
There are no little memories with you.
Patrick, you all right?
is he all right doing that?
His doctors approve?
Probably not, but he's got to have a childhood.
His sickness seems to come and go.
Patrick, let me give you the key to the cartwheel.
It's all mental.
Keep your arms straight.
Here comes trouble.
You plant it, watch this, ready?
And plant it like that.
See?
Good catch.
I always thought so.
Sun-tanned, wind-blown
Honeymooners at last alone
-You know, this was written as a duet.
-Thanks.
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on it will always be
True love, true love
Cole, I know this is your song, but it just doesn't sound like you.
Linda thinks it does.
With nothing to do
Are you going to put it in the new show you're working on?
-Why not?
-Because it doesn't sound like me.
Love forever true
Bravo!
Oh, my goodness, could you be any more wonderful?
Come in.
-Hello.
-Hi.
I was lying in my bed just now, thinking... I don't want to stay in that room. I want to stay here tonight, is that all right?
Of course it is, darling.
is everything all right?
Are you lonely?
No, I'm fine.
It's just that.... lt's funny, this afternoon... I was watching you... and watching you watching the Murphys' kids... and I thought about how happy we are and how much we have... and then I thought about the Murphys and how happy they are... and I think we could be....
We are as happy as the Murphys, but we could be happy in the way that... the Murphys are happy if we had what the Murphys have.
They bring them so much happiness.
I'm so glad I'm not trying to write this as a song.
It would be a beautiful serenade.
Champagne, or how do you wanna play this?
Comedy, tragedy?
Musical comedy, farce?
Why don't we just play?
Good idea.
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think--
Stop!
-lt's impossible, I just can't do it.
-Cole.
He is only an actor, but he's still maybe right.
He's tried it seven times.
The song is a problem.
I told you, we should have given it to Astaire.
Beard, the song is not a problem, it's a challenge.
Just give me a moment.
Jack, dear boy... what can I do to help?
Write another song.
God, that cuts me right to the quick.
I know it's God-awful, but it's the best I can do.
And we open in three days.
Look, Mr. Porter, the song goes so high and so low, it is impossible.
It's not impossible.
Jack, I wrote it with you in mind.
I know you've got it. I can sing it, and I have a range of three notes.
Where did you come up with it?
I get all my ideas from a little Chinese man in Poughkeepsie.
Listen, you can sing this.
The problem is, you're not having any fun.
Just don't think about the melody.
Just think about the words.
It's about obsession.
It's about being in love.
You've been in love?
All right, obsess about it.
Just sing it with me.
Think about the lyrics and just look at me.
One more time.
Jimmy?
Like the beat beat beat of the tom tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
-As it stands against the wall -lt's relentless, it's obsessive.
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating You you you
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
That's beautiful.
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Jimmy, try E flat.
Day and night
Why is it so That this longing for you Follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day
Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
Bravo.
I never believed in anything, least of all myself, until Linda.
She restored me to myself.
And I gave her back... me.
Hardly payment in kind.
Irving swears that The Times critic was dancing up the aisle.
Our producer was still standing in the front row, applauding.
No triumph complete without this.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Let's not be late.
I'm gonna ride with Monty if it's all right with you.
He says the London producers are dying to talk to me... about the West End transfer.
is it all right if I join you later?
Can't you speak with him at the party?
No business at the party, only fun.
-lt's all right, I'll be there soon.
-All right.
Bye-bye.
Beard, you know, you're very dear to me, always have been... but these opening night gifts of yours are becoming more and more intricate.
It's not as elegant as one of Linda's cigarette cases, I know... but I believe it may be better suited to the daring side of your nature.
Monty, you've always been so solicitous vis-à-vis my nature.
You pamper me.
I have to, my boy.
Nature is a nasty bitch.
If nature were fair, I'd be Marlene Dietrich.
If you wake up and dream
Life will suddenly seem as gay as it used to be
Never mind what they say Let your dreams dream away
And you'll still be alive when they're dead
Your words.
Yes, Monty, but it's a song, not a call to arms.
Arms weren't what I had in mind.
I wanted to tell you privately how much all your attention did for me.
And Night and Day, how much it means to me.
From here on, you two will have to improvise.
I'm gonna find some trouble of my own in the Ramble.
Shall we have a cigarette?
Good morning.
This is something new.
To be inconsiderate, to ignore your obligations.
I know.
I'm so sorry, I really am.
That was unforgivable.
Cole, you disappointed a lot of people last night.
The London producers were there.
Some Hollywood people were most anxious to speak with you.
I don't want to go to Hollywood, and I don't want to fight.
I don't want to fight.
-And I don't want to blame.
-Thank you for that, dear.
But if things are gonna be different... I'd like to know.
I'll tell you as soon as I know.
You must have known already.
I got the ending.
I didn't know how much my happiness would hurt us.
We couldn't hear the songs the same way anymore.
Suddenly the lyrics all sounded like code.
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes
Good authors, too, who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes
If saying your prayers you like They love your song.
-If green pears you like -If green pears you like
-If old chairs you like -If old chairs you like
Don't you?
If backstairs you like
-If love affairs you like -If love affairs you like
If love affairs you like
With young bears you like
Why, nobody will oppose
So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that I'm bound to answer
When you propose
Anything goes
Ellin says Irving is having a great run in Hollywood.
The Gershwins are there--
You want me to leave at the top of my game?
-If old hymns you like -If old hymns you like
-If bare limbs you like -If bare limbs you like
-If Mae West you like -If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like I'll give this to you now in case...
Monty has more producers for you to visit.
The set that's smart is intruding on nudist parties in studios
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
-By the way, do you want one?
-No, thank you.
-That's beautiful.
From Linda?
-Yeah, of course, opening night.
Linda must be keeping Cartier in business all by herself.
-She does spoil me. I don't deserve it.
-No, you probably don't.
Which reminds me, how's Linda?
She's all right.
A bit more fragile than usual, but all right.
How's Patrick?
There's a doctor in Zurich who may give us more time.
They don't give you much hope with tuberculosis.
So sorry.
Does Linda know?
She hasn't said anything.
Yeah.
She said, "We live in castles built on sand."
I just think that life has been one great carnival... and now we're teetering on the high wire.
Yes, but you've got Sara to catch you, and I have Linda.
Ever wonder who's there to catch them?
When they begin
The beguine
It brings back the sound
Of music so tender
It brings back a night
Of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory evergreen
I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are
Swearing to love forever
Promising never
Never to part
What moments divine
What rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire
I only remember
When they begin the beguine
When they begin
the beguine
I am so terribly sorry, darling.
I know how late I must be.
Late?
-Linda, you missed the whole thing.
-l misplaced the cigarette case.
I'd rather have had you.
It would have been bad luck.
To hell with luck.
This feels very wrong.
I don't like bringing up this whole thing.
It happened and it was over, and that was that.
We never brought it up again.
Finished, done.
Done, maybe.
Finished?
-l won't have it.
-lt's not your choice.
Anyway, I hope you like it.
Linda, what were you thinking?
You wouldn't have lost it.
I had hoped not.
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing!
Absolutely nothing.
Definitively nothing.
Shall we go now?
I would hate to compound the felony by making us late for the party.
That would be terrible, dreadful.
A tragedy too great to bear.
God, Linda, what's happened?
Nothing, just a small thing. lt's just not like being late or missing an opening.
A very small thing... that stopped growing.
My sweet girl, I'm so sorry.
I didn't want to tell you like this.
I just went to the doctor, he said I should rest, and it got so late.
I'm sorry.
I wanted it so, Cole.
I wanted it for us.
I know.
-l want to take you home now.
All right?
-l don't want to go home.
I don't even feel like we have a home.
Then we'll find a new one.
We'll get out of town, we'll travel.
We'll find a new place.
Some place good for you and good for me.
If everyone's moved to Hollywood, then we'll go there, too.
We'll try it.
We'll make a fresh start.
Let's just get the doctor in tonight, just to make sure you're all right.
No more doctors.
I already know I'm not all right.
Linda, then it wasn't meant to be, that's all.
So, fine, we'll be all right.
We'll be just fine with what was meant to be.
That's you and that's me.
That's what was meant to be.
I love you, Linda Porter.
I love you so much.
-Okay, darling, don't cheat.
-lt's not in my nature to cheat.
All right, okay.
-All right. Ready?
-l'm ready.
My goodness.
is it all right?
No, I'd like something a little bigger, please.
It's Hollywood, darling, we do things big out here.
This is beautiful.
Look at the bow.
Richard!
Let me show you the inside.
All of Metro is proud to have you as part of our family, Cole.
You said that, L.B. Thank you, I appreciate it.
I wanted to tell you again, just to be sure you know.
-We know you'll be happy here.
-l'm already happy.
Swell.
That makes me happy, you're happy.
You know who else makes me happy?
Irving Berlin.
Every song Irving Berlin writes, I love.
You know why?
Because his songs sound like what people who aren't clever... say to each other when they're in love.
Real love songs.
Not clever love songs.
Could you write real love songs?
When you write funny songs, I want funny-funny, not clever-funny.
Could you do that for me?
You're stronger if you're not angry.
Tickle their ribs as you slide in the knife.
Try it.
I'll remember forever when I was but three
Mama, who was clever, remarking to me
If, son, when you're grown up you want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up if you take this advice
Be a clown
Be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh
Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
And if you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
-Be a clown -Be a clown
-All the world
-Loves a clown
-Show 'em tricks
-Tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks
Be a crack jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears?
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds will pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears?
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make them roar
Watch your mountebank account soar
Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
-Give 'em quips -Give 'em quips
-Give 'em fun -Give 'em fun
And they'll pay to say you're A-one
If you become a farmer, you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler, you'll be stuck with your luck
But, Jack, you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
Be a clown
Be a clown
Be a clown
Jesus, though, it was a relief just to have fun and... do something trite and not care a damn... and get paid a hundred times what you'd be paid for something good.
I love you under my skin They'll never know the difference.
What's it going to be called?
What's the dreariest title ever?
I bet Coley $5... that he could never write a song called I Love You.
Get your money out. i'm telling you, Louis B. Mayer is going to love this.
He's going to weep.
I need a time of year.
A month.
-All right, April.
-June.
Perfect cliché, April.
"I love you" hums the April breeze
I love you under my skin
I love you
Is it a sin?
Certainly not.
"I love you"
hums the April breeze
"I love you"
Echo the hills
"I love you"
The golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees daffodils
It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody
"I love you"
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs to you and me
It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings lt's a real pearl.
Go ahead, dear, take it.
It's tiny, but trust me, it's still the biggest thing... you can get your fingers around in this crowd.
-You'll make big bucks on this.
-That's swell.
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it's lovely.
It's so imaginative to actually have the party at the studio.
is absolutely everything in Hollywood connected to movies?
Everything good.
That's why we're trying to coax Cole into permanent residency.
How would half of every year be?
I think Hollywood's fantastic, it's like living on the moon.
Or 20,000 leagues under the sea.
When we started painting the town
Can you believe this?
Linda, Hollywood was your idea, not mine.
Now you're acting like it's the worst place on earth.
I had thought that the change of weather might be good for us both.
I had no idea how hot the climate would really be.
The climate is good for growing flowers.
Everything grows wild, Cole.
And the pickings are far too easy.
Now and then It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
-Mr. Porter, how are you? -Mr.
Nelson.
What you did with that song is just splendid.
I'd love to introduce you to my wife.
Cole... I hope we could coax you into a song.
Be right back.
-Good song.
-Thank you.
There's a plan for later.
Linda's being very prickly tonight, but I'll try to get away.
-Plenty of company lined up?
-Good company, I promise.
Thank you all.
This is indeed an honor and a surprise.
Obviously L.B. wants you all to get home early... that's why he's asked me to sing.
So here goes.
Before you leave these portals
To meet less fortunate mortals
There's just one final message I would give to you
Now you all have learned reliance
On the sacred teachings of science
So I hope through life you never will decline
In spite of philistine defiance
To do what all good scientists do
Experiment
Make it your motto day and night
Experiment
It will lead you to the light
If this advice you'll only employ
The future can offer you infinite joy
And merriment
Experiment
And you'll see
Good night.
Thank you.
What a marvelous song.
I don't know it, do you?
intimately.
You seem very happy, dear.
I am, darling. I wish you were.
-Excuse me.
-The Springs will take care of that.
I was actually thinking of going to Arizona.
It's so much further.
I don't mind.
I expect I'll be gone by the time you come home.
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
Love for sale
Who
will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Every love but true love
Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Aren't there always copies of those sorts of photographs anyway?
Cole wanted a set for himself.
These are not blackmail pictures, Linda, they're--
Mrs. Porter.
They were taken for recreational purposes.
Cole has a heedless appetite for life.
I'm sure we agree he needs to be protected.
You became devoted so very quickly, Mr. Reed.
He is so easy to love.
Beyond devotion, what are your ambitions?
I have thought of my own theatrical agency.
It would be a company that would... keep their clients' best interests close to heart, always.
As you and I do Cole's.
Of course.
And how many backers do you require?
Only one, Mrs. Porter.
Just let me know how much.
I'll leave these with you.
You don't sweat, do you?
Not a drop.
I don't believe in wasting my resources.
Goodbye, Linda.
It's the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
But it's all right with me
Welcome home.
Aren't you pleased?
-About the roses?
-Yes.
They're glorious.
Are they for me?
Who else?
One never knows.
What's wrong, Linda?
Your friend Bobby Reed has been to see me... with his nefarious portfolio.
Yes, he told me.
-He told you?
-Yes.
I paid him, too, you know.
No, I didn't know.
Yes, he's an ambitious fellow.
It's all right.
I don't think it's all right, Cole.
I think it's disgusting.
He's exploiting both of us.
Well, yes.
I like to look at it as a kind of luxury tax.
A luxury tax?
What an extraordinary thing to say.
Do you have any idea how much you've changed?
How much your behavior has changed?
You have put everything that you've accomplished with your music at risk.
Darling, my work has never been better.
It's flourishing.
Even if we're not.
Your music comes from your talent, not from your behavior.
It's all the same thing. I can't put my talent here and my behavior here... and my eating, sleeping, and drinking habits.
It's all me.
I have never asked you to change.
Just be discreet.
Linda, I have never been discreet.
What is discretion but dishonesty wrapped up in a little good breeding?
I don't think you want me to be discreet, I think you want me to be different.
I am partially responsible for all of this... because I have spoiled you, I have indulged you.
But so has the entire goddamned world.
And for what?
Just a little music.
Linda hated being late for anything.
And the next day she was late for lunch.
I only had to hear the clock strike... and look at her empty place at the table to know she was gone.
Gone back to Paris.
It's quite simple, really.
Two people who wanted too much from each other.
Porter residence.
Hold one moment.
-Sir.
-Not now.
It's urgent, sir.
Yes?
All the money, all the music had deflected reality for so long... I didn't know that everything we had was so fragile.
Hold it loose, hold it tight.
Everything breaks.
I'm going to take them to Paris next week.
All of this is just....
Got to get back to a better place.
And it would be good to see Linda.
Morning, Cole.
Are we the only ones up?
Our hostess just retired.
I've been up since 5:00.
Writing another hit, I'm sure.
I wish it was that easy.
Nothing comes easy anymore.
And when it does, it's lousy.
I write better in my own place or the Murphys'.
I'm going to swear off these house parties until I finish this score.
Remind me I said that, will you?
That melody sounds like it could go somewhere.
Yeah, like out for a drink.
Have you heard from Linda?
No.
No. I've written, I've wired, I've called.
Nothing.
I'm sorry, Cole, I'm really sorry.
Maybe with time.... lt'll take more than time.
I'll be back before breakfast.
Just seemed so much to ask children to bear.
How long will you stay?
No idea.
Let's go inside, it's getting cold.
You see how far I'll go to get you back?
I think you've gone too far this time... but I ought to be used to it by now.
I'm afraid his right leg should be amputated.
Perhaps the left as well.
There's really no alternative.
If you amputate his legs, you will cut out his pride.
You'll break his spirit, he would never work again.
He'll have nothing without his music, it's the essence of him.
He'd have nothing to live for.
He would have his life, his friends, you.
Nothing.
He would just be living out his death.
You're asking a lot of him.
We are accustomed to asking a lot of one another.
So what did the sawbones say?
You get to keep the old things.
And he expects you to walk, and so do I.
But only if I can walk to you.
As far as Williamstown?
Williamstown?
Massachusetts. I found a very pretty home.
It's on a hill, it has a work space.
Thinking of buying it.
A little bump.
-All right.
-Now?
A grand piano.
That is grand.
That's not quite right.
So shall I leave you to it?
Guess you'd better.
God, I can't work the pedal.
Can't work the pedals, dear.
God damn it!
I can't work the pedals!
And what did it take... to finally work the pedals?
A few years.
A pharmacopoeia of pills.
A reservoir of Scotch and 20 more operations.
Nonstop fun.
But over time, you got five shows up and running.
Up?
Yes. Running?
Barely.
At least, according to the critics.
"Not up to Mr. Porter's usual standards"... was the refrain.
So when Hollywood finally called again?
I was on the train before the second ring.
He is the same.
One of Yale's sons of whom we are all proud.
Cole Porter.
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
If I can survive this movie, I can survive anything.
And you shall, darling, beautifully, like everything else.
Thank you.
The movie will do very well, and you'll be encouraged.
I wonder, it seems like every time they operate, I lose songs as well as blood.
Remind me to call the studio and tell them how much we "absolutely loved the movie."
Naturally.
Sorry. I'm all right.
Why on earth does Linda come back to Cole anyway?
Because he's Cary Grant.
And she misses the music, as do I.
I must say, going down in history as Cary Grant is not too bad.
Not for a boy from Indiana.
We should be grateful to them, they found us a happy ending.
Yes, happy endings.
You don't get many of those, do you, in Hollywood?
So this promises what, surgery number 25?
Twenty-six.
Good God.
And how long will I have to wear the cast this time?
A few months, we'll see how you mend.
What's that?
It's Linda.
It's gotten that bad, then?
Even if she'd agree, I don't think surgery would help.
The lungs are too damaged.
Dr. Moorhead, are you saying that Linda is dying?
God, what a swell party this is.
Four weeks, you rehearse and rehearse
Three weeks, and it couldn't be worse
One week, will it ever be right?
Then out of the hat, it's that big first night
The overture is about to start
You cross your fingers and hold your heart
It's curtain time and off we go
Another opening of another show
Miss Morrison, the line is "away we go," not "off we go," dear.
You couldn't manage to make me hear you before... and now that I can hear you, you've got it wrong.
So shall we do it again?
Let's pick it up, dust it off, and get it right.
The tempo was good.
All right, everyone, let's go.
One week, will it ever be right?
Then out of the hat, it's that big first night
The overture is about to start
You cross your fingers and hold your heart
It's curtain time and away we go
Another opening
Just another opening of another show
Very good.
Thank you, all.
Carry on.
And chorus... keep those consonants crisp.
The audience shouldn't think you're saying, "An annoying opening for an ugly show."
Let them come to that conclusion on their own.
Please stop that knocking.
-Mr. Porter.
-What?
Your wife sent me to fetch you.
Fetch me for what?
-For tea.
-l don't like tea.
It's just a few steps.
She's waiting.
Fine, come in.
Fetch me, for Christ's sake.
-Who are you, anyway?
-Bill, Bill Wrather.
Bill rather?
Rather what?
Bill Wrather.
Yes, you're Linda's...
-decorating wizard.
Yes. -lt's a great pleasure for me, Mr. Porter.
The pleasure is mine.
-Can I?
-No.
-Are you sure?
-No. Lots of practice.
I will take an arm, actually.
Thank you.
Well, I'll be making my way.
Linda, a pleasure as always.
Indeed.
I'll see you soon.
Cole, that tune you were playing was just beautiful.
I can't wait to hear that in the show.
-Goodbye now.
-Safe drive.
-lsn't he delightful?
-Lovely.
We've become such fast friends.
I was hoping that you might as well.
He'd be a good companion for you.
Linda?
I don't want you to be lonely.
I'm worried about you.
You don't need to worry about me or your show, it's all taken care of.
I'm in God's hands, the show is in yours.
I do wish it were the other way round, though.
Give me that cigarette.
Strange, dear
But true, dear
When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
This really needs a proper singer.
I really can't do it justice.
Wait till opening night, hear it sung well.
I think it sounds fine right now.
And I won't be there, dear.
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't you be?
You know the doctors, honey, they're so boring.
I don't think I would add very much to it.
I'm sure it will be a great occasion.
It won't be any occasion if you're not there.
Darling, Bill will be with you.
He'll help you.
I wrote this for you.
What's the point of doing it if you're not gonna be there?
Well, that's why I want you to play it for me.
All the way through.
All right.
I won't do it justice, but I'll do it.
Strange, dear, but true, dear
When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I
Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I
In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
-Wait.
-Are you all right?
A few people may have been carried out of my shows... but no one's ever been carried in.
So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love
Think of Linda a little and applaud a lot.
In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care
So taunt me
And hurt me
Deceive me
Desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you my love, am I
In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care
So taunt me
And hurt me
Deceive me
Desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love
So in love
So in love
my love
am I
Bravo!
Sorry, we have to move on.
Please, let me enjoy this.
It took two years to get the backers interested in this show.
No one wanted anything to do with it, they thought I was finished.
We have to move on.
Very well.
We make quite a pair, don't we?
We're still les colporteurs of Paris.
Plying our humble trade.
I could hear the score.
Darling, it's giddy.
It's all about Paris.
Brings back fond memories.
-Those were fine days. -Yes, they were.
-And we were fine.
-We were fine.
Finding each other.
Taking care of each other.
I have a little something for you.
It's a whole new flower.
A gentleman in Spain did it up for me.
It's a hybrid of two varieties of rose... thought to be completely incompatible.
Yet look at it, it's perfect.
The Linda Porter rose.
Exquisite.
It's just a pale reflection of our life together.
It wasn't all beautiful.
You were always my life to be.
-l remember that song.
-lt was about you.
They were all about you.
Not all of them.
But some, I hope.
How I have loved you, Cole.
I don't know how much longer I can stay.
Would you mind terribly if I went just a little early?
Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me they allow you to go
When you're near there's such an air
of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Every time we say
goodbye
Goodbye
Sara.
Hello, darling.
Gerald.
How is he?
Cole is already seated.
He doesn't want anyone to feel awkward about the leg.
He would still have the damn thing if Linda were here.
And Monty was by for a visit.
He asked to be remembered, of course.
Good old Monty.
Noted.
So, Cole, when are we gonna get another lyric from you?
I haven't the wit nor the will to write any more.
Cole, you can write from everything you remember.
You've had the most fascinating life.
Sara.
Memories.
It's like the phantom pains I get in my missing leg.
They're not real and they hurt too much.
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop.
Cole, please.
Don't.
Oh, my God.
My dear friends, I'm boring you.
Let us repair to the living room for some goodbyes... and some coffee and some traveling music, shall we?
Bill is all packed, and you all have a long drive ahead of you.
The invitation was for the weekend.
Let's pretend it's Sunday.
We'll be right there.
-Sara.
-All right, dear.
I wish you'd let me stay with you, Cole.
I want to stay.
Bill, please, let me at least try to do something noble, all right?
What I'm trying to do is best for both of us.
Then can't both of us decide, not just you?
My sweet boy, there's nothing for you here.
Come on now, get the wheelchair.
It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming it's the wrong face
It's not her face
That was evil. I'm sorry.
I think you're trying very hard to misbehave.
-And you used to be a better actor.
-l used to be better at a lot of things.
At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best Instead of getting them off my chest
To let them rest, unexpressed
You're the top
You're the Coliseum
You're the top
Go on, get out of here.
Get outta town
Cole, by all means--
Before it's too late, my love
Take it easy, old friend.
Get outta town
Be good to me please
Why wish me harm?
Take care of him.
Why not retire to a farm and be contented to charm
the birds off the trees?
We love you.
It's done
The little dream, it's done
So bid me a fond farewell we both had our fun
Cole.
Was it Romeo or Juliet who said when about to die
"Love is not all peaches and cream"
Little dream
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.
Goodbye
Lonely, miserable, melancholy
What a perfect musical finale.
Don't worry.
Never open on a ballad, never end on one either.
-Do you hear that playing?
-Yes, we hear that playing
-Do you know who's playing?
-No, who is that playing?
Well it's Gabriel, Gabriel playing Gabriel, Gabriel saying
"Will you be ready to go when I blow my horn?"
Oh, blow, Gabriel blow
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow
I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp
But now I'm willing to trim my lamp So blow, Gabriel, blow
Oh, I was low, Gabriel, low
Mighty low, Gabriel, low
But now since I have seen the light I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel, blow
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow
I want to join your happy band
And play all day in the Promised Land So blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow Gabriel, blow, blow, blow
I want to join your happy band And play all day in the Promised Land
So blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
In the still of the night
As I gaze from my window
at the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you
In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you
"Do you love me
"as I love you?
"Are you my life to be
"my dream come true?"
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill, in the chill
still of the night?
Like the moon growing dim on the rim
of the hill, in the chill
still of the night?
OK, folks, here they come.
The marvellous Harry Secombe the delightful Spike Milligan... Oh, and Peter Sellers!
This is the BBC Home Service!
It's time for...
Another remarkable 1957 edition of the wireless, talking type... Goon Show!
You sir, with the linen hair and oily suit.
What is it that you want you sick and twisted boy?
I must ask you to empty your pockets.
Ah, quit stalling, man. Empty your pockets.
Now listen to me, Neddie that is our entire worldly wealth.
What, what, what, what, what?
Then what's that ominous bulge in the seat of his trousers?
Oh, just some leather meringues.
Listen to me, my good man, we'd like to hire your stained-glass battering ram.
- Ooh, what for?
- How about two shillings?
- I haven't got two shillings.
- We'll take it anyway.
No!
You dirty, rotten swine!
You broke my little cardboard sword.
A stowaway, I say!
Come on out!
All right, I will come out.
Send in Mr Sellers.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Sellers.
- Now...
Is that you with him?
Am I right in reading that you're here for the part of Ned Brockway?
Yes, that's right.
You do realise the script calls for a 60-year-old war veteran?
I've got his voice worked out.
I could do a bit for you.
Mr Sellers, I know you're quite big on radio...
I don't like to boast.
But film's a different medium.
It's one I'm quite, quite keen on.
- A visual medium, dear.
- Yes, of course.
A very unforgivingly visual medium.
But thank you ever so much for coming.
I am little Michael Bluebottle.
I am an ace private detective.
He's got his own scooter he's got his own make-up.
- He goes anywhere in fiction.
- And I am hotfoot after the criminals what have stolen all the string!
I suspect the Moriarty man.
Ah, where is that Moriarty man?
- Thinks. Points finger.
- Pointy, pointy, pointy.
Oh, God, now we've done it.
- I'll get her, Anne.
- It's all right, I'll go.
No, it's my house, I'll help Peter.
You're tired. You stay and rest. Have some fun.
Leave it to me and Peg.
All right, Dad, you can be Major Dennis Bloodnok.
And you've just apprehended England's biggest string criminal.
- All right.
You're under arrest.
It's all right, it's all right.
Dear, dear me.
That's the girl.
She's lovely.
Thanks, Mum. I'll...
I'll do it.
Those film people won't have anything to do with me, Mum.
It was my fifth audition this week.
- What did they say to you?
- Same as usual.
Not good-looking enough not magnetic enough.
"Stick to radio.
That's what you're good at." Keep being the ringmaster in a circus of twits.
Maybe I should just be content.
You simpering cow.
How can you be content changing nappies in a flat like a woman?
You want to be a failure like your father mewl about contentment.
- That's not very fair.
- I didn't bring you up to be content.
I didn't slog round third-rate music halls doing three shows a night so you could powder your baby's bottom and whine about how nobody ever gives the radio man a chance.
Peter, no one's gonna hand it to you.
You want success you've gotta go out and take it!
Bite the hand that feeds you. There'll always be another hand with more food. And they'll be impressed by the sharpness of your teeth!
- I love you, Peter.
- I love you, Peg.
- I really love you, Peter.
- I love you, too, Peg.
Send in Mr Cobblers.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Would you like to sit down, Mr Cobblers?
I'd prefer to stand, if you don't mind.
You see, I caught a bit of shrapnel... in the Ardennes.
I quite understand.
Now, I don't appear to have received your CV.
That would be because I don't have one, madam.
I don't believe a man's worth can be summed up on a piece of paper.
It wouldn't be fair to me. Or to you. Or to any of those dear lads I left behind... in no-man's-land.
But you have acted?
All over this fair land, madam.
Well, we'll have to have a formal audition, of course.
But I must say, you're nearly perfect.
Yes, well...
That's what I was thinking.
It's me.
Peter.
You naughty boy.
Perhaps now we could talk about my contract.
Our nominees for best performance by a British actor are -
Richard Burton, Peter Finch Laurence Olivier and Peter Sellers.
And the British Academy Award goes to...
Peter Sellers, for I'm All Right Jack.
Your Royal Highness, you naughty man.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for this award, which I shall treasure.
You know, I went to consult an acknowledged expert about tonight someone who has published several pamphlets on this subject - my mother.
She told me to be short, to be sweet and be circumscribed. Which I am.
Don't we have any macaroons?
It would be nice to think me son were happy then.
He might have been, at that, if he could have been happy with "good enough".
Come here.
But "good enough" were never what his mother had in mind.
That boy needed a firmer hand.
I don't know.
Maybe if Peg had let us all settle down in one place for long enough... If Pete had had a regular routine, like I might have been able to teach him something about life the way I saw it.
- The straightforwardness of it.
We had to keep t'show on road.
I remember once, we were all in a café in Brighton, having our tea.
Pete would have been five, probably six.
We got down to the last cake on the plate and before I could ask who wanted to share it
Pete snatched it up, licked it all over.
I took it off him, of course.
He threw himself on t'floor screaming his bloody head off.
Peg just laughed. She bought him sweets.
Those bloody rages.
Pete always got the last cake.
- Even if it were on someone else's plate.
Mr Sellers. What does it feel like to be co-starring with Sophia Loren?
Soft, warm, a little like being a young boy in a bakery very early in the morning.
There she is.
Excuse me, which one of you gentlemen is Peter Sellers?
Welcome to England, Miss Loren.
"We have never had it so good."
Please, Miss Loren, to be telling me about your dreams.
Oh, Doctor, they started when I was a girl.
A girl. Goodness, gracious me.
This is a very good start.
What were you dreaming about, as a girl?
Boys.
So you have been crazy for the boys?
They were crazy for me.
That is not so crazy.
Such a funny boy.
- Excuse me.
Miss Loren, it's your husband.
I can't see.
Open your eyes.
Daddy, what's in there?
And here we have this year's Formula One grand champion, Michael Sellers dubbed "the human lightning bolt".
Like any professional, young Sellers gives his equipment a once-over.
This attention to detail allowed this speedster to leave Stirling Moss in the dust at Aintree.
Eyes clear, the ambitious Sellers presents a portrait of determination.
What's that, sir?
What the bloody hell is that?
I'm going to phone the dealer.
Hard-shell paint job.
I'll murder him!
Come and see, Dad!
- All right, I'm coming.
Dad!
Come and see.
Please.
I fixed it.
I made it look beautiful.
It looks just like a racing car now.
Dad?
Don't you like it, Dad?
You see, Michael?
I fixed all your toys for you.
Aren't they beautiful?
Come on, darling we're going downstairs.
Come on. It's all right.
Your go.
Two.
You know what happened this morning?
- You know Daddy didn't mean it, don't you?
You know it's not your fault?
He's working very hard. - He gets carried away sometimes.
- OK.
Can I see you for a second?
We're in here.
Hi, Mike.
I've got a surprise for you.
Say, pardner, come and say howdy to your new friend.
- Give him some apple.
Amazing. - D'you like him?
- I love him.
- Come round the front.
- Look, Mum.
- I think he likes you.
Big smile for Daddy.
- Let's call him Fred.
He's asleep.
Tell me honestly, darling.
Is it hard to believe that a woman like this could fall for a man like me?
Maybe it is something to do with the mystery of being in love.
I'm afraid, men we're going to have to take all these little cars to the toy hospital.
It's just not charming any more.
That's good.
I have to be more than charming, I've got to be passionate.
I'm starring opposite the most beautiful woman in the world.
Your son was terrified today.
I'm under a lot of pressure.
I could use your support.
You've always had my support, Peter.
It's my patience that I'm no longer sure about.
- Peter, what are you doing?
- I've been bad.
- Oh, Peter, come out of there.
Oh, hello.
Do you want to come down here and join the little people?
- Yes, my love?
Why can't we be a normal family?
We are.
You can't catch me! - Sarah, I'm here.
- Waving to Daddy.
- Champagne, Miss Loren?
- Please.
Thank you.
Are you tired?
I could give you a lift home after this.
My home is in Rome.
That's an awfully long drive, no?
Well, we do have all night.
You are sweet. But the studio gives me a limo.
Besides, you live so far out here in the country.
It's out of your way to drive me into town.
Great thing about town you're so close to everything.
Buckingham Palace is across the way if you need to borrow some sugar.
It's not the moving I mind, Peter.
It's just not knowing I'm moving.
Darling, I'd like you to meet Ted Levy.
I've brought him on as our interior decorator.
By Royal appointment. HRH, you know.
To lighten your load, an' all.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs Sellers.
He's a handsome devil.
But I figure a handsome man will be able to make us a handsome flat.
- I wouldn't go as far as that.
Now, Anne, Ted has got some brilliant ideas for this place.
- Mr Levy, was it?
- Ted.
Call time.
I've gotta go.
I've got to... I must dash orf.
You two, choose away!
Oh, have a drinkie-poo and make a night of it.
Ted, whatever's fine with Anne is perfectly fine with me.
Why don't I show you what I've got in mind?
Darling, you made it.
- Isn't your wife joining us?
- André.
What would sir and madam say to a little fish?
I'd probably say, "Hello, little fish".
Thank you.
- To us, my darling.
- You are wonderful.
I just can't believe my luck.
You are lucky?
How?
We are going to be very happy together.
It's so dark in here, hm?
Oh, yes, well...
We have to take precautions, you know.
What do you mean, precautions?
Should we tell the world? Stop all this sneaking about?
But, Peter, I thought we were having a friendly dinner.
It'll be relief to you, too.
Ponti's such a nice man. It must be hard, lying to your husband.
I think you are mistaken.
Go home to your children and go home to your wife, Peter.
She's right.
They should be the first to know.
Well, what d'you think?
Does this mean you want a divorce?
You know, I hadn't thought about it.
Not necessarily.
Do you still love us?
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Just... not as much as I love Sophia Loren.
What's he talking about?
I don't know, darling.
Come here.
Hello, Ted.
It's Anne Sellers.
I'm glad you're there.
I've had an idea about the colour.
Well, I was wondering if we could meet.
Yes, that would be lovely.
I'll see you there.
George, how are you?
Hello.
Are you enjoying being Sophia's stand-in?
Have you ever ridden in the back of a Rolls-Royce?
- Why, no.
- Next best thing to a Bentley.
Anne?
Michael.
You awake?
Hi, Dad.
What is it?
Your mother is sleeping with the interior decorator.
- Where are the children?
- They're at Peg's.
If you leave this flat I'm going to jump off this balcony.
Don't make me any promises, Peter.
All right, I'll meet you downstairs.
I had you followed.
The detectives asked if I wanted to see pictures. I said no.
- I thought that was rather chivalrous.
- How considerate.
You're not to leave this house again.
Come back here!
Anne!
I do love you.
I'm fucking bored of the little boy!
Why can't you be a man?
You're a miserable, lying shit.
I hate you.
I'll meet you downstairs.
- And cut! - Camera's cut.
Could we do it again?
I didn't quite feel it.
- There's no time, darling.
Fix it in post.
- Oh, all right.
This way, Mrs Sellers.
Oh, Peter, I love you so much.
I'm so sorry I hurt you.
I should never have slept with Ted.
You're the best lover I ever had.
I'm going to tell Ted I never want to see him again.
Then we'll go out and eat a sumptuous meal.
Then I'll make love to you like no wife has ever made love to her husband before.
I'm just going to freshen up and then... I'll meet you downstairs.
That's much better.
She's gone, Mum.
You're all right. You're with Peg now.
I thought if I just gave the world a little push it would all fall into place.
Well, at least you tried, dear.
Perhaps I should call Anne.
She left you.
Let her go.
I just don't know what's going to happen next.
Don't you worry, my little boy.
The future's ours now. And there are many ways of finding it.
Turn the light out, Bill.
Mr Sellers?
Maurice Woodruff. You wish to see me.
Roger Moore speaks very highly of you.
As he should.
Come.
The future is this way.
You are aware that green is the unluckiest colour in the spectrum?
- It is?
- It's positively fatal.
- You feel better.
- Immensely.
So, what else is troubling you?
You're the fortune-teller. Shouldn't you already know?
Even fortune's pump needs priming.
I keep making changes.
Big ones. And little ones.
Always hoping that the next one will be the right one.
I lost weight, I bought new clothes. I changed my radio job for a film career.
I changed my marriage into a divorce.
Nothing makes me happy the way I'm supposed to be happy.
One can't be happy if one's lonely.
The spirits are telling me that there will be many pretty ladies in your life.
You see, Peter...
You don't mind if I call you Peter? No.
You like pretty ladies.
You're quite a perceptive man, Maurice.
Hello, ladies.
Yes, it is me.
A very good day to you, sir.
Welcome to our showroom.
It's absolutely delightful.
As you can see we do have all the latest models.
- This is a sporty little number.
- Superb.
Or perhaps something more along these lines.
- Big grille on this one.
- Oh, yes, I have one myself, sir.
- May I?
- Please.
The Germans are amazing, aren't they?
How about engine noise?
She'll growl when you're hard on the floor, sir.
Rest of the time, silent as a kitten.
So, what will it take to get sir into one of these today?
A test drive.
Emma, how fast d'you run the quarter mile?
- Honestly, Mr Sellers.
- Thank you, Emma.
Blake Edwards. He's shooting a David Niven movie in Rome and Switzerland.
Starts filming next week.
Wants you.
Next week?
He obviously hasn't wanted me for that long.
It's a supporting part.
Peter Ustinov's pulled out.
Oh, well, yes, of course I'll do it.
Any part not good enough for Ustinov is perfectly fine for me.
- I'm not taking Ustinov's sloppy seconds!
I won a fucking British Academy Award for God's sake!
Are you going to overreact or listen to why your smart agent wants you to do this?
Apparently, I'm going to overreact.
Blake Edwards is the hottest director in Hollywood right now.
Days Of Wine And Roses Breakfast At Tiffany's.
He can get anyone he wants.
And, Peter, he wants you.
United Artists are putting a lot of weight behind it.
It's going to get very wide very international release.
You may be a star in Britain, but the folks in Duluth have never heard of you.
Well, we're even.
I've never heard of Duluth.
It's in the United States.
That Duluth.
It's called The Pink Panther.
It sounds like a bloody strip joint. For poofs.
Please. Try mine.
Excuse me, but aren't you Peter Sellers?
Not today.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to make our final approach into Rome International.
Please take your seat, sir.
Please ensure your seat belts are fastened and your seats are upright.
I'm looking for my tru-ung.
- Your tru-ung?
- What?
- You said "tru-ung"?
- I know perfectly well what I said. Right.
I don't understand.
Are you not familiar with Her Majesty's tu-ung?
Yes, I am. And I can assure you the word "tru-ung"
does not exist in our language.
Then I demand to speak to the person in charge.
- I am the person in charge, sir.
- Then I demand to speak with you.
- You are speaking to me. - Of course I am speaking with you.
What kind of a crazy stewardess thinks a passenger stands, speaking with himself?
What kind of a passenger puts lives at risk just before a landing?
Our lives are at risk?
Our lives are not at risk.
Now sit down and belt up.
I'm getting completely lost.
Lost?
Yes, we have a slight state of emergency.
French twa...
I want you to go very quietly and spik with the peelot.
- Peelot?
- What?
- You said "peelot".
- I know very well what I said.
I have a funny feeling we might be landing in Rome sooner than we think.
You be careful, Mr Sellers.
Carol, our guest has arrived.
Will you take his coat, please?
And he also looks a little thirsty, Gill.
Ah, yes, Switzerland. Of course.
Hi.
Blake Edwards.
Running things on a shoestring, I see.
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- This is Italy.
Hollywood is a state of mind.
I've got one or two ideas about Clouseau.
Couple of bits... Peter.
The script will be shot as written.
- Yes, but in the bedroom scene...
Look at his...
OK. You look great.
Let's shoot this.
This is where we introduce Clouseau and we tip off the audience that your wife is David's mistress.
We're in a hurry.
We only have Niven until two o'clock so we'd like to get it in one take.
Ready?
OK. He's only got one line.
Keep him in the frame, whatever he does.
Henri, you wanna take your mark?
Action.
We must find that woman.
Is that what you said?
Tell me you got that.
On the set of The Pink Panther in Gstaad, Switzerland with Peter Sellers.
Peter, how are you able to inhabit your characters so successfully?
Well, you see, I don't really have any personality of my own.
There used to be a me behind the mask but I had it surgically removed.
I don't know. If I didn't have characters like Clouseau, I don't know who I'd be.
Perhaps I'd be you.
But then if I were you, who would you be?
You.
So, word is, you're stealing this movie from David Niven.
No, no, that's ridiculous.
This... this is such a team effort.
David Niven is one of the cinema's most distinguished leading men.
One can learn a lot from people like that, you know.
Terrific, Blake.
Talk tomorrow about that.
Good show.
The Frogs will never forgive you. Well done.
- Thank you, David.
I'm not supposed to tell you but United Artists already wants a Clouseau sequel.
- Who's directing?
- Oh, probably some hack.
- I'm dead fucking serious.
- Peter, relax.
- You're not suggesting you would?
I was bloody awful up there.
If that's what you get out of me, I don't want to repeat it.
- You blame me for your performance?
- You agree I was awful?
- I thought you were brilliant!
- What the fuck do you know?
Peter, we're all going out. You just have to come.
- Yung Hi.
- So Mi.
Oh, that's so you.
I knew there was a pronoun involved.
Blakey, aren't you coming?
...the West End this year. Meanwhile on the American entertainment beat crowds continue to flock to see The Pink Panther.
One avid patron, waiting in line to see the film for the third time was heard to remark, "I love foreign films.
"Peter Sellers is my absolute favourite French actor."
Oh, you've got a hit. You shouldn't be here.
- How long has he been like this?
- Since last Monday.
You didn't tell me.
Peg said you couldn't come.
Well, I'm here now, Dad.
Bloke in the next bed... I promised him your autograph.
- I'll get right onto that, Dad.
He'll like that.
I told him... my son... who's a special boy...
No, let him rest now.
The reporters. They'll want some remarks.
You didn't call me.
Hello.
Is Mike there?
Do you know when he'll be back?
All right.
No, it's... Bye.
- Is Harry there, please?
- It's Harry.
I'm looking after Mike.
I thought you might like to pop over for a beer.
Oh.
Oh, is that today?
I forgot, yeah.
- Why don't we say Monday?
- Er, right.
- Ying ton, mate.
- Iddle i po!
Mike, put that down.
Put it down, please.
Thank you.
Go to your room.
Oh, Bert, you swine.
Here it is, here it is.
Welcome to my humble chapeau.
I don't seem to be able to get it in.
What's going on?
Good evening, Mr Sellers.
Oh, Christ!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
You're a hard man to get ahold of.
- Not really.
Linda, I'd like you to meet Stanley Kubrick.
It's nice to meet you.
So, er, Columbia won't let me make my next picture without you.
Awfully insightful of them.
What's the part?
All of them.
What, the whole film?
You can destroy the world, Peter.
Fine.
I can hear you now, Dmitri clear and plain and coming through fine.
Yes, it's good that you're fine and I'm fine.
And I agree with you, it's great to be fine.
Now, then, Dmitri...
You know how we've always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the bomb?
The hydrogen bomb.
Now, what happened is one of our base commanders he had a sort of...
Well, he went a little funny in the head.
Just a little funny.
You know, and he went and did a silly thing.
Oh, now, don't be mad at me, Dmitri.
Remember that time we were dancing with Natalia?
You remember Natalia the girl with the huge... arthritic problem.
Sorry, Stan.
I can assure you...
I can assure you, Major Bat Guano - if that is indeed your name - if you don't put that gun away and stop this nonsense the court inquiry is gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks.
The court inquiry is gonna...
give you such a pranging.
- Mr Sellers.
- Hilary.
- What happened to my luncheon?
- Your mother's here.
Shall I tell her you're in make-up?
No, I'll be right there.
You missed Sarah's birthday.
Peter, you know the press pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing.
You know, liebchen that is not chicken that you are eating.
Anyway, I told the man at The Times that you were busy filming that you'd sent your love and nothing was more important to you than your children.
I think he was satisfied with that.
Sarah made you that.
Eat your lunch.
You know, in ze comink years ze nuclear family as we know it will have ceased to exist.
All human requirements... will be dealt with cleanly and efficiently.
Nourishment. Leisure pastimes.
Sexual partners.
All zeez problems vill be regulated by ze state.
So you see there will be no need for food.
Or mothers...
How was lunch with your son, Mrs Sellers?
I don't know, really.
I didn't see him.
- Anybody home?
- In here.
- Hello, you.
- Sarah Sellers?
- I'm Sarah.
There you go, then, deary.
Let's have a look.
"For Sarah.
Maybe one day I'll teach you to ride it.
Love, Daddy."
Just sign here, madam.
Go and have a look, love.
Thanks.
"Boys.
"Boys, let's get this on the hump.
We got some flying' to do."
- Flatter.
- I'm not playing a bomber pilot.
What can I do with that crammed in there?
Oh, look.
Let me just hear it again.
Three characters is enough.
Three is a good number.
- You're being paid for four.
- You're stretching me too thin.
Who do you think I am?
I think you're whoever I want you to be.
Then who am I now?
Peter, have you ever heard of Mutually Assured Destruction?
Hum a few bars and I'll join in.
It refers to when both sides in an atomic conflict are so powerful that if either side were to take action it would inevitably result in the total annihilation of all concerned.
I find this concept can be applied to many situations.
You're a peculiar fucker, Stan.
Wait. Peter...
You've got no idea what it's like to be me.
Absolute control is a useful thing.
Eliminate the personal element... and you can get so much more done.
This was a realisation that Peter Sellers never had to face... because there was no person there to begin with.
He was a vessel into which characters and personalities ran like phantoms.
But even an empty vessel can become too full.
I'm not getting it!
I'm useless!
Sarah, your father is a useless talentless, empty man.
Did you know that?
Yes, Daddy.
Right, then.
- Dad?
- Use the other loo, Mike. I'm busy.
I don't have to go, Dad.
Please open the door.
- What d'you want? - Are you all right?
I'm not all right.
I'm not all right at all.
I can't find the voice for Major King Kong.
That's all I'm hired for. I can't find it because it's not there!
- Dad.
- Your dad doesn't exist!
Where's the bloody Seconal?
When I didn't want to play rugby at school I said I was sick when I wasn't.
They let me sit in the nurse's office.
She was very pretty.
Was she?
Morning, Stan.
I'm afraid I had a spot of bother getting out of a cab last night.
Damned nuisance.
The doctor assures me it's only a hairline crack.
Just don't let the insurance chaps find out.
Blake Edwards has got this new Panther script and Sellers is waffling so if you could help convince him to do it...
Exactly.
What?
Blake Edwards.
My girl will wire the money today.
What's the account?
The Midland Bank, Mayfair branch.
Account number 462501.
Right.
Thanks.
Not at all.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, a word of advice - don't even think of driving a red or a white car this weekend.
Not at all.
So...
Pink Panther.
No, too obvious.
Blake Edwards.
B.E.
Well, hooray for Hollywood.
That's extraordinary.
Peter, this is good news.
You're going to become involved with a very special person.
It's going to spawn a very fruitful partnership.
I'm even getting the initials.
It's...
V-E.
It's V-P...
V-E.
V-P, V-E.
No!
B...
B-E.
Peter, you must not let this person go.
Destiny's already written this chapter.
You must act positively.
So, say with me, "B-E."
Mr Sellers, sir?
What?
Mr Sellers, are you in there?
- Go away.
- Are you sure you're all right, sir?
Just take your fresh fruit and shove it up your arse.
Righto, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Britt Ekland.
Hello, Britt.
You must be Britt.
You're Britt Ekland!
Peter Sellers.
But call me Peter.
Baby.
B-E.
PS.
That's nice.
I like Swedes.
Mashed.
Hello.
I'm Peter.
Peter Sellers.
Like you, I didn't have much on this evening and I wanted to know if you'd like to go and see a movie.
I think I'm in love with you.
But you've just met me.
Then it's still fresh in my mind.
Cookie?
Yes, please.
That is very, very good.
Just look here. Super.
Now, just look here.
Look here.
Good.
Very nice.
I'll come in closer.
It's all right, I've met this sofa.
We're on intimate terms.
Work with me.
That is good.
Thinks, "Must take up photography as full-time job."
Now I need to get in closer.
Come the full length.
Mind if I sit here?
Oh, God, I haven't felt leather like this on my thighs since the Third Reich.
Get rid of that there.
Truly, truly beautiful.
She is the most extraordinary girl.
Like a tulip about to bloom.
Absolutely exquisite.
Phenomenal in bed.
It is funny, isn't it?
I keep saying that I'll never get hooked again, I'm tired of having my heart bleed yet I think I want to marry her.
That is, if you think it's OK.
Oh, decisions, decisions. - Will you come to my suite, my sweet.
- Drive on, James!
Ooh, it's the cops. Act normal.
It's all right, Officer, I'm fully licensed.
Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling.
Care to put on some music, love?
- It doesn't work.
- Don't trouble yourself, sweetheart.
There are many ways of making beautiful music.
Cheers.
It's a bit dark in here.
Could you get the curtains, darling?
What d'you say?
Would you care to become the second Mrs Sellers?
Better hurry up, love. I've only got the band for another half-hour.
I love you, Peter!
Do you hear that, folks?
- She loves me on a scratched film. - Here we go!
Peg, what do you think of the new cottage?
- You're watering the gin.
- In your case, that's not a bad idea.
You've only known that Nazi for three weeks.
Peg, I couldn't be happier.
Why are you making the same mistake all over again?
Because, my love, they won't let me marry you.
Mr Sellers, how's about a shot of you and your mum?
So, where's your honeymoon?
Where else, Peg?
Hollywood, US of A.
- Happy, darling?
- I'm about to be.
Oh, that's good!
You're very good, you know.
Wait. Wait.
- Breathe.
Are you sure you're my wife?
What do you mean?
Because no wife should be that good in the sack.
Is that what I look like?
Just one minute.
- Britt, call a doctor, would you?
Just try to breathe, Peter.
Would you wait outside, Mrs Sellers?
It's gonna be fine.
He's arrested.
- OK, let's charge to 120.
Clear.
- No pulse.
- Come on.
...Peter Sellers fighting for his life in a California hospital.
Mr Sellers has suffered a serious setback.
His condition is said to be grave and deteriorating.
No pulse.
Clear.
There you go.
Oh, God, Mother.
Mother, we've only been married for six weeks.
They don't know.
I don't know.
Damn!
- OK, charge to 180. - 180.
Clear.
We have been informed that his father also succumbed...
Having come to fame some years ago as a member of The Goon Show...
Both channels.
- Clear.
- Still no pulse.
- Charge to 240.
Clear.
Come on, Peter, come on.
OK, we got him back.
Hello, children.
Can I have a little fairy kiss?
The spirits have spoken.
Daddy's come back from the dead. And nothing can ever hurt him again.
You're still weak.
This isn't taking care of yourself.
From now on there'll be no more characters, no more costumes.
Starting next week the world's going to get a look at the real Peter Sellers.
What's next week?
Who are you?
How did you get past my guards?
Good evening, darling.
My name is Bond.
James Bond.
You know.
Aren't you going to do something... funny?
- Cut!
- First positions everyone!
How we doing, Pete?
Feel free to, er, improvise.
We're doing a spoof here, remember.
I'm playing it straight, as myself.
Like Cary Grant.
That's funny.
That's... that's very good.
Satirical, yeah.
Good evening.
My name's Bond.
James Bond.
My God, but you're lovely.
That was great!
Genius.
We meet again.
I knew you wouldn't give up.
- Christ, Peter. When are you coming back?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
Seeing as we're three weeks behind schedule, yeah, I would.
You know, Joe, I think today is not a lucky day.
Not lucky at all.
The voices are telling me not to risk it.
I hear voices, too, Peter! And d'you know what they tell me?
They tell me that if you're not on the set by this afternoon both your legs are gonna be broken!
I don't think we're hearing the same voices.
Peter, you wanker!
Get back here! Now!
- Hello.
- Just answering nature's call.
I'm not feeling very well.
Darling, there are lots of other bathrooms in the house.
That's not what I meant.
- What?
- I'm pregnant.
Oh, well I suppose you'll have to... you know.
What?
Well, have an abortion, sweetheart.
I want this child.
I've got two already. Have one of mine.
Peter, I want to be a mother to our child.
I've always... given you room for what you needed.
- Darling, is now the right time?
You are healthy.
We are in love.
Oh, Peter, let's have this baby.
- Bombs away.
Well, you hurry up.
And I'll go and call Mother.
Keep breathing, love.
The hospital's just up ahead...
I think.
All right, lads, give her some air.
Oh, we're fine, thank you.
- How d'you feel third time around?
- Ecstatic, absolutely thrilling.
You'll be fine.
Just make it quick. - We start filming in a week.
- Don't you worry, you'll be all right.
I'll take care of you now.
Goddammit!
Cut!
Take the fucking baby and get the hell off the set.
Please.
She's fine now.
- Off!
My big scene is coming up.
Not any more.
Fine.
You do it.
- Is that my Peter?
Hello, Peg.
What's the news from the front?
I'm in hospital.
It's the old heart, Peter.
Oh, well, we all know about that one, dear.
You'll be up in no time.
That's not what the doctors say.
They're trying to bump up their fee.
If they say you're dying, when you walk out they can claim they saved your life.
Come home, love.
I need to see you.
Nonsense, Peg.
All you need is a wash and brush-up and you'll be as good as new.
No, it's not like that.
Listen...
Just a minute.
Your boy's needed, Peg. You understand.
I'm a star now.
These people can't do a thing without me.
It's everything you ever wanted.
I love you, Peter.
I'll see you soon.
We'll go to tea.
See how strong he was.
Most men would have crumpled at "I love you, Peter."
But not my son.
He came through like a champion.
A star has an obligation to himself.
Family weighs you down.
You think he was cruel to me?
Of course he was.
That just means that he'd learnt his lesson.
There are no rungs for the weak on the ladder of success.
And my Peter is a strong climber.
Real stars don't have time for tears.
Can I get you anything, my darling?
There's nothing you could have done.
It's not your fault.
"It's not your fault.
"There's nothing you could have done."
- Oh, Peter, stop it.
- "Oh, Peter, stop it.
Stop it, Peter."
Christ, woman, can't you say anything real?
First of all you can't act, then you can't stop.
- You...
- Just shut up!
- You bastard!
- Am I?
Am I? - You've no idea.
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
You hit me with me mum.
Fuck you, Peter!
Fuck you and your mum!
Pretty num-num.
Oh, dear.
Well, Mr Sellers what would you like to look like?
Why, Doctor, I'd like to look like you.
You know how they clean theatres?
They put on one of my films.
It's so easy to hoover between empty seats.
Now I've found something I really want to do and I can't get anyone to give me the cash.
I've read this ten times in the last year.
The main character is a man with no self. No discernible personality.
I find myself thinking about this man a great deal.
About how sad he is?
No, about how marvellous his life must be.
He has no future, no past, no responsibilities.
He's simple, boring, an absolute blank.
People expect nothing from him and love it when they get just that.
This is going to be my next film.
- Are you absolutely sure about that?
- Absolutely.
Cos you do have a choice, you know.
- Have you read it?
- I've made some notes.
I think it could be very funny.
I don't like choice, Maurice.
You're so full of doubt.
How can we make that doubt go away?
We know, don't we?
Peg?
Peg, can you hear me?
Peg sees you, Peter.
Hello, Peg.
I love you, Peg.
What do you need from me, dear?
I don't know what to do next.
My heart's been troubling me. And I think, I think my mind...
Peg's here.
She's always with you, Peter.
Now I've had a look at your heart and your heart's fine.
Now what you need to do is work.
You give so much joy to so many people, Peter.
I can see it from here.
Do it for me, for your mother.
Do another Pink Panther.
Are you sure, Peg?
Are you really sure?
It'll be a huge hit. And that'll give you the power to make Being There.
I hear this one's not coming to a theatre near me.
The studio deemed its box-office potential as limited.
Then I suppose this comes at just the right time.
I could never be this broke.
It wasn't easy for me to come here, Peter.
Why, did your limousine break down?
I considered making you kiss my ass.
Not after that script's been through it.
Still the funniest bastard around.
Look, Peter, I didn't come out of desperation.
I think it's a good idea and I can't do it without you.
You need the money, I don't.
And I don't need the aggravation that you're gonna bring me.
What if I told you to fuck off?
I'd say your ex-wives will be disappointed in that attitude.
- Fuck my ex-wives. - I have.
Now I know why you divorced 'em.
Blakey!
You are the only son of a bitch who really understands me.
- God. I love you.
- I love you, Peter.
How sad is that?
This script could be terrific.
We'll give it the Sellers-Edwards touch. - I've got lots of ideas.
- We start shooting in six weeks.
Better make it eight.
I'm calling the shots here.
This is sure to be another stunning success.
How does it feel?
- Well-deserved, I can assure you.
Hello, my dear friends.
Thank you for coming out tonight.
I have something I'd like very much to say to you all.
We would not all be here if it were not for the efforts of one man - one man whose vision you will soon see writ large on the silver screen.
I am of course referring to Mr Blake Edwards.
Get him up here, folks.
Come on, Blakey.
Up you come.
Jolly good.
- Thank you!
Let me tell you something about this man.
He is absolutely talentless.
No, but seriously, no one - and I repeat that no one has managed to do so much having so very little.
Give me that.
People ask me why I compromise my artistic integrity by walking in front of Blake's cameras.
You know what I tell them?
Money.
It's true.
That and the knowledge that no matter how bad the picture is I'll always be the best thing in it.
- Thank you.
- Oh, look, he's bashful, folks.
Why shouldn't he be?
In an industry that worships mediocrity you, Blake, truly have added new lustre to the term "middling talent".
So enjoy the show... if that's at all possible.
I knew we should've gotten Ustinov.
You've reached the home of Peter Sellers.
Mr Sellers is unable to take your call as he is off leading a normal life.
Please leave your message after the series of tones.
Oh. Hi, Dad, it's me, Mike.
I tried you on the phone but Sarah thought you might be in Switzerland.
Anyway, Mum told me about the operation the pacemaker and everything.
That must be fun. I know how you like gadgets.
Well, anyway, I hope you're, er, you're OK.
Right, take care, Dad. Bye.
I'm just an old, salty sea dog.
Peter, are you in there?
Will you give me a goddamn break already?
You know something, Sellers you are a major league pain in the ass.
Was he difficult?
He was the star - of course he was difficult.
You know who's not difficult?
Troy Donahue.
I need a smoke.
I worked with Sellers for what 20 years, on and off?
Six movies.
I never laughed so hard.
I never cried so hard.
The last straw?
There were endless last straws.
You say, "last straw" five seconds later you're saying, "Action".
I can't explain it.
It was like watching a cobra.
You're mesmerised.
What did he do after me?
The only thing he never gave up on.
They all wanted me to be a clown. They'll pay me millions to be a French mustachioed, karate-chopping twit.
But this is so much more.
What do you want to do, Peter?
Isn't that what I just asked you?
Oh, shut up.
Yowser.
Ain't you the gentleman this mornin'?
I'm gonna go now.
You're gonna need somebody.
You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance.
Guess it oughta be an old lady cos you ain't gonna do a young one any good. Not with that little thing of yours.
You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?
Bye, Chance.
Bye, Louise.
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Aren't you Peter Sellers?
- Yes, I am.
- Would you mind?
Thank you.
Thank you very much. I mean you... you were... the man.
That's it.
You're always gonna be a little boy ain't you?
Bye, Chance.
Bye, Louise.
Mr Edwards. Pardon me, but have you seen Mr Sellers?
No, and he's 20 minutes late.
Did he call?
No. He's here.
I think maybe you should see him.
You can't come in here.
Ladies and gentlemen we are now approaching another great symbol of this country and one of the most famous places in Turkey the Bosphorus Bridge, connecting Europe and Asia.
In the last 2000 years many nations wanted to control this special place that was used for transportation between Europe and the Middle East.
This bridge was opened in 1973. And as you will be able to see, it is always full of traffic.
If you look further down, you will be able to see the Sultan Mehmet Bridge that was opened in 1988 after the city expanded even more.
We are arriving to Uskudar the Asian part of Istanbul.
Please be careful when you leave the boat and take all your belongings with you.
When in Uskudar, walk along the promenade and eat some of the fish our local fishermen bring in daily.
Excuse me.
Hasan.
Help!
- What happened?
Here he is!
Shalom, everybody!
Well done, Eyal. Excellent job.
- Thanks.
- Champagne, anyone?
Let's have a drink.
A real celebrity.
Give yourself a blow job.
MASTER OF TERROR TERMINATED
Not only in Israel...
- Are you okay?
- You speak to Iris? - Yesterday.
- And? - She sounds okay.
Strange. She's not answering my calls.
- Quiet, please.
Cheers!
Shouldrt we say something?
Well... To Eyal, who loves his profession.
Great job.
- Anything to add, Menachem?
- Very funny. I won't say anything.
Cheers!
Iris!
Iris?
Iris, are you asleep?
Iris?
Eyal
Menachem...
Fire at will.
You're in good shape.
- Thanks.
- How are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- Nothing special.
I'm glad you're okay.
Menachem asked if you could stop by his office.
Good to see you. You can't disappear like that.
So, resting?
Having fun?
The usual.
We're starting a new operation, right?
You didn't go to the psychologist.
I won't go.
Iris had therapy forever.
I'm afraid they'll ground you.
You know the regulations.
- Fuck regulations.
How is this related?
- How is this related?
- It was traumatic, so till you see one...
- I can't believe this shit.
Don't be so aggressive.
I'm trying to help you.
Go ahead, help me.
- Remember Alfred Himmelman?
- The Nazi you wanted to find?
You can put it that way.
- He's probably half-dead.
Who cares?
He wiped out all the Jews from an entire area of Germany.
Hardly anyone survived except me, your mother and a few others.
Himmelman lived in Argentina all these years.
Some dirty deal with the government protected him.
Two months ago, he disappeared. We don't know where to.
- What did you have in mind?
- Himmelman has a son in Germany whom we always kept an eye on.
He's not a child himself, has two adult children.
The daughter met an Israeli and moved to a kibbutz.
And a son in Berlin.
- How do I fit into the picture?
- The son is coming to visit his sister.
She's worried about all the suicide bombers.
So she called a travel agency to hire a tour guide, and I thought...
What? Take him to the Holocaust museum?
I think if you get close to them, we'll learn about the grandfather.
And I need someone who speaks German.
Menachem, let's be honest here.
No one gives a damn anymore.
He'll die by himself soon enough.
I want to get him before God does.
Hello?
Where?
Rishon LeZiyyon?
Shit!
How many killed?
Call Yaakov!
What do you mean, no answer?
Call again!
Menachem!
He hasn't come through yet.
- So dial again. - I heard about it.
- Galit!
- Menachem!
Shit, cell phones are dead.
Every time a bomb goes off...
Never mind, they'll come back soon.
Fuck them! Twelve people killed.
Hi. I'm Axel.
This is my name here.
Mr. Himmelman. Welcome to Israel.
- You just missed today's bomb.
We just had a bomb.
A terrorist just blew himself up.
- Where?
- Not far. Rishon LeZiyyon. It's a city close to here.
- Very close?
- Yes, but don't be afraid.
They never do more than one a day.
I mean, usually.
But maybe for you, they will have a second one today.
I'm joking.
- This music. They always play sad music after a bomb.
Let's hear some good music.
I've got The Doors, the first album, and Morrison Hotel some Dylans, Tom Waits and, of course, the Boss.
- You like Springsteen?
- Yeah.
Why not?
Pia!
Yes, that suits you.
Come here!
Careful!
Come here.
- Hello! - Hello!
Careful, you'll get all wet.
- You must be Eyal!
- Yes. Hello!
- Pia!
- I figured.
- Thank you.
- I just picked him up. He was scared when he heard about the bomb.
- You speak too fast!
I don't speak very good Hebrew.
Little Hebrew. But I am learn...
Great.
Well, anyway, let's go.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Totally crazy!
This is the "Maskeer," the director of the kibbutz.
It's my brother, Axel. - Hello.
- Do you like the kibbutz food?
- Yes, I like it very much. Thank you.
The fish is very good. It's from here.
- Your sister?
Very nice, your sister.
I told her if I not marry, I marry her.
We've got Rikudei Am tonight.
Oh, good for you.
- What's "Riku Am"?
- Rikudei Am. Israeli folk dances.
- It's fun.
- Do you know these dances?
Well, I know enough about them.
That's why I think I'm gonna leave you guys.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, no, please stay with us.
Yes, please.
- You disappeared.
- No, I went to get some fresh air.
This is fun.
You like to live here.
I must remember the steps and teach them to my children.
Hey, maybe you can dance with my sister now.
No, no. We're not allowed to dance with customers on the first night.
Sorry.
- That was a nice evening.
- It's always good.
There's not much apart from "Rikudei Am" once a week.
It's no Berlin here.
Very good.
- Who do you dance with usually?
- All kinds of people.
- No boyfriend?
Nothing?
How about our nice tour guide?
He's really tough. - I'm sure he's good around the house.
- He's like my last boyfriend.
And?
What came of it all?
Sometimes it's difficult.
People are very direct here.
They just ask you, "Was any of your family a Nazi?"
It's interesting that when I say yes, they look at me with pity but they stay friendly.
Nobody's ever been unfriendly because of it.
If you accept yourself, others will accept you too.
And that's where you're wrong, little brother.
You really are naive.
How so?
As soon as my boyfriend heard more about our family, it was over.
It ruined everything.
First he said it wasrt a problem, not my fault but he came back and told me that he didn't hate Germans, but he couldn't stop thinking about it.
He couldn't handle it.
Do you want milk and sugar?
I know, a splash of milk and one sugar.
Right, you still remember.
Axel, why did you come here?
Don't you want to see Mother?
They really miss you.
- Mother asked me to ask you...
- I knew it!
Here, call and tell them you tried but it didn't work.
Wait a moment.
What do you want from me?
I feel good here. It's good for me.
It's beautiful here. But why don't you call or visit?
- And why did you leave home?
- I'm still in Berlin.
How often do you visit?
Every four months?
Pia, it's not the same.
At least we have a relationship.
I don't want any relationship! You don't understand.
You can take the checks back too. I never cashed one.
Totally unnecessary.
Okay, okay, let's not fight.
I'm here to spend time with you.
And so Hansel and Gretel kept fighting.
Very dramatic.
What do you say?
You're wrong. There's something there.
You have to keep pushing.
- Be focused.
- I am focused.
What do you want?
- What's going on?
- That's my question.
We're finished soon, and I'll be back.
Right, Menachem?
- When do we start training?
- No rush. Carry on with this.
I'll come back.
Something you're hiding from me? No problem.
I'll go.
Relax.
- Good morning to you.
Why don't you join us.
Maybe I can use an egg.
So where are you going?
- You're not coming with us?
- No, I have to work.
I'll join you on the weekend.
Do you have a nice plan for today?
Well, we have many options.
We can go see Christian holy places or places mentioned in the Bible, whatever Axel wants.
There are so many places I wanna see.
Haifa is beautiful, isn't it?
And I also wanna see the Sea of Galilee, Kinneret.
Kinneret.
You seem to know the country pretty well.
I've always been interested in Israel.
I also wanna see Palestinian cities.
Can we go to the West Bank?
It's the other direction.
Why do you want to go there?
Why not?
I brought a few of my CDs.
Be my guest.
Let me see what else you've got there.
Many woman singers.
- Only women.
- Why?
I like female singers. When a man sings, I feel like there's something missing.
- Really?
That's strange.
- Who is this?
- Gigliola Cinquetti. She's Italian.
Fits in perfectly with the scenery, don't you think?
So how many children do you have?
- I don't have any children.
- But you said something about teaching your children to dance.
- No, I meant the children that I teach.
I work for this organization.
We help children of immigrants from Turkey and other places.
We help them with their homework. We read with them...
There's not much money with that work.
My God, you just sound like my parents.
Why? What do they think?
My father owns this big factory, and he wants me to work there.
- I see.
- He always expected us to join the family business one day. But then Pia left and I just told them I'd rather do something useful with my life.
So tell me more about your family.
Well, there's not so much to tell.
It's only my parents and Pia.
- No grandparents? - No.
They died a long time ago.
- Do you have any?
- What, grandparents?
Actually, even my mother died a few years ago, and my father.
- He died when I was in high school.
- Oh, I see.
- Do you have any children?
- No. - I'm not going to have any.
- Why not?
Forget it. You don't have to hear my pessimistic view of the world.
Hi, Pia.
No, no, no.
We're already in the North, why?
Oh, I see.
You wanna talk to him?
They had a bomb in Haifa, very close to where we passed.
What happened?
Another one of those fucking terrorists exploded. Four people died.
Shit.
It's terrible.
Did you ever think why these people are doing this?
I mean how desperate they must be to go out and kill themselves?
What's to think?
They're animals.
There's a lot to think.
They have mothers and children.
So why do they come and kill innocent mothers and children here?
There's nothing to think about.
He says his grandfather is dead.
I'm stuck with this pseudo liberal who talks about suicide bombers' motives.
I almost punched him.
Calm down.
What did he say about his grandfather?
- He doesn't have one.
- Find out more.
Maybe he doesn't know. Maybe...
Maybe he thinks he's Dolly the clone-sheep and never had one.
Stop acting like a child. Maybe you do need a therapist.
I don't need to host a patronizing German peacenik for the Foreign Ministry.
Why are you getting so uptight?
It's not like you.
Relax, have some fun. And if you happen to learn something...
- Whatever. I've got to go now.
- Call me later.
The Sea of Galilee.
So this is where it all happened.
Hey, Jesus, they lied to you.
It's impossible to walk on water.
You did it.
You can't just come to the Sea of Galilee and start walking on water.
If you could, everybody would be doing it.
You need to prepare yourself.
And how would you do that?
- Please enlighten me.
- Well you need to completely purify yourself.
Your heart needs to be like it's clean from the inside no negativity, no bad thoughts.
And then?
And then you can walk on water.
I'm sure of it.
Where did you go?
- I just went to get something.
- What?
We gotta do "Cinderella Rockefella."
- Rubbish, you're crazy.
- Why not?
What are you talking about?
- My little brother is drunk.
- I didn't drink anything.
You remember the song "Cinderella Rockefella"?
- Cinderella who?
- Do you remember Esther Ofarim?
Ofarim. Yes, I know the name. - How do you know of her?
- She and her husband, the Ofarims they were huge in Germany in the '60s.
- My aunt was a great fan of hers.
- She taught us that song.
Axel and I used to sing it at family parties.
We used to get dressed up as prince and princess.
Thanks! Thanks a lot!
Thank you, Tom. And now we have a surprise.
Our Pia and her brother Axel.
Go for it, Pia!
...first to the right...
- No, no, first with the left foot...
Yes, left foot forward, turn right, then a double side-step...
You do it great.
Come to Berlin. We'll do it at Father's party...
No way. You're out of your mind.
They said something about a party, but with no details.
Forget it, Menachem. They'll be here any minute.
I'm taking him to the Dead Sea. Via the Jordan Valley.
During the day, it's safe, don't worry.
I'll show him Jericho. He wants to see Palestinians.
He's such a nudnik. I won't stop in Jericho, don't worry.
I might drown him in the Dead Sea. Might be a world news scoop.
Okay, Menachem. They're here, I gotta go. Bye!
- Good morning.
Morning.
Make sure my brother puts on suntan lotion. He always gets sunburned really fast.
Two hours on the desert, he'll be red like a tomato.
No problem. It's part of the service.
So tell me. - Does she like living here?
- Yes, she loves it.
Does she have a boyfriend?
She had one, but not anymore. A guy she met in India.
- She says Israeli men are...
- What?
- Impossible?
- Yes.
I mean, no.
It's okay. She's not the first to think so.
Is it true that Israeli men don't talk about their feelings?
I don't know. I really don't like to talk about it.
So are you in a relationship?
I'm not so great in relationships, I think.
Do you know anyone who's good at relationships?
I guess you're right.
How can you ever know what a woman is really thinking?
They always complain that you never listen. "You're not connected to your emotions. You never cry."
Just never know when they're serious, when they really mean it.
What do you mean?
For many years, I was involved with a woman, Iris.
That's it.
Now I'm on my own.
Come on, let's take this stuff off.
It's an Arabic word.
It means "come on."
You don't have to walk on water here. You can float on them instead.
- You really never cry?
- Never.
Not even when you see a sad movie or hear a sad song?
It's okay, I have a good excuse.
When I was 15, the doctors discovered I have a rare eye problem.
My tear ducts are dry, so I can't cry even if I want to.
- Oh, shit, your sister's gonna kill me.
- What?
You're really burnt.
Okay, put some on your arms. I'll do your back.
So they didn't circumcise you?
I think I never saw one.
You know, we used to talk about it in the army. If it looks bigger and if it's better in bed.
I don't know, it's the only one I ever had.
Is everybody like that in Europe?
In Germany hardly nobody is circumcised, except for the Turks.
In other countries of Europe?
Let me think.
Italians?
Definitely not circumcised.
Also, the English and the French, definitely not.
Only the Muslims are circumcised in Europe and the Jews, of course.
I think it looks better circumcised.
I see you know quite a lot about it.
Thank you.
It's so freezing out here.
No, don't move away.
The only way to keep warm is to sit close to each other.
Every Israeli soldier knows this.
So how often does your sister visit you?
- She doesn't.
- Why not?
She doesn't get along with my parents.
I actually came here to try to bring her back to my father's birthday party.
- Birthday party?
Yes, my father's going to be 70, and we're organizing a party for him.
My mother thought it would be a great surprise if Pia came.
Sounds nice.
It's going to be a big thing with lots of guests.
You know, my parents live in this villa next to Wannsee.
That's where the party's going to be.
But Pia, she doesn't even wanna talk about it.
- Can I ask you something personal?
- Of course. I've got nothing to hide.
I've always wondered what it was like to grow up in Germany and then suddenly realize what happened in World War II.
Well, that's not such an easy one.
- Was your family in the...?
- You're changing the subject.
Okay, I'm sorry.
To tell you the truth, it's something we almost never talk about.
My friends, they feel like it's something from the past.
They feel like it's something we don't have anything to do with.
We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
It actually feels right to talk about it especially in Israel.
It's just that whenever I try to talk about it, I... I don't know, I never find the right words. I feel...
This is an interesting way to put out a campfire.
It's the best way.
They teach it to you in the Boy Scouts.
I told you, you haven't been drinking enough water.
Didrt listen.
That was beautiful. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Here, listen. That's an Israeli female singer for you.
What's the song about?
It's a love song, you know.
But what are the words? Can you translate?
Guess I can try.
"The two of us are riding in a car.
You tell me it will be a long ride. That I can fall asleep.
Later, you tell me everything that happened.
I'm not sleeping. I'm counting stars through holes in the blanket.
And you with a cigarette in your mouth singing along with the radio.
A love song. Kiss me strong. Kiss me until it hurts."
That's it, more or less.
It goes on like that.
Fire at will.
Shit!
What's up?
You're working hard, eh?
- Too many female singers.
- What?
Nothing. I'm just...
You're not... Do you have to report this?
Could you just...?
It's okay. There's nothing wrong. It's not that bad.
Have a nice weekend.
- Rest. Don't worry.
- Look, it's a problem.
The guy's in complete denial. He's been through a trauma.
It might be risky to send him on such a complicated job.
Are you saying that just so you can keep him?
I'll be done with him in two days. It's fine with me. You know what?
Check his results from today's practice.
I bet he wasrt good.
I don't know.
I can't give him up.
He did a terrific job with Abu lbraim. I need him.
I can insist he sees Rudy.
I'll convince him he's not just any shrink but the chief counselor.
Am I interrupting? No.
Just asking when you'll be done with this bullshit.
Just a couple of days more.
Menachem, we need to talk.
Just a second.
Take this.
Check the extra material on Himmelman.
Extra material?
I told you he's dead. What do you want?
Sorry.
Too much desert.
