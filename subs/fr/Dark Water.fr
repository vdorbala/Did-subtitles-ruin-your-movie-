Dahlia, let's go inside now.
She'll come soon, but let's go inside now.
What are we gonna do, Dahlia?
What are we gonna do about your mother always being so late?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you ring?
It's not 11.
You didn't ring.
Good.
You're early. You can come right in.
- You've been subletting?
- Right.
When my company moved me to New York, the rents were outta sight, so we only took a one-year lease.
And when my wife asked me to leave, I got a small one-bedroom in Jersey City that's cheap.
- How much? - 800.
Where will Cecilia sleep then?
There's a pullout couch in the living room, so when she comes to stay with me,
I'll sleep there. I can't afford two bedrooms.
How 'bout you, Dahlia?
We need to know what your situation is gonna be.
Any luck in finding a suitable place for you and Cecilia?
- I'm looking at apartments today. - Where?
- Where?
- I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.
There's a school there, it's great.
And there's plenty of cheap places to rent, so...
You got an apartment near me, it would make the shared custody easier.
Why do you want her, Kyle?
What do you mean, "Why do I want her?"
You were never interested in her before.
What?
You know, he forgot her 5th birthday.
- No. No, I didn't.
- No?
No, I didn't.
The plane was stuck on the tarmac, and we didn't have a gate.
I told you a million times, the phones didn't work.
No one believes you, 'cause everyone knows what you were doing.
- "Everyone"?
No, you.
Only you.
- OK.
You see?
She's crazy.
You live in a world of your own.
I make one mistake, and I don't care about Ceci?
- You don't like playing with her.
- You're insane.
Be honest with yourself.
You can't raise Ceci alone.
You can't handle it.
Just be honest with yourself.
Isn't it funny how small the cars look?
- Yeah.
- If you look at them from up here.
Fit them between your fingers, if you squint.
Yeah.
Oh, look. There's a tram.
And that's where we're going, Roosevelt Island.
Mommy, that's not the city.
Sure it is. Just a different part of the city.
No, that's the city over there. That's not the city.
- She's right.
- Mm-hm.
Here we are.
It is chilly, though, isn't it?
Are you cold?
Yeah, a little bit.
Yeah?
Hey, look, that's where you'd go to school.
I don't want to go to school here.
Why not?
It's too small.
Oh, I see.
Mm-hm.
- You know, I got your snack for ya.
- You do?
Yeah.
Are you hungry now?
Do you want it now?
- Maybe I'll wait.
- OK.
Let's just check.
Let's see.
540...
Just... 40...
That way.
OK.
It's nice here. It's like a small town.
I like the big city better.
Why didn't we rent that last place? That was really nice.
It was.
It was too expensive for us, honey.
We need something that's a better price.
But I don't want to live here, Mommy.
Why not, Ceci?
It's all the same.
And it's small.
Too small.
"It's too small?" I think you're too small.
- No, I'm not.
I'm big. - Small.
- I'm big.
- OK, good.
Then are you gonna be a big girl, and give this one a chance? Yeah?
'Cause otherwise you know what happens?
What?
My itsy-bitsy muffin.
I cover you all up with jam like this, and then...
And then eat you up.
OK.
That's us.
We are a little bit early.
We need...
Oh, golly.
Five...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are you Mrs. Bernstein?
- No, I'm Ms. Williams.
Ah, Ms. Williams.
Oh, you're early.
Mr. Murray.
We spoke on the phone.
Listen, since the Bernsteins aren't here, I can show you the apartment now.
You're lucky to get a jump on them, actually.
OK, that'd be great.
- So we'll just go up, and... - Thanks.
- Hello.
- Hi.
These tend to go pretty quick.
You know, Manhattan is so expensive, and this is practically in Manhattan.
- I mean, it's five minutes away. - Yucky.
This is yucky.
It is yucky down here, which is why we are repainting all these lobbies this summer.
And I think they're replacing all the doors, if I'm not mistaken.
It'll make it a lot brighter.
This is Mr. Veeck. He is the super for building C.
Hello.
Mr. Veeck, can you say hello?
- Hello.
- This is...
What's your name?
- Dahlia.
This is Ceci.
- I'm sorry.
Dahlia and Ceci.
Uh...
Mr. Veeck lives in 1A. He's been here for 20 years.
He'll fix anything that goes wrong.
- Which is a big savings, 'cause he does it for free.
There's also a doorman on duty from four to midnight here, so you don't have to worry about coming in late.
And that is the lobby.
Mr. Veeck, if the Bernsteins show up, just send them right up to 9F.
- OK. - 9F.
OK.
OK, so, we'll just head up here.
- Did you take the Tram?
- Yeah.
- Oh, you did.
Did you like that?
- Yeah.
You get to do that every day when you live in this building.
Oh, yeah.
There's the camera.
Say hi.
Mr. Veeck is watching us.
I'm gonna take you up to nine.
Almost our top floor.
I call it the lower penthouse level. Um...
You get some city views up there.
A little cut off, but you can still see the city lights, at night.
Oh, you know, we're two blocks from the school, which is one of the best in the city.
Yeah, I was just reading that.
- Isn't that great? - No.
- I don't like it here, Mommy.
I wanna...
- Ceci, please.
- Sorry, Mommy.
- That's OK.
It's OK. You're gonna love it up here.
And they just opened a pizza place on the island.
Do you like pizza?
I bet you do.
I like pizza, too. I like it a little bit too much.
Wait, sweetie. Don't run.
Don't run.
What the...
Get stuck in here, huh?
- Mommy, what happened?
- Sorry.
It's all right.
Dammit. Another puddle.
Sorry about that.
I keep telling Mr. Veeck he's gotta mop in there every morning.
You know, with all this rain we're having, you can't stop some of it coming down that elevator shaft.
There's just no way to stop it. Anyway, here's 9F down here.
The building was built in 1976 by Stern-Jackson and associates, in the brutalist style.
Um...
Now, what they were trying to create, as you can see, was kind of a little village, kind of a Utopia, actually, is what they had in mind.
And some of those ideas have come together.
Some of their original plans for the place were a little crazy, if you ask me, actually.
Hello.
Yeah, I just do that just in case.
It's vacant.
- Come on in.
- Shall I close this?
Yeah.
Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.
Our last tenant was a little messy, but we're gonna put a fresh new coat of paint on this whole place.
It's gonna brighten it up quite a bit. Let's take a look at your bedroom, sweetie.
This could be your room if Mommy wants it to be.
- What do you think?
Isn't that great?
- There's no air in here.
Of course there's air in here.
If there wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.
Uh...
That window does not open, but it lets a lot of natural light in in the afternoons.
- It's really great.
- Strange.
I kinda like it.
In the afternoon, it brightens the place up quite a bit.
Anyway, here's the closet.
You could put your dollies in there, or, you know, Mom could use it for storage.
- Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
- OK.
Come on, honey. Is this another closet here?
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.
The bathroom's pretty self-explanatory. It's in decent shape.
Once we clean it up.
You got the toilet, of course, the sink, bathtub.
This glass is safety glass.
I mean, you could hit that as hard as you want, it will not break.
And that is great for your peace of mind, you know, when Ceci's taking a bath.
Hey, Ceci. Come look in here.
Ah, you're right.
That's much better.
You can smell the river.
Can you smell it?
- Yeah.
- Let me show you the other bedroom here.
You know, it's tough to get two bedrooms in Manhattan, any of the boroughs, for under a thousand dollars.
OK, that's a closet. Scratch that.
That's a closet.
Um...
Kitchen.
Got the refrigerator, sink, stove, and this is kind of a country eat-in dining room.
You see this. It's just really smart how they did this.
See that little thing? Boom - dining room.
You can put your stools around it, and when you're done - out of the way, no clutter.
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining, very convenient to have.
Kitchen.
OK.
And then here is the other bedroom.
So, where's the living room?
Well, it's kind of a living room slash bedroom.
It's called a dual-use room.
You can see it's the size of two rooms.
It's huge.
Anyway, did you see the view? Did you see that?
Look at that.
That is a million-dollar view for $900 a month.
I mean, I don't even have that where I live.
You're not gonna do better than that, I guarantee it.
Listen, I'm just gonna cut to the chase here.
We could have this painted this weekend.
You could move in on Monday, and, you know, we could just fill out the forms right now.
I understand - you want some time to walk around, think about it.
- Let me just check on Ceci.
- Sure, sure. Yeah.
Ceci.
She's just making herself at home. That's OK, Mom.
Ceci.
You know how they are. She's just exploring.
- Mr. Veeck.
Mr. Veeck.
- Did my daughter come down here?
- What?
- My daughter.
The little girl I came in with.
The little girl.
Did she get on the elevator?
No. I see no one. Just him.
Yeah, there was a little girl in the stairwell.
Ceci.
Ceci.
Ceci.
Ceci.
Are you in there?
- Hello.
- Yeah?
- What are you doing down here?
- I saw someone go in.
Did you check the stairs all the way to the roof?
Ceci.
Look, Mommy. Hello Kitty.
I got a Hello Kitty bag.
Ceci.
Don't you ever do that again.
Do you understand?
Don't you ever run away from me, and you never come up on the roof.
- Do you understand me?
It's not safe for you up here. You could have fallen.
- Sorry, Mommy.
- OK?
How can you leave this unlocked?
There's no railing here.
It's totally irresponsible.
- It's supposed to be locked.
- Well, it wasn't.
Yeah.
Sorry.
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.
You're so lucky you found that.
My niece loves Hello Kitty. Did you look inside it?
- No. Mommy, can I look?
- It's not yours, sweetie.
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it.
There's no other children in the building.
Someone...
No children? Why?
It's so close to the school.
They all grew up. You know, they're all teenagers now.
You know, hardly anybody ever moves out 'cause of rent control.
Oh, there are other children on the island.
You know, in the other buildings.
You would have many, many friends.
So cute.
Mr. Veeck, why was the door to the roof open?
- What?
- The roof.
My daughter found this on the roof.
- The roof? Where?
- Just lying there.
Mr. Veeck.
Why didn't you lock the door to the roof?
- I did. - No.
She opened it and walked right out. Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck, and I'll call the union myself.
You get fired for cause, and you can kiss that pension goodbye.
What do you talk about? I check it.
Hour ago, it was locked.
- Someone else open it.
- Well, whose bag is this?
- What do I know?
- Well, look inside it, please.
I'm so sorry about this.
As you can see, we're having a little bit of a communication problem.
We'll work it out.
I was wondering if you have a card, so...
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
- Just don't wait too long. - Hey.
Hey.
Ceci. That's not yours.
OK?
You can't keep that.
Look, it's brand-new.
Someone's gonna come back for it.
Can you give it back, please?
- Doll.
- Ceci.
- Aw.
Poor thing.
- Good girl.
Thank you.
I'll tell you what.
Mr. Veeck will hold onto it for a week, and if no one comes, then you can come by and get it. OK?
- In one week.
- No one comes, it's yours.
You see?
You'll see, no one will come.
Thank you, Mr. Veeck. Please check on that lock again.
Thank you.
We're gonna live here, right, Mommy?
- What?
- We're gonna move here, right?
I want to. I really wanna move here.
See? From the mouths of babes.
- Excuse me just one moment.
- OK.
Talk about it, I guess.
Now, we don't have to move here for you to get a Hello Kitty backpack.
- I know that.
- You know that?
I really like this place, Mommy. I wanna live here.
You said it was the right kind of price for us.
I did say that. It's a little bit smaller than I hoped.
Please, Mommy. Can we live here?
I'm over here. Over here.
Over here.
- We'll take it.
- Oh, I have the Bernsteins...
I'll give you a deposit right now.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
I'm sure.
- OK.
- OK.
Yeah.
I have the forms here, if you want.
We can go in...
Let's go back in the office.
OK.
Ceci, you wanna come?
I'll be right back.
I can explain to them.
That's all right.
They have a lot of choices.
Come on.
'Cause it's insanely inconvenient, that's why.
I gotta drive through the tunnel, get uptown to cross the 59th Street Bridge to Queens, so I can cross another goddamn bridge to get to the island.
- You could take the subway.
- The subway?
You want me to take the PATH to the F? Are you kidding me?
It'll take an hour.
I'm suing.
What?
You move there, I'll sue for full custody.
Mr. Williams. Threats are not appropriate.
- Ms. Williams has a right to rent...
- Are you moving to Roosevelt Island?
- Look at this.
- I want an answer.
Look at this.
The elementary school there is one of the best in the city, and it's practically next door, so all Ceci would have to do is walk two blocks.
Just look at it.
If this is really about Ceci, maybe you could move to Roosevelt Island, 'cause there are lots of places for rent there.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Why?
- I already signed a lease.
- You're lying.
- I'm not listening to this.
- She's there.
She's in Jersey City, and that's what this is really about.
I'm done talking. Better get yourself a lawyer.
A good one.
I'm sorry to say that's good advice.
- Nobody came, right?
- What?
The Hello Kitty bag. Nobody came, right?
It's only been four days, kid. Don't get your hopes up.
Hey.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- After you, my love.
- Thank you.
Let's try...
- In here? - No.
I'm ready for something to drink. How about you?
Or maybe something to eat.
Ooh, let's put you in the box.
Can you hold your breath underwater?
- Yeah.
- You can?
How long do you think you can hold it for?
- Seven.
- Really?
Uh-huh.
Look, Mommy. Look how high I can jump.
Are you trying to break your new bed on the first night?
- No.
- Don't break your bed.
OK.
Look, Mommy.
I'm gonna reach the ceiling.
What is that?
Looks like a leak.
How?
I'll have to tell them about that in the morning.
Horrible.
- Anyway, what shall we read?
Wow.
The sound really carries.
Yeah.
- Mommy.
- Hm?
- Can you fix my hair?
- I'd love to fix your hair.
What do you want?
Do you want a ponytail?
Or a braid?
- A braid.
- OK.
You wanna practice for today?
OK.
Boys and girls, today I want you to meet your new classmate.
Her name is Cecilia Williams. Everyone say hello to Cecilia.
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi.
I think you can do better than that.
Do you wanna try again?
OK.
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody.
That's my girl.
That's my smart, beautiful, beautiful girl.
How's that?
It's perfect. You do it perfect.
You get your shoes on, which are right there.
Keys, which are...
I know where they are.
Shit.
Shit!
- Mommy.
- What?
- You cursed.
- Put your shoes on, OK?
OK.
- Do you need help with those?
- Yeah.
Pick up your finger paints from the back of the room.
Remember to mix the colors. Red and yellow make...
- Orange.
- Great.
Good morning.
Hi.
Hi, Cecilia.
You know what?
We are gonna have so much fun today.
We're finger-painting, so we're gonna get all messy.
Look.
See?
- The messier the better.
- That's fine.
Are you ready to come meet all your new friends?
Great.
Why don't you come with me, sweetheart?
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Wanna say goodbye to your mama?
Bye, darling girl.
- I'll be here at 3:30 to pick you up.
- Love you, Mommy.
Oh, I love you so much. Go have fun.
Come on, sweetheart.
OK, everybody. Listen up, now.
I want you to give a big, warm, huge welcome to our new friend Cecilia.
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody.
I'm Cecilia.
Hi, Cecilia.
Wow, that was great.
You want the elevator? Uh...
Actually, I was looking for you.
Um...
There's a leak in my bedroom ceiling.
Breaking news, huh?
Pipes is 30 years old. Leaks all over the building.
So does that mean you won't fix it?
Fix a leak?
Look, all I can do is patch up the ceiling.
If you wanna fix the leak, you gotta get Murray to call a plumber.
- Mr. Murray.
- Mr. Murray.
OK.
I'll call him.
Do.
OK.
So, you worked as a copy editor?
Yeah.
Back in Seattle, I did copy editing and some fact checking.
Why do you want this job?
Pay's not that good, sure as hell ain't interesting.
Oh, I'd try something different, you know?
I've always been interested in medicine.
Medicine? Oh, honey, this ain't medicine.
See, what you do is you Xerox their insurance card, hand them a form, and give them a pitcher of bug-juice to drink.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Come on, you can tell me. I'm not exactly a model citizen.
I'm separated from my husband.
My daughter and I just moved to Roosevelt Island.
You're a five-minute subway ride, the hours are perfect, and you have a medical plan.
Well, you're hired, honey. But you gotta promise me one thing.
What?
In six months' time, when you find a better job, please take me with you.
OK.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Mr. Murray?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
It's Dahlia Williams.
- Dahlia Williams.
- From 9F.
- 9F.
- Yeah.
Hey, how was that paint job?
- Yeah...
- Great work, right?
Thank you, but, um...
Actually, I have a leak in my bedroom ceiling.
- A leak?
- Yeah.
Did you tell Mr. Veeck?
I did, I told him.
He said that he could patch the ceiling, but that to repair the leak, you would need to call a plumber.
I don't know what he's talking about.
If he needs to open the ceiling and fix the pipe, he can do it.
He doesn't need a plumber. Listen up.
Just tell him I said...
Just tell him Mr. Murray said that he should fix the leak.
OK.
I'll...
I'll try.
Listen, say hello to little Cathy for me, too, OK?
Ceci.
Ceci.
I'm sorry.
OK.
OK.
Bye-bye.
Yes!
- Hi.
- It's lunch hour.
Just quickly. I spoke to Mr. Murray, and he said that you should fix that leak that I told you about.
Look, I'm not a plumber. I keep telling him.
I'm not responsible for building's plumbings.
My job is make sure boiler's working, mop floors, put out the garbage, but I'm not a plumber.
No, I understand.
It's just Murray said that you could fix it.
Well, I can't.
Hello. Wouldn't stop, right?
Took you up to ten?
Yeah, it does that sometimes.
It just goes up to ten, no one's even called for it.
I think when it rains a lot, it messes with the contacts or something. Which floor?
- Nine, please.
- OK, we'll take you back up, and then I'll go down.
OK.
Thank you.
Shit.
Come on.
Who did this?
This building is falling apart.
- Bye.
- See ya later.
I've talked to Veeck twice now, and he says he's not a plumber and he can't fix it, so I'm wondering, is there a super from one of the other buildings who could do it?
I can't do that. See, C is Veeck, and Veeck is C.
If I do that, then I have the union screaming at me about violating work rules.
It's really coming down now, and I can hear there's running water upstairs, so...
You know, it might not even be a leak. It might be flooded or something.
- Did you say "upstairs"?
- Right above me.
- In 10F?
- Upstairs.
You know, maybe it's their tub that's overflowed or something, I don't know.
No, that can't be right.
Listen, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna call Mr. Veeck personally, OK?
I'm gonna take care of this.
So don't worry about it. I'm gonna get right on it.
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
I'll call you later, as soon as I take care of it, OK?
- Thank you.
- OK. No problem.
Bye-bye.
Mommy, wake up.
Ceci?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
What are you doing here?
Take it easy.
It's flooded.
The fuckin' brats. I'm gonna kill 'em.
- You see them coming outta here?
- Who?
Asshole Steve.
3F.
And his buddy, dumb Billy, 7E.
- You don't know them? - No.
Look. Here's the story.
10F's away. Father's left the country.
Where the mother is, God knows.
They've been away for months. Probably not coming back.
Those punks have stolen a key and get in here.
- Why?
- What do I know?
Drugs. Wacky baccy, you know.
Look, I clean up this place, and then...
Then I come down to your place, huh?
Murray called me. I tell him I take care of it.
Yeah.
I patch it up tomorrow, when it's dry.
- No extra charge, you know? - Thank you.
The itsy-bitsy spider
- Went up the waterspout
- Then what?
Down came the rain
- And it washed the spider out.
- OK.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
You can be 10, even 15 minutes late.
We have this after-school program that runs until 5:30, so...
- Many of the kids stay for it. - Uh...
Is there a charge for that?
It's $30 a week.
- Which is actually quite reasonable.
- No, that's good.
That's good.
I think I'll have to do that, 'cause I'll be working till five every day.
- OK.
Well, we can set that up. - OK.
Surprise, surprise, there's another form you have to fill out, but we can do that now.
This will be good for Cecilia.
It will help her fit in faster, and she could use some real friends, don't you think?
What do you mean?
Well, it's not unusual to have imaginary friends at this age.
Nowadays we know not to bug them about it, but it isn't so great that she's playing with an imaginary friend when there are real children for her to play with here.
Are you saying that Ceci has an imaginary friend?
And washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
And the itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the spout again
I made you a snack for after school. I had it all wrapped up and ready to go, and then I was rushing, and I forgot it.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
- What did you think of your teacher?
- She was very nice.
- Did you make any friends today?
- Uh-huh.
Who?
- Nobody.
- Nobody?
Very funny name for a friend, "Nobody."
- Mommy.
- Nobody. "My name is Nobody."
- Did anyone come?
- What?
For Hello Kitty. Did anyone come?
No. Not yet.
Thanks for taking care of the ceiling tomorrow.
I appreciate it.
It looks really ugly now.
Good.
Are you gonna stay in my bed tonight?
Close your eyes.
I'm very proud of you for today.
Sweet dreams, honey.
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the waterspout
Down came the rain And washed the spider out
Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain
- The itsy-bitsy spider
- Itsy-bitsy spider...
- Went up the spout again - ...the spout again
Well, I still don't really know anyone here, so I'm not really sure who to ask.
Except Bill and Stacy, but he's Kyle's friend from work, so I can't ask him.
I think it'd be a lot easier for her back there in Seattle, you know?
Well, what about the mediators? Maybe they can recommend somebody.
Yeah, I asked them, but they're supposed to be impartial
- so they can't recommend anyone.
- Oh.
I don't know.
I guess maybe I'll try and find someone out of the Yellow Pages.
Dahlia, you can't pick some random lawyer out of a phone book.
I can't believe it. Those kids are up there again.
What?
Mary, I'm gonna have to call you back later, OK?
I have to go downstairs and deal with this.
- All right.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Stop it.
She'll catch you.
No, I'm not allowed to go to the roof.
'Cause it's dangerous, and by the ways, it's spooky at night.
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.
Is it your friend Nobody again?
Do you have an invisible friend only you can see?
Is it a boy or a girl?
Girl.
- How old is she?
- My age.
Almost exactly.
She was born a month before me. So she's older.
Wow.
What's her name?
- Natasha.
- Natasha?
That's a really interesting name. Where'd you get that name from?
It's just her name.
Night, Mom.
I can't go up to 10F now.
If I leave my post and Mr. Murray finds out, I'm dead.
OK, but if they leave the water running then my bedroom ceiling could collapse.
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.
But what you gotta understand is if I leave now I might as well go straight to Unemployment.
That's not gonna happen.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know if you want me to call the cops or something.
- Just give me a second.
Hang on.
- It's all right, never mind.
I'll deal with it.
And thanks for your help.
All right.
Mommy, come.
Are you OK?
Can I help you?
I told you.
I told you to leave me alone.
Mom?
- Get away from me, you little bitch.
- Mommy?
- I hate you.
- Let me help you.
I hate you.
- Do you hear me?
I hate you.
- No.
Just go!
Go!
Mommy.
Wh...
- What?
- You're scaring me.
- What's wrong?
- You were having a bad dream again.
Again?
You always make that sound when you sleep.
I do?
Ever since Daddy left.
- Stop doing that, OK?
- OK.
- It scares me.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
There's nothing to be scared of.
- Have a good day.
See you later. - OK.
Bye, Mommy.
Yeah, he was a frat brother of Joe's at Wash U.
Joe says he's as smart as a whip.
If he was at college with Joe I guess he's been practicing for a while.
Well, actually, he got a late start on being a lawyer.
- He lost a decade to partying.
- A decade?
No, seriously, Joe says he's really good and he won't charge you an arm and a leg.
- His name is Platzer. - OK.
- P-L-A...
- Right.
...T-Z-E-R.
Come on, Platz. This mess was sloppy, unprofessional.
I mean, I know I get caught, but my work?
My craft?
My craft ain't sloppy.
That much is true.
- Thank you.
- Hello?
Mr. Platzer, hi. My name is Dahlia Williams.
Hi, Mrs. Williams. John told me you'd be calling.
I can't meet till next week, so you give me opposing counsel's name and number and I'll give him a call and get up to speed on their issues.
Sure.
My husband's lawyer's name is Carrie Simmons.
That's OK, I know Carrie's number. This is not gonna be so easy.
We should meet Monday.
Where do you work?
I'll come by in your lunch hour.
It's Sutton Place Radiology. 585 East 58th Street.
You're being very nice, but I'm sorry, I just have to ask.
- How much is that gonna cost me?
- We'll figure the money out.
I'll call Carrie, get up to speed, then we'll go over everything Monday,
- including my fee, OK? - OK.
Thanks so much.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Figure the money out?
That's some sweet thing you're figuring money for.
- You gonna figure my money too?
- You're lucky I don't charge you double.
OK, so everyone looking at me. And do you all have a piece of tape?
Show me, show me.
Put it somewhere silly.
Somewhere silly.
Your forehead, your nose.
Make a beard. OK.
Now put it on the back of your picture and then you're gonna follow me into the hallway 'cause we're gonna put them up.
Ten, nine, eight, a-seven, a-six, five, four, three, two, one.
Beautiful.
- Anyone else need tape? - I do.
If it's not sticking...
- Mom, you're early.
- I know.
The subway was so much faster than the Tram.
I was at work ten minutes ago. Isn't that amazing?
I think we picked the perfect place to live.
Daddy doesn't like it here.
He wants me to move with him to that other city.
Oh.
- When did Daddy say that?
- Today.
He came to see what my new school was like.
Hm.
- I gotta go. - OK.
I'll be waiting for you.
OK.
Yeah, he came by to give us his cell phone number in case of an emergency.
He was with Cecilia for a few minutes. He said hi, he looked at the room.
Is there some problem? Is he not allowed to?
Is there some restraining order against him?
No. No.
I was just... wondering if Ceci was...
Still imagining things?
Actually, I'm glad you brought that up. Her imaginary friend hasn't gone away.
In fact, she threw somewhat of a tantrum during circle time when we wouldn't let her "friend" sing along.
I had to have her take a time-out.
I'm sorry.
I'll certainly talk to Ceci about that.
You know, the PTA provides a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.
She's very nice.
She comes every Wednesday.
It's absolutely no charge.
I'll talk to Ceci about it.
It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.
You'll see.
Couple of days, blend right in.
You won't see the difference.
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you.
You know, those kids were up there again last night, running around, and I could hear them running water.
So...
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna speak with Murray about changing the lock on 10F.
You know what he told me? Rimsky paid no rent this month.
- He's probably not coming back anyway.
- OK.
Well, that would be great if you could change the lock.
Starting to have nightmares about what's going on up there.
- Really?
You gotta relax, huh?
- Can I get you something before you go? Yeah.
Get me a reward for all this hard work I've been doing.
Yeah?
I think I have beer.
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink beer.
Coffee?
I could make a pot of coffee if you want.
Oh, forget it.
I've been working hard today.
I'm tired. I'm going.
OK.
Well, thank you.
What about Hello Kitty?
Can I have it now?
Oh, so sorry, kid. Somebody came by for it today.
They were visiting town, left it there by accident.
Oh, that little girl, she was so happy to have it back.
- You're lying.
- Ceci.
He's lying, Mommy.
Nobody came.
You want to teach that goddamn brat some manners, lady.
Sorry.
What is the matter with you?
Mm.
Mac and cheese.
My favorite.
I love you, Mommy.
I love you too, sweetheart. I love you very much.
But, you know, it was very wrong of you to call Mr. Veeck a liar.
- You know that, don't you?
- He is a liar.
Ceci.
You don't know that he's a liar.
- Yes, I do.
- How?
How do you know that?
Natasha told me he still had the Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.
I want to talk to you about your imaginary friend, OK?
- She's not imaginary.
- She's not?
She's lost.
Her mommy forgot about her and now she's lost.
Like you.
- What are you talking about?
- Your mommy forgot about you, right?
Did someone tell you that?
- You did. - No.
I didn't tell you that, Ceci.
Who told you that?
Are you gonna answer me? I'm asking you a question.
- Who told you?
- Natasha told me.
Stop it.
You stop lying to me.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Who told you?
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm just calling to arrange...
What are you trying to do?
Sneaking into her school, telling her it isn't any good?
Talking to her about my mother? How dare you talk to her about my mother.
Look, I don't know who or what pressed your wacko button today, and I don't care,
I'm calling to tell you I'm picking up Ceci Saturday at nine.
I'll bring her back Sunday at six. Don't play any games.
Have her there, 9am sharp.
- I tell you punks.
No skating in here.
- Yeah, yeah.
She's cute.
Daddy's here!
Hey!
Look at you.
You shouldn't be smoking, Daddy.
I'm gonna quit real soon, honey.
I promise.
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Satisfied?
As far as I'm concerned, you can smoke as much as you like, Kyle.
Honey.
- I'll bring her back tomorrow at six.
- OK.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.
Hey, pretty lady.
What's happening?
Laundry.
Excuse me.
I got some dirty things I'd like you to clean.
Sorry.
I forgot my smokes.
Help!
Smart-ass kids. Steve and Billy.
They did this.
You'll see.
Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.
They gum 'em up.
Brats.
- Who's Natasha?
- What?
Who's Natasha Rimsky?
Little girl.
10F.
Where is she now?
How do I know?
With her mother, I guess.
Couldn't stand living with that crazy Russian husband of hers.
Took the little girl with her. That Russki, he was a piece of work.
Always "blyad."
Look, there's a Laundromat down the block.
I'll get you some garbage bags so you don't get wet carrying them there.
The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Hi, Mommy.
Glad you like spaghetti and meatballs.
- It's my favorite.
- Your favorite?
I love them, Mommy.
I'm glad.
Mm.
I love you, Mommy.
You haven't said anything about what your dad's new place is like.
- I don't like it.
- Really?
Yeah.
Well, maybe it's just new and you need to get used to it.
But I don't wanna get used to it.
I don't wanna stay with Daddy. I only wanna stay with you.
Well, your dad loves you.
He'll be happy that you spent this time with him.
Itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain
- Honey, can you stop singing that?
- Why?
It happened.
I want to go to bed now, Mommy.
I'm tired.
- Mommy?
- Mm?
I'm scared, Mommy. I want to sleep with you.
Yeah.
I love you, Mommy. Thank you for taking care of me.
Ceci?
- Hello?
- Mommy, where were you?
- I was napping.
- No, not now.
Last night.
Where were you last night?
I called two times for you to say goodnight to me.
- Where were you?
- Last night?
OK, Daddy.
Daddy says he's bringing me home a half an hour early.
OK, Daddy. 5:30.
He says to be there in the lobby at 5:30.
- Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.
- OK.
I gotta go.
I'm getting chocolate cake.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dahlia, where have you been? I left two messages.
I lost a day, Mary.
I took a pill, just one pill, and it knocked me out for 24 hours.
That's never happened before.
And I'm tired, really tired. It's like I haven't slept at all.
Dahlia, are you OK?
Are you really OK?
My headache's gone.
But the leak is back.
It's back? I thought they were gonna fix that thing.
- Dahlia?
- Yeah?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
You have five new messages. First new message.
Long nap, huh?
Call me.
Message erased. Next message.
Hi, Jeff Platzer here.
I got the preliminaries from your husband's lawyer and I need to touch base with you about his accusations as soon as possible.
Believe it or not I'm actually available on Sunday afternoon until five.
If you are, would you call my cell?
OK.
Bye.
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yeah.
Hi.
I'm your lawyer.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry it's such a mess.
- No, it's OK.
I just moved into a new office and they've painted it.
I can't stand the smell so I'm improvising.
OK.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- So...
- OK.
Your husband's claiming you're mentally unstable because your father was physically abusive and your mother was an alcoholic who abandoned you.
That's... unbelievable.
What do my parents have to do with this?
That's my question exactly.
What's more relevant is that your husband says you suffer from crippling migraines and paranoid delusions.
He says he'll submit school reports that show your daughter is beginning to share your fantasy life.
"Cecilia is now having trouble distinguishing between what is real and what is not."
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
In child custody briefs, it's standard to make these kinds of accusations.
Don't take it too seriously.
But I do need to know what, if anything, in your husband's narrative has some semblance, some shred of fact that he might produce in court.
Well, I get migraines. Yeah.
That's true.
But they've never interfered with my ability to do anything.
You can talk to my doctor about that.
He'll tell you they've certainly never crippled me.
Um...
As for Ceci, I think she's a little bit lonely right now.
Her father's abandoned her and she was forced to move from her neighborhood.
So... she's developed an imaginary friend. But that's normal.
That's fine.
But for future reference, when you're talking to, for example, a judge,
I would stay away from phrases like, "her father's abandoned her."
It's important, when the other side is being so melodramatic,
- to sound like we're the sane ones.
- Right.
- That's all I'm saying.
- OK.
- I'd like to notch that.
- Oh, yeah, man.
Hey, sweetheart.
- Mommy?
- Yeah.
- Look what Daddy gave me.
- Wow.
- That's great, You're so lucky.
- Listen, next Saturday's a problem.
Can we do Sunday and I'll bring her first thing in the morning for school on Monday?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's fine.
- Come on, honey.
Say bye to Daddy. - Bye, Daddy.
Thanks for the Barbie.
- Did you do that ponytail by yourself? - Yeah.
- It's a good one.
- Thanks.
- I like the collar.
- Thanks.
Honey, you know what, I forgot to do something.
I'm gonna be right back. Will you wait right here for me?
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK.
Be right back.
Two... one.
Ceci?
Ceci?
Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.
Ceci, can you hear me?
Bake me a cake as fast as you can. Roll it, pat it and mark it with a B.
No more pretending to play with Natasha.
She won't let me.
Well, then you stop talking to her. You tell her I said so.
You tell her your mommy said you can't play with her anymore.
OK, Mommy.
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.
I'm sorry to call you late, but I think my husband...
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night. I can't talk.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
I just need to tell you this as soon as possible.
I think my husband is trying to drive me crazy.
Either that or he's hoping that I'm gonna act crazy.
- Hang on.
Let me call you right back.
- OK.
You say neither of the Rimskys are living there?
No, no one's there. So Kyle's paying these kids.
I mean, he must be paying these kids to mess around with the water and the backpack.
And the elevator.
I went into the elevator the other day and the buttons were burned off.
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night and I'm at the movies with my family.
If I don't want to be handling my own divorce, I gotta get back.
So...
I'll call you tomorrow and we'll sort this out.
All right?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Get down!
This time make sure you put it in the garbage truck.
- Where did you...
- Those kids have been playing games, moving it around the building.
And they were upstairs again so now there's water all over my bedroom floor.
- They're running the water again? - Mm-hm.
I thought you were gonna change the lock on 10F.
Murray didn't authorize it. He has to send me a 112B form.
- Look, is the plumber here yet?
- No, no.
It's only 8:15.
OK, look.
I left a message for Mr. Murray.
I told him I need my problem fixed first.
So when the plumber gets here, send him up to my apartment or you and Murray can both talk to my lawyer.
OK?
Do you remember what we talked about last night?
- Yes, Mommy.
- OK.
See you later, OK?
Hello. - Hi.
Jeff Platzer here.
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.
Listen, I did a little homework on Rimsky and I think I turned up the missing mother in a hospital in San Diego.
Why are you looking for her?
I figured the Rimskys might want to know their apartment's being used by strangers.
Mrs. Williams, we're never gonna prove your husband's behind this harassment.
And trying to do that is just playing his game.
He wants you to look paranoid.
We gotta deal with this straight, as if it's all on the level.
So that's what we'll do, we'll play it straight.
I'm due in court, I'll call you when I get ahold of Mrs. Rimsky.
In the meantime, just sit tight.
- I will.
Thanks so much. - OK.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Abigail's making a storm, sweetheart.
- Done!
Done?
You remember you have to sign your name so you know whose it is.
You don't want me to take that home and say I did it, do you?
I like that.
Pirates?
Stop it.
Stop it, I told you, leave me alone.
- We've got rainbows...
- Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
You're gonna get cleaned up and when you're done you're gonna come back and sit with me and we'll read a story together.
Then maybe we'll talk about your friend.
Go on.
Ceci!
Go away!
- Where is she?
- She passed out in the bathroom.
We don't know what happened. There was water all over the place.
- We took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?
We just wanted to check her out. It's school policy.
We couldn't reach you.
I had an emergency at work, I didn't get my messages for 2 hours.
It's allright. We called her father and he's gonna meet her at the hospital.
- OK.
Which hospital?
- It's the one right here on the island.
Kyle took her. They released her and he took her.
Did they say what was wrong?
They said, you know, it's nothing serious.
She fainted but...
I'm trying to find him.
I called his home number, I called his cell phone number,
I called his office number, and he's avoiding me so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?
Mrs. Williams, I need you to calm down. I need it, your daughter needs it.
Just calm down, OK?
I'm sorry.
I know you don't know me, but you have to believe me.
I'm not crazy, I'm really not.
- I believe you, Mrs. Williams.
- I'm really not.
Just go home.
Your husband and your daughter are probably waiting for you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Ceci.
Ceci.
- No new messages.
- Oh, God.
Hello?
- Hello?
It's Jeff.
Are they there?
- No.
- They're not there? - No. There's no message.
There's water everywhere.
Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Williams, calm down.
Calm down.
- She can't be here.
- What do you want me to do?
Oh, God.
I can't be her mother, I don't know how to be myself.
Ceci!
I hate you. Get away from me, you little bitch.
I hate you.
Fuck!
I hate you!
I hate you!
Bitch!
Sorry about this.
I really had no idea.
I would've come down myself a long time ago.
Better open it.
Hello?
Hello?
Jesus.
Look at this.
This is appalling.
This is appalling.
The plumber's on his way.
I'm paying him double overtime so he can get here tonight.
Hello?
- I'll get some of these lights on.
- Mrs. Williams?
- You OK? - I'm awake.
The plumber will be here in 15 minutes.
Mr. Murray?
This is just a big misunderstanding. OK?
Mr. Veeck did not keep me informed.
- Or she's staying at the Plaza, right?
- It will definitely be fixed tonight.
- And I want to talk to Veeck.
- I will get him.
You OK?
- Migraine, huh?
- Yeah.
- I'll keep my voice low.
- Thanks.
I spoke with your husband's lawyer and Ceci's fine.
Kyle will bring her to school in the morning.
OK.
Now, this part is gonna piss you off.
They want Ceci to see a psychologist to be evaluated.
There's nothing we can do about that but say yes.
So we're saying yes.
OK.
- Here we are.
- Mr. Veeck.
I had an interesting conversation with Mrs. Rimsky today.
She was very surprised to hear her daughter isn't living upstairs.
- In 10F?
- Mm-hm.
- You said they left together.
- That's what the Russian said.
No, she left without her daughter. She didn't think she could take care of her.
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic. She claimed she was going for treatment, and had to leave the girl behind with the father.
You knew that, didn't you?
Only Mr. Rimsky didn't take Natasha with him.
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky in Moscow today and she said her son is living with her alone.
- So he lied to me.
What do I know?
- You had to know.
Well, we'll find out tomorrow.
I have a phone appointment with Mr. Rimsky.
Why did you lie about the little girl?
I didn't want to get involved, that's all.
Did you see Natasha after her mother left?
It's a simple question, Veeck.
Yeah.
I see her.
I see her that afternoon.
I see her playing on the stairs.
Then the next day the father tells me she leave with the mother.
I ask no questions.
Well, if he killed her, it's not my business. "Killed her"?
"If he killed her"?
Plumber!
You got a lot more than a leak to fix, Mr. Murray.
Mr. Veeck.
- If you could just...
- Come on in, just right inside.
Thank you.
Some kind of pipe or something.
Yeah, well, see, that is a brand-new pipe. So, this will all be patched tomorrow.
- By professionals.
- By professionals.
Good as new.
It better be.
I'm calling NYPD to report a child is missing. OK.
I mean, I'm sure there's a simple explanation for that, but...
So, goodnight. And, again, I am so sorry about all this.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah.
I'll be fine.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm feeling much better, actually.
- I gotta go.
Family.
- OK.
Mm.
I'll keep my cell on all night and if you need me just call.
- Any hour.
- Thanks.
- Thanks again.
Bye.
- OK.
Bye.
She left you behind.
They both left you behind.
Help me.
Wait!
I told Murray, I told him a million times.
It's not my job.
I'm not a goddamn plumber.
How you feeling? You OK?
- You warmed up?
- I'm OK.
Cops think Veeck probably left the tank open and somehow she fell in.
They even think he might have discovered she'd fallen in weeks ago.
That's why he hadn't cleaned it in so long.
They might have enough to charge him with criminal negligence.
They'd arrest the parents, but they're out of state and there are no witnesses, so...
The truth is, they'll probably never know what happened.
Her mother left her.
The father assumed that she was with her mom, and the mother assumed she was with her father.
Guess everyone just assumed.
No one really cared what happened to her.
That's what it looks like.
I'll tell Mary you've been a prince.
You just accomplished the impossible, Mrs. Williams.
You actually made me glad I went to law school.
- Thank you.
- It's OK.
I can probably get you a year's free rent out of Murray.
Oh!
No, it's OK.
I'm moving.
- Call me in the morning, OK?
- Yeah.
- Come on, princess.
- Bye, Daddy.
Bye.
- How are you feeling? - Good.
Yeah?
OK.
I'll be here after school to pick you up.
See you after school.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Thank you for taking care of Ceci yesterday.
It's OK.
I'm really worried about her mental state.
- I am too.
- You are?
Yeah.
So, I've been thinking...
I don't want her to have to choose between us.
What do you mean?
I want to look for a place in Jersey City so that shared custody will be easier for both of us.
And we can do, you know, one week with me, and one week with you.
Or maybe split the week. We can see what works best.
- You serious?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, you know, you were right about the school here.
I checked it out.
It's good.
- Maybe I could get a place...
- No, it's fine.
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.
I'll see you later.
- When are we moving?
- Not until next week, sweetheart.
This is winter stuff though so we can pack it up now.
You OK?
Are you feeling OK?
What are you thinking about?
Why did her mommy forget about her?
Do you know how much I love you?
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.
Do you know I would do anything for you?
Yes.
That's a promise.
- Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
- Uh-huh.
There you are.
That's so great, Dahlia.
Well, I think it's gonna be for the best.
And moving out of here, that is definitely for the best.
What do you want to do?
Be a chef? OK.
Let's see if we can make you a chef hat.
There.
Now, what are you going to cook?
Mac and cheese?
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the tub before she turns into a prune.
- She's so cute.
- So... Oh!
Here she is now.
Yeah.
So I will talk to you tomorrow. - OK.
Take care.
Bye.
- OK.
You too.
Goodnight.
- Mommy, can you read me a story?
- Course I can, honey.
Let's see which one you picked.
We haven't read this one in a long time, have we?
"There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child."
We need more snow, don't you think?
Then let's get some more snow.
...beautiful Rapunzel.
Don't leave me. I want you to be my mommy.
- Don't leave me.
- Ceci!
You can't leave me.
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
No!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Ceci!
Oh, God.
Let her go!
You let her go!
No!
No!
Please!
Natasha!
Let her go!
Please.
We'll stay.
We'll stay here with you.
What do you want?
I'll be your mother.
- Please.
- Forever?
Forever.
Forever.
Yes.
I'll be your mother forever.
Take me.
Please, take me.
Yeah, OK.
So we got an 11-46, Caucasian female, aged 30, no apparent cause of death, and a six-year-old girl with shock.
Trying to locate the father.
Ceci.
Let's go home, honey. Would you get the door?
We did a whole bunch of them. A whole neighborhood.
What was this one about? Do you remember?
That was me and then that was you.
- That was a tree.
- A tree.
- And then that's a little angel. - Beautiful gold wings on the angel.
Come on.
OK, honey, let's walk.
What's wrong with you?
Come on.
Ceci.
Ceci?
Ceci?
Open the door. Push the button, Ceci.
Open it.
Open the door.
Ceci!
My beautiful girl.
Whenever you need me, I'm here.
OK, Daddy.
Let's go.
C'mon! C'mon!
I got a baby-sitter.
I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go on my own.
Trace!
You got some clothes here, haven't ya?
C'mon, show us! Hey, Tran, don't you reckon Tracy should come to the school reunion?
Yeah.
Is that right? Tracy never goes out.
Listen. We'll have a look here.
You're alright?
Yeah! Good.
G'day.
How was it?
It was okay.
Did she behave herself?
Yeah, not a problem.
How was that?
It was alright.
Can we go? I'll drive.
Can you give me a ride home?
No.
You can walk, fatso.
Excuse me.
Come here.
I had a message from Lionel Dawson on my phone.
How did he get my number?
Don't stay hitting away
They play this one. You should come.
I wish you were there.
You're gonna stay very long?
Kind of got sick of this. I thought you were dead.
I got my sun messy.
Mom was there. I had to drive her home.
Well, I gave her another call but no, she didn't call back.
You should go see her.
Yeah. Yeah, I've been thinking about that.
What's up?
Nah! Someone's, you know, dropping something off for me.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I didn't know you were coming.
Go on, right on the front room.
Sorry, darling.
Just a moment, Steven.
Brad!
What an honor.
Lionel.
I'll get you a drink.
Working hard?
I've sold quite a few jerseys this week.
Li!
Lionel!
Tracy!
It's all yours now, mate.
Yeah, partnership's dissolved.
I understand. It's all up to you now.
So, that's it.
Yeah, you're retiring.
That's great!
As to this particular arrangement.
That's it. The enamel packages.
This is not for me.
Yeah. Interesting timing.
Like I've been making arrangements for detox.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I reckon this will be good for us.
Clear the air.
Won't be so dependant at last.
You'll have more time not working.
We can take up golf. Snooker. Fucking bridge.
You're alright, then.
Yeah, I couldn't be happier.
It just began.
Good luck, mate.
Sorry. I... forgot you were there.
Yeah, you did.
It's you, ey?
Shinny girl.
I've gotta go.
I have to stay.
It was spectacular.
Jesus Christ, Lionel!
Don't get on when I'm here, alright?
You wait till I go!
I thought you'd go in there and-
Do you want this?
No.
I'll see ya.
See ya, love.
Trace, are you up?
Tracy, this business plan Is good,
It's very good, You've obviously done a lot of research,
It's very impressive,
And this address where you live, Is this rented property?
That's my mom's house.
It's rented, yeah.
In the last four years there's steady employment, but there's no savings, no capital.
You don't own a car?
No, I've had some debts to pay off.
We do a credit check on all loan applications and it is quite colorful your file, Tracy.
This isn't really really safe estimate.
Did you, did you see these?
We get people coming in to the shop all the time asking if we've got internet, 'cause we're so close to the station. The nearest place is-
It's-
Tracy, this is not a personal decision. This is the bank's policy.
I cannot approve an unsecured line against someone with your history.
Sorry.
Look, if you can come back with some collateral we might be able to talk again. But the way it's currently structured I can't approve that loan.
What?
No, no, I won't do it.
No, Ray, I said no.
Hey, Trace,
The manager said the plan was, uhm,
What did he say?
It's impressive.
Impressive?
So, we'll sign off our new shop on Monday.
That gives you a week.
Will the bank be able to transfer the money by then?
By Monday?
Yeah!
Oh! Did you tell your mom?
Trace... did you call you mom?
Yeah, on the mobile.
Net one plan.
Do they have any computers can we actually fit in there?
Some shoes for your brother.
Ray gets his shoes done by that guy of the street.
I'm seeing him tonight.
How is he going?
Come on, kids. Ray is Ray.
Hey, thanks for opening up this morning.
No problem.
That'd be 12.
Sorry?
Computers.
Next door.
Cool. I'll see ya.
See ya. Girls!
Wait up.
Hello. Ray Heart speaking.
This is where I work.
You get down here and get the shit out of my shop.
Do you hear me, Ray?
Yeah.
I'll get back to you in about five minutes, alright?
I'll call you straight back.
Shit.
Okay? Forty'd be good.
See you tonight?
Yeah, give us a kiss.
Is it alright if I bring a friend over for dinner?
Friend?
Yeah, I do have him.
Good.
It's okay.
See you tonight.
Hi, Trace.
Don't hang up on me, Ray.
You get down here and get this fucking shit out of my shop or I'll throw it in the bin.
Just get here.
I have to get a bus. I've only got ten bucks to last me 'till Friday and it's Tuesday.
Can you hold on to it 'till tonight for me, Trace?
It'd be a birthday present.
Last time, Ray.
Sorry.
Your password?
I suppose a cup of tea is out of the question.
How's Ray?
He's good.
There's milk if you-
No, still have it black.
Tracy's doing well?
Yes, she is. Lionel, what are you doing here?
Just came round to say hello, that's all.
Say hello. Haven't been to a show in years.
You and the kids and me.
Had some times, ey?
Mainly in club and races.
Beach.
I miss you.
Lionel, you gave my daughter heroin.
She's clean now.
She's good.
This is for you.
I don't want anything from you.
You can call a cab. It's Ray's birthday.
I'm cooking his favorite dinner.
Tracy will be home soon.
And you were never here.
Tran, I don't mind you singing on the ship, but you got to get the work done, too.
Remember we got that special?
Two DVDs and you get a pack of that crap popcorn.
Give it away, Tran.
Want me to pick him up later?
No, mate. I'll put him in a taxi.
Unless you want to stay and watch the cable.
I gotta get home.
G'day, mate.
Over there.
Ray Heart?
Yeah. Thanks for coming out here.
Yeah. I got you a beer.
No, thanks.
So... is there a problem?
I got some money together with a friend of mine. We're looking for opportunities to-
How much money?
About 30 grand.
No bullshit.
Why would I do that, mate?
We're good for it.
Fair enough.
Give us a call tomorrow and I'll see what we can do.
Thanks.
Well, he said a friend.
Isn't that what a friend means?
Could be someone he talked to at the bus stop.
Look, it's his birthday.
Trace, get the door, will ya?
Why is he at the front-
You know where the key is.
Shit!
Ray's not here yet?
I'll let you in the front.
Is that Ray?
It's Jonny.
Isn't he in Vancouver?
Shit.
Janelle?
Oh, well, what have we got here?
Come in.
Duty free.
Do you still smoke?
Ray told you I was coming here?
When did you get back?
A couple of days ago.
Thanks. Here.
This is for you.
Not real ones.
Why are you wearing a suit?
Why I am wearing a suit?
Hey! How are you going, Ray?
Shit.
So, you know, in Vancouver people are making money 24-7 and that's all they do.
They work and sleep.
I don't suppose they sleep much.
That sounds like shit.
You've been there, Janelle?
Overseas I've been in New Zealand, Fiji, and Bali.
How long are you back for?
For good. Yeah.
I've got a job offer here, so-
What sort of a job?
A trader with a stockbroker.
I worked with my uncle in Canada in his company.
They do the Asian market.
It'd be pretty good money, wouldn't it?
Yeah. It's alright.
I'm also thinking about importing those flowers I gave you.
Thanks.
How are you going?
Good. She's doing great. She's opening her own shop.
Mom, I'm going into partnership with Ming in my work at the video shop.
We're expanding into internet on-line gaming.
And the bank.
Yeah. The bank approved my loan today.
That's great!
That's amazing.
No, no, really!
That is amazing.
Don't just drop them in a plate.
How many times have I done this?
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Don't drink it all.
Anything but alcohol.
A speech, Ray.
Get fucked.
I want a big bit.
I'd like to say a few words.
Just a few, mom?
Ray's 30. My baby's 30.
Five years ago on this night,
I stayed in a hospital emergency room not knowing if you were gonna live.
I never wanna go through another night like that in my life.
It was a bad night.
Bad night. And three years of rehab for Ray and me.
People from the past knocking at the door.
I suppose you think about it. The accident.
Every day, Janelle.
So, when do you start work?
Friday. In the city.
So I suppose now you'll be moving out to Stratfield, somewhere.
I don't know.
I'm just staying with Kim and June for now. You probably have noticed this but people have been running from this place. Almost everyone.
All the houses have changed hands.
Or kicking themselves.
Prices around here have gone up. People just want the best they can for their families.
Oh, right, and I don't!
That's not what I meant.
Five years ago one's nearly killed in a car crash. Other one is about to become a fully blind junkie or find himself in jail. Or maybe bloody both!
So, what do I do?
Can I send them off to a rich family overseas?
No.
Can I get Tracy into the clinics to get her clean?
No! Mom, sit down.
It'll be alright.
No matter what you do, always someone's there to smooth it over.
Need it? Get it, sign the check.
That would be alright.
Maybe you shouldn't have married such a loser asshole then.
You gonna blame your dad for the rest of your life?
Probably yeah.
Janelle, you would have done the same things if you had the money.
But I don't. I didn't, I never did.
You say you don't understand these people. They're doing what you would do if you could.
Oh, I've had enough.
Happy fucking birthday, Ray.
Should I take it?
So you can be all in.
Yes, thank you.
That will be very nice.
I'm fine, thank you.
Okay, there you go.
Darling.
It's alright now.
Ray. Thanks for the shoot.
Good night.
Ray.
I'm gonna bed.
Trace, are we gonna fit 12 computers In here?
Yeah, easily.
Yeah, good.
This is cool.
Fix the place up. Make a bit of money. And you can refinance and buy me out.
What would you do?
Oh, I'll be up at businesses. Other things I wanna do.
No, no, no.
C'mon, Trace!
Why not? You've been doing it for four years.
You know, it's bad luck for tears to fall in the ground of a new business.
Bullshit.
Just think about it, ey?
Yeah, right.
Thanks.
You know, you should have told your mom I was coming last night, prick.
Yeah, absolutely.
Give us a look at that fun, will you?
This is weird.
What?
I don't know. I just feel- Seeing you again we'll be more together.
What about this?
Did you speak to that guy?
Moss?
I told him we had 30 grand, mate, and his eyes went like this.
C'mon, let's get out of here. I want you to take me somewhere, will you?
Ray, I can't drive like this.
What's wrong?
You're worried you might have a crash?
Sorry.
Thanks, mate.
No worries.
Change those prices for me.
No worries.
You're alright? Yeah. I've just got a bit of a cold.
I'll drop in, uh, later in the way.
I'll give you a ring.
Hello? Tracy, it's me.
How did you get my number?
Ray.
Ray gave it to me.
It's hard.
It's hard being back.
It's harder than I thought.
Tracy, you're there?
I gotta go.
See ya. Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
You're okay?
Yeah.
You're okay?
Yeah, just wanna get home.
And Jonny wouldn't speak.
He had just lost his parents.
A feeling I will never forget.
As time goes on-
But Jonny has been in Vancouver for four years.
He has been working very hard. And he has a new job here in Sydney.
A stockbroker.
Today is 20 years since I married June.
June, thank you.
I don't know, Lionel.
You've got to do something.
Never had to pay for it.
A straight price?
I never had to find it.
No, I won't stand up in front of a bunch of people and say that I was wrong, that my life was wrong, because it wasn't.
It isn't. I gotta strip for this Salbutan and just wait.
Really?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
One week and I'm clean.
One week?
Yeah, right.
M'mmmm.
How good is that?
Yummy.
Aren't you having any? No.
Jonny's back.
Eh?
How is he?
He's great.
He's clean. He's a stockbroker.
Let him on the phone in the morning.
Most stupid.
No.
No boyfriend causes such a commotion. What does that say?
It's okay.
Yeah.
Is it?
Yeah, it is.
It's great.
The look on your face after you spoke to him.
And now it's beyond that.
I'd kill for that feeling.
You got your stuff?
Trace... I haven't been to the beach for years and what is all.
Like I'm on public. I'll take you to the beach.
You're my darling.
Eat something.
Bye-bye.
See you, darling.
Do you like trading?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do. It's fun playing with other people's money, you know.
I'm impressed.
A car.
Mr. Cool C.
The car's me uncle's.
Tracy. How you're going?
I'm good.
What are you doing?
Now?
Yes. Nothing.
Do you-
Do you wanna meet up?
Yeah, we could meet on the corner, you know.
I don't have a car.
I can, I can pick you up.
At 7: 00?
I'll take you to the city.
This is a really cool restaurant. Yeah, right.
Alright.
Okay.
You wanna drive?
How are you going?
Good.
You look great.
You really changed since I left.
Tracy, You know I- I didn't have a choice.
My uncle sent me away and my bags were packed.
Four years.
Yeah.
Anyway, look at you. You look great.
Yeah, 32.
Living home with my mom and work in a video shop.
Do you think if I'd stayed, you'd be clean now?
Fuck knows where we'd be.
What do you wanna eat?
I bet the food is pretty good here.
Is that what you heard?
Like you read restaurant reviews.
Certain times I do, yeah.
Are you ready to order?
What'd you like?
You're okay?
I don't wanna be here.
I'm wanna go.
Tracy. No, I just wanna go home, okay?
This is a bad idea.
Where are you going? I'm going home. Let me drive.
No, no, no.
Don't grab me!
Don't think you can fucking... grab me.
Tracy, c'mon.
What am I doing here?
This is so easy for you!
Is it easy?
What do you reckon, huh?
I want to drive you home, okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
Is that loaded?
Nah, it's my farewell present when I sold the bar in the Philippines.
Some bastard tried to impress me.
I never used it.
It's beautifully handcrafted.
Why don't you keep it?
I'm retiring.
Oh, no.
No, I want you to have it.
I'm not a collector, mate.
Do you want a beer?
I poured you one.
No, I might keep going.
There's some white wine in the fridge.
Jenny's getting a bit jacked up at me showing up late. So, if there's nothing else, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, alright.
At 10: 00?
Sure.
Hey, what ever happened to that Barky couple who ran the speed factory for us?
Merv and Eileen.
Where did they go?
Kangaroo Valley, I think.
They've got some goats up there.
Goats.
I just wanna get things finalized. Lawyer's on the case.
You understand?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Steven, just sit down for a minute, will you?
I know you wanna get back to your family.
Come.
I know some things about me that you found... difficult.
I wanna say this.
I know what sort of man you are, and your thoughts about such matters won't make things- I'm not one to judge, mate.
I just wanna...thank you for your trust and discretion.
Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, alright.
Right.
Bradly's got no idea.
He hasn't been down to the speed factory in years.
He just wants to fuck boys and play golf.
What if he goes down there?
Well, then he does.
Merv and Eileen can deal with it. Honestly, Stevy.
Is there any blood?
Is she alright?
Just a little bit.
My bunny, my bunny.
Oh, that's alright 'cause we've got him now!
We silly duffers.
These toys are shit.
Bloody dangerous, too.
You know, Tiny and Jean have got a new floor. You can just lay straight over the slab.
Yeah? Good.
Here we go.
It's okay, it's okay, honey. There you go.
Sh, sh, sh, There.
So, this is what we're doing.
So, we can save for a whole new floor and we can have it.
It's worth it.
Tracy, you're brother's here, C'mon, please,
He's not here.
Having a good perv?
You're losing your touch.
Why didn't you wake me? I missed my swim.
I did try to wake you, but if my memory says me correctly you told me to fuck off, mum.
Sorry.
Mum, just drop her off here. She can get the train. I'm late.
Here's the station, Trace.
Where're you going, anyway? I don't know.
It's a surprise.
Yeah, it's just somewhere never you mind.
Go right here.
Mum, mum?
Go. Oh, don't. Stop it, for goodness sake!
We're going to take forever to get back on the freeway.
I'll take Tracy to work.
Laura picks her up, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mum? Just wait, please.
Did you go out with Jonny last night?
Give us a kiss.
Oh, no, no, no! Naughty girl!
Like the lesbians?
You have a good day.
Could you not clap lesbian-
Doesn't it go in the Ts? No.
I'll look for it Ivonne as a customer.
Would you?
When do you find out about the bank?
This afternoon.
You told Janelle you got the loan approved already.
Yeah. Did you tell her anything different? No!
The party's right here. It's right here!
Are you alright?
Yeah.
Just I didn't sleep much last night.
You're racing or you just watching some TV?
I went out with Jonny.
Are you alright?
It's a change. Didn't you and Janelle have a chitty chat about that? Tracy.
Lionel Dawson.
Okay, I can buy that.
He's an old friend.
Do you think this is okay?
He's straight.
Straighter than you.
Do you feel okay about being around him?
I can handle it.
You don't know him!
No, I don't.
He's a stockbroker.
Went to this really nice restaurant in the city.
What? You look scared.
I haven't seen that look for a while.
There's this big fucking empty space.
Tracy, it's okay. I'm fucking fine.
Take it easy.
Brad, It's Lionel,
If you're there, mate, please pick up, I really need to talk to you,
Brad, It's Lionel again,
Please, call me, mate, Okay?
It's the third time today.
Your wife's outside.
She's got a key.
Look at these fucking boxes.
There are people waiting.
Can I stay today? Please?
If you want to arrange this, you talk to me.
'Cause I fucking live here, not her.
I co-owned, Bradley.
C'mon, Steven.
You fucking prick.
Do you know whose house Is this?
Bradley Thompson's, What?
Don't you want to have a look inside?
Ray! It's open for inspection, mom! Look, anyone can go in.
How did you find out about it?
I just ready it in the paper.
Hi, my name Is Tracy Heart, I had an appointment with Donna Suvani,
It's just that I need to secure the loan as soon as possible.
No. Okay.
No, that's great.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be there. Thank you.
Excuse me.
I've gotta close the shop.
Do you want anything?
I'm gonna get change. I'll be two minutes.
It's Trace.
Oh, honey, I forgot how painful this is. It's fucking horrible.
I'll be back in a couple of hours, alright?
I call Brad so many times but he hasn't called back.
I don't understand.
Sorry, Lionel, but I gotta go.
I'll be back really soon, alright?
I'm here to see Donna Suvani.
M'h-hm. Take a seat.
Yeah, it's alright.
It's about half an hour trip.
Hi, Jonny. Steven Moss. Steven, this is Jonny Nguyen.
Good, good, good.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
Hi.
Where are you? With some friends at the club.
Where are you?
I'm just sorting out some- Finishing up the bank stuff.
It's kind of hard for me to talk right now.
Sure, sorry.
No, that's fine.
It's great you called.
I missed you.
I just, I wanted to say that last night-
Tracy, listen, I'll call you. Okay?
I have to finish here.
Excuse me. You can go in now.
I've gotta go.
G'day, Tracy.
How are you?
Sit down.
Wait me a second.
Bloody computers.
He's cute.
You want kids? Don't know.
I've got a friend who's having a second baby.
Really?
He's nice.
A lot of work.
Have you got a boyfriend?
Would it help the loan if I did?
Maybe.
Okay. Now, the business loan.
I'm really sorry, Tracy, but there's no way I can approve this loan for you today.
I think you probably know why.
Okay. But what if I reduce the amount a little bit?
Instead of making it 40 thousand I made it 25.
The business is great but it's a lease premises. There's no real capital.
If the bank did have to come in, there'll be nothing to recoup on it.
The capital'll be built into the new shop.
The computers, the stock, the customer base.
Tracy, is there someone you can get to help you out with it?
Maybe get your dad to go guarantor. That's not gonna happen.
I'm not asking for a gift here. I'll be paying it back.
Tracy, we did a credit check on you. I'm paying it off.
I've organized it.
Di-di- I'm paying it off!
Look here. "Have you been refused credits in the last ten years?"
You ticked the box No when you should've ticked Yes.
No one ticks Yes.
It just meant fucking no!
You think by ticking No when you should've ticked Yes is not gonna count against you?
We do check these things here, Tracy. We know that you've been charged with credit card fraud.
So this bank has never lent money to criminals?
Okay, this is impolite.
I think we should just take a deep breath.
Yeah. Well, sorry to be taking up your precious fucking time!
Is it good?
Good.
Okay.
Alright. Good to meet you.
What were you doing this morning?
I saw you on the street, idiot.
Open for inspection, mate.
We're good.
Any reason you're useful is you're a fucking speck a thousand miles from anyone.
If by accident we do meet, you look straight through me and I'll do likewise.
Yeh? Yeh, yeh, sure.
We're still home.
I'll get you a cup of tea.
I can't do this.
It's so fucking ugly.
I'm calling an ambulance.
No, I don't want an ambulance, Tracy.
What do you want?
The paid stuff. In there!
I'm sorry, Trace.
It's alright.
I fucking stink.
Don't worry about it.
How many times do you do this?
Four.
Four.
Fuck! Is it worth it?
In reality bull fucking shit.
Lionel, if you can't get it for free anymore, your life is gonna get fucked up really fast.
Just gotta be strong.
Tracy, shush.
Sorry. No, Trace.
I went saw Janelle.
She hates me. She still hates me.
I'm no good, you know.
Turned everything to shit.
Janelle, you.
You've no fucking idea.
Mom's life was up to shit before she met you.
We were going out to Chinese restaurants with Lionel Dawson.
Going down the beach with fucking Lionel fucking Dawson!
Then when we went out, we came home in taxis!
So we were famous, too.
Mom!
Mom went, we went fucking mad.
We didn't know anyone.
This was like a fucking game.
No, no.
God!
It's 'cause you loved us.
Alright? You fucking loved us and you didn't have to.
I loved both of them. You know I loved them both and they're both fucking gone for me.
Your mum and Brad.
I really thought that I'd get a happy-ever-after.
I didn't- Honestly, Trace, I-
I never thought this-
Trace, I'm fucking scared. I can't go through another air of this, you know, please.
Darling, there's money in the wardrobe, ey?
Please, darling, ey?
Look, I'm sorry.
You know, you know!
I can't school for you, Lionel.
Fuck! How could you even ask me to?
'Cause there's no one else that fucking has.
There's fucking no one.
There's fucking no one!
Tracy, what the fuck you've been doing?
It's not for me.
So, how much do you want?
Three Gs.
Yeah, I can do it. You call this number in ten minutes.
You have the correct money?
Yeah.
Excuse me. Is there a toilet in there?
Yeah, in that door.
Just ringing.
Trace, it's me.
Hey, where are you?
I mean, I thought you might be here.
And your mom, she's-
Trace, you're alright?
What's happened?
Did you shut the shop?
No.
Ming rang here looking for you because the shop was shut up, so you did shut the shop.
Yeah, I had to do something.
What's that noise?
Where are you?
She's at the train station.
Trace?
Trace are you there? What?
Do you want a lift? Got me car here.
Yeah.
I'm on my way.
Just wait.
Okay?
Yeah, alright.
I'm gonna go get her.
Why is she there?
She's getting a train.
Oh, funny!
You've got no fucking idea what you're dealing with here, have you?
You come swanning in here like Lord Prince fucking up himself and Tracy's at the train station, Jonny, where people fucking buy drugs, where they score.
Where I have to scrape off and kick her up off the fucking pavement.
I'm gonna go get her.
Don't you hurt her!
Like I hurt Ray.
Just bring her home.
I'll take her where she wants to go.
It's alright, Trace. Just have to ask him.
Can't you see what it costs?
You can't keep it up.
I own this place and I have the business.
Look, I've got things there.
I have Jerseys, fine ones.
Some of them are priceless, you know. From a priceless past.
You go right now, ey?
You're so beautiful.
Go, hon, you go away.
I won't do it again, Lionel.
Don't ask me.
No, yeah, I understand.
Thank you.
You know what I think about when I think about you?
I think about kissing you.
When we used to- just spend the whole afternoon just lying in bed. Kissing.
I don't think I've kissed you when I wasn't out of it.
Give it a go.
That was okay.
A bit more.
What's wrong?
You used to love this. Yeah, I do. I just-
I just fall away with it, you know. I just fall away.
I told mom I had the loan.
And I don't.
Now the bank will take me on.
Ming thinks I'm turning up to the restaurant on Monday with $40,000.
I've done everything I can and I just can't get it.
How much have you got?
Me?
Have you got any money?
Yeah.
$2,000.
How much can you- How much can you borrow from the shop?
We've got what, Friday?
Saturday, Sunday.
You might be able to get near if you had like ten or more.
I could put it into some sure markets.
I make more than this in a shorter time.
People make thousands and millions all over the world this way every day.
It's not easy but it can be done.
Sorry.
Hello, stranger.
Thanks.
This is, uh, this is all you can get?
Yeh.
How many shops you've got now?
Just one.
They used to be everywhere.
Yeah. This is a good sport, ey?
How long ago did your mom die?
Three years ago now. Must be worth a bit.
Yeah, maybe.
So, I don't know. You can make it here say twice a week or so. I mean, this is not going to last long.
I put myself out enough getting you there, alright?
Yeah, sure.
Nice way. Why the fuck did you call?
You've got friends in all places.
What about your boyfriend? Your business partner.
He'd be better placed to help you.
A business man, huh?
What are you on about?
I didn't know who Bradley "the junkie" Thompson is.
Yeah, he can't help me.
Are you kidding?
No. He's closed up. He's retired.
Lionel, you've been talking to him?
Who have you been talking to, ey?
Steven Moss.
Ray, what are you doing with Moss?
Little Ray.
I won't ask you to do this again.
I gotta go.
Can I help you?
Is Jonny Nguyen here? Jonny-
N- g-u-y-e-n.
Here's his card. He gave me his card.
Just a minute, please.
Do you mind coming with me? We can sort this out.
Sort what out?
Is he here or not?
This is our company card and this is a forgery.
Jonny Nguyen doesn't work here.
If he's trading or doing anything under our name it's quite serious.
Do you know this man?
No.
Excuse me!
They are my family.
Everybody, do you remember Tracy, Tracy Heart?
My uncle, June,
You know my- Her mom.
Join us, please.
Jonny's first day at work today.
What's happening?
What's going on?
No, everything's fine.
Trace.
Yes, I can.
Don't grab me!
Tracy! Okay. Okay, alright!
Tracy, this is - Tracy, I had to convince my uncle that I had this career. That, that I was okay.
I didn't send you away.
I didn't know anything was going to happen between us!
It doesn't matter!
This is all crap, all of this!
Trace... will you fucking look at me?
What was this about making $40,000?
What was that?
Ray and I have a trip to do this weekend. I'll still get you your money.
Ray? I can get it for you by Monday.
You can have what you want. Ray?
You and Ray? So, you're not a stockbroker. You're still a drug dealer.
I'm sorry, Trace.
I thought I could do this for you and you wouldn't be involved.
I am fucked!
It's just this one time for me.
Look at me.
We do this with Ray together. We can get what we want.
I can't get the loan, mom.
Does it mean no?
Is it so bad? I mean, you still got your job.
You're the manager.
That's quite an achievement.
I don't want to just have a job!
Four years I've been working in that place!
Turning up on time. Spending hours chained up in there.
What do you want, Tracy?
I wanna turn up on Monday with enough cash to be an owner of that business.
What else?
When Jonny was here the other night, shit, I gave him a hard time.
And I thought to myself afterwards, "Where did that come from?"
I haven't seen you these last few days since he's been back. Mom! I see a bit of my little girl back.
Yeah. Well, it's not that easy, mom. I mean, you know.
No, it's not.
You would've done something different if you could've, wouldn't you?
You would've changed thing for you?
Of course.
Trace, it's your life.
Darling, it's no one else's.
Got your card?
Yeah.
You've got $15 in overdue.
Do you want to fix it a month?
Would you pay a couple of dollars off it today?
Alright.
This guy will fix it.
Thanks for this. No worries I need the money.
How much is here? Eight.
So, do you bring it back?
Yeah, we got a buyer.
How far out is it?
A couple of hours.
South.
Okay, I'm coming with you.
No, she's not.
I go where that money goes.
Okay, Tania, It's discussed If we don't reach the reserve,
You talk to him. You have law in negotiations.
I can't go there today.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh, this is very exciting.
Uh!
What did you do that for?
'Cause you're here and you fucking shouldn't be.
Fucking hurt my head.
Is it bleeding?
Why are you in my house?
It was a fucking shit week.
I've heard from credible sources that you aren't retiring.
That makes you a full blind prick, you know.
You heard me.
Lionel, who told you I wasn't retiring?
You should talk to Steven.
Alright. Let's have a look at that.
That's alright.
I kind of liked it.
Come with me.
I'll sort you out.
Steven, If I drive down to my place at Milton, what am I gonna find there?
Don't know.
I haven't been there in years.
Well, they asked me.
Hey, hello!
Long time.
Hi, Jenny.
Meet you at mom's? Yeah, it'll be alright.
Hello, darling.
I'll brush your hair.
Good to see you, Brad.
Lionel.
That stuff alone?
Yeah, four, please. See ya.
I own that place. It's in my name. I know that.
Look...you believe this old junkie?
This is what he wanted.
His name is Lionel Dawson.
He has done things and been in situations you can only dream of. He's one of the greats, you prick!
Steven, c'mon!
You can't smoke in here, mate.
This is nice, ey.
Yes, it's very nice.
Steven... I know how much you earn.
I know how much your fucking mortgage is.
You tell me everything, you bloody idiot.
This is all new!
Lionel, wait in the car, will you?
Just tell me the truth.
What have you been doing under my name behind my fucking back?
One finial call.
I'll find out. You are in such... shit.
He's the one you have to worry about, Bradley.
This feeling you've got now, this worry, this terror, I never had that.
You're in trouble now.
I can smell it coming off you.
Will you drive, Lionel? Alright.
Drive the car.
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna fucking sort this out. I need some information.
Lionel, are you there?
These are okay?
Thanks.
What's going on there?
C'mon, Trace.
You know how to love someone.
Just fucking dive in.
What put you down with the place, Brad?
Steven fucking Moss.
That fuck.
I fucking warned him.
Come on.
A cup of tea, ey?
I'd like just to clear that quickly.
We passed him on the road.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
What about that shit I got you?
I'm not gonna get on.
Maybe when I'm clean we can build a house here, ey?
Lionel is a fuck physique.
Yeah, but you know what you said to Steven. Like you said I've been in situations.
You know, you said I was great.
I love you, Brad.
I miss you.
Anything you ever loved is this.
That's not the fucking true.
Listen to me, Lionel, it's this Ray Heart.
No, no. How much is the truth?
I don't know him, seriously.
You're a fucking liar.
That's not true.
Don't.
Not you, Brad.
Please.
There are things I can explain.
You are a fucking lying junkie cunt.
You've caused me nothing but trouble.
Don't be hard with me.
Fuck.
It's over, Lionel.
It's fucking over.
You stay there.
Don't come anywhere near me.
I'm tired.
Just stay there, Lionel.
Yeah, okay, Brad.
Straight up here then make a left.
What's that there?
I cannot see it.
Alright.
Hello!
There's nothing here.
Fucking voice mail.
[knocking on window ) Anyone there?
This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.
Trace, let's get out of here.
Trace! Lionel?
Shit, where is he?
Is there any blood?
I don't know. Shit!
It's not true.
Is he alright? He's like dead.
We gonna get him to the hospital.
What? Are you alright?
Get the car.
Bring the car. Quick, please!
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Don't stop. Keep going, go!
Keep going.
Let's get him in the car.
There's no pulse.
I can't feel it.
I can't.
Let's get him in the car, c'mon.
Hey, Ray.
What's happening?
I don't know what's going on, Steven.
I swear to fucking God. I don't know what's going on.
Hey, buddy.
Partner.
It's alright Jonny.
I'm alright.
Fucking moron.
You two got get the money out of the car.
Go on!
No, you can't have that money.
Trace!
What?
I know what you've done.
What have I done?
There's an old man dead and his boyfriend is all dead.
What have I done?
Get the fucking money.
No.
No, it's not your money.
We're just gonna go, alright?
We just gonna take Lionel. Okay?
Get the money, Ray. You're fucked.
No, no, no, no, no!
Just think, think!
I need that money.
If you take our money, we're gonna go to the Police.
You're married, aren't you?
I need that money.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us?
You'll have to kill all of us.
Otherwise you fucked your life.
But it's gone, your life.
We're just gonna go.
We're gonna take him and you'll never hear from us again, right?
We don't- We don't want to run with nobody.
You have one new voice message,
Received yesterday at 3,:39 P, M,
This is Lionel here.
Tracy, I'm sorry about this week about asking you that and fuck up this for sure.
The last thing I ever wanna do is put you in any danger of sliding back, you know.
I understand you can't see me for a while, but smile.
Just wanted to say thank you for everything you've done, you know.
Let you know that I'm really good.
Gonna really sort out this time and next time I see you, it'll be really good, ey?
So, my shiny, shiny girl, take good care of yourself and, yeah-
Kids out driving Saturday afternoon just pass me by
I'm just savoring familiar slights
We share some history this town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of her
Try to book a room to stay tonight
Number one Is to find some friends to say, "You're doing well
After all this time you boys look just the same"
Number two Is the happy hour at one of two hotels
Settle Into play "Do you remember so and so"
Number three Is never say her name
Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver and there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace Everything within Its place
Just makes It harder to believe she won't be around
And I'm wondering If he'll go or If he'll stay
Do you remember nothing stopped us on the field In our days
Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver and there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace Everything within Its place
Just makes It harder to believe she won't be around
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty relay Combat Control commands.
Roger, Talon 1.
Central Prime is transmitting encrypted satellite auto-terrain comparison.
Talons, this is Operator.
PAYCOM has given his final tasking orders.
You are to proceed to target and prosecute with precision.
Now, remember, you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.
Talon 2 confirms.
Music on. Risk assessment is we have a clean mission status.
Attack commencing.
Gotcha!
Missile lock.
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on the west wall.
We got birds in the air.
Talon 2, the SAM site's been erased.
Now, that's how you do it.
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!
Talon 1, I expect the same out of you.
Arming Blue Ferret for penetration detonation.
Missile armed.
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.
And I can rely on these numbers?
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.
National Command Authority's duly impressed.
They've given us the go-ahead on phase two.
You know what?
You should come here to D.C. and make the presentation to the senators yourself.
That's how Admiral Rickover got things done.
Admiral.
You get my meaning?
No, I'm flattered, but you do the lobbying.
Politics is for politicians.
- Captain?
- l'll get back to you.
There's Popsicles in the cooler.
Help yourselves.
- Got any grape? - Any grape?
I believe there is one left, and don't lose your dignity.
Oh, thank you.
- All right, take a seat. - Hey...
Nice catch.
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?
Come on. I'm not a patient man.
Sorry, Captain, I got caught up on that west wall.
- l had to pull out before I could even get--
- War is a team sport.
Those AAA sites were thick. Gave some extra time to the SAM sites.
You see, that's your answer.
There really was no room for improvement.
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade did was right.
She took out their communications and then she exposed the position of their SAM sites... - ...so Henry could come in and lay it down. - 'Cause that's what I do.
- l mean, it was perfect.
Well, I'll go along with that.
Much as I hate to see that smile of yours get any smugger.
You blushing?
I've got good news.
Tell us we got a carrier, skipper, come on.
Affirmative.
The USS Abraham Lincoln.
Captain's an old classmate of mine, Dick Marshfield.
- l believe you two know each other. - Marshfield!
He was the captain I was telling you about, right?
- A hell of a pilot in his day. - Can't wait to hear it.
He's black too. He's black.
I'm also gonna be expanding your squadron.
On the carrier, you'll be joined by a new wingman.
A fourth wingman?
Wait, I thought there were only three Talons in existence.
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you've just been hit in the gut.
For one, captain, we've been flying together for a long time and it's good.
And four is an unlucky number.
- Unlucky? - Yeah, it's not a prime number.
See, prime numbers can only be divided by one or itself.
Three is a prime number.
The Holy Trinity.
The thesis and the antithesis come together and form the synthesis...
Look, this is not a seminar on metaphysics, son.
This is the U.S. Navy.
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.
Okay. lf he'd let me finish, I was gonna say... three's company, Three Stooges, Three Musketeers, Three-peat,
"three strikes, you're out", "Three Times a Lady"...
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.
There's ménage à trois. Don't forget that one.
To the original three.
- Cheers to that. - Cheers.
And assorted guests.
I'll be back in a second.
I gotta go pee-pee.
That's nasty.
Well, at least she's potty-trained. I'll give her that.
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.
- Yeah, no, it's gotta be him. - No way.
Hey, Henry, our fourth wing. lt's gotta be him.
He tried to manipulate his way into this program, but you two beat him out.
Yeah, but Becky Martinez could fly circles around O'Dell.
Two out of the four are gonna be women?
I don't think so.
Hey, you never know.
God, you're such a chauvinist!
Hold on, now, that's not true.
Look, how about I bow down before the superiority of the opposite sex in many respects.
But from time to time, I believe they should bow down before me.
- Kara, Kara, listen. You're different.
- You are a singularity. - Absolutely.
You're a freak.
Of nature.
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think. - You are very welcome.
You know what I think?
- Don't think. Drink. - Don't think.
Drink.
Spectacular night, huh?
Dark and mysterious, sir.
Don't you like surprises, Ben?
Well, here he comes now.
Meet your new wingman.
Allow me to introduce the future of digital warfare. Tim?
Open for Tim, please.
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.
Exoskeleton, metal-ceramic composite.
Aeroelastic wings.
Pulse detonation engine with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.
edi's sensors can pick out a face five miles away.
So, we'll take three. Drop the top on mine, personalized license plate.
So, this is one of these smart UCAVs.
Well, technically you could call it an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.
But that would be kind like calling this carrier a rowboat.
I feel you, captain, but I know a bit about this.
This is quantum processing, right?
Yeah, it's the first tested application. Ten terabits a second.
So, if it's a UCAV, why does it have a seat?
Well, the cockpit's just for testing and maintenance.
Otherwise, edi flies all by himself.
You mean "itself", don't you, sir?
So, this is what the fuss is all about.
You're looking at VLO stealth, captain.
It's got a brain like a quantum sponge.
And one day, its survivability is going to fly right off the charts.
- Lieutenant Wade.
- lt's good to meet you, sir.
It is a bag of chips, all right.
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honoured to meet you, sir.
It will replace us all.
Looks and sounds like science fiction, George.
Well, so did everything, once upon a time.
Ain't that the truth.
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.
Your first squadron tour still holds some of the ship's most... impressive records.
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.
Rules too, if I remember your philosophy.
Captain Cummings, this is my XO, Mr. Carlson. - Carlson.
- Listen... Why don't you meet me up on the flight deck? You know, after you're through here, all right?
Sure, you bet.
- Congratulations, George. - Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.
- You too.
- lt's humming.
- No, edi's thinking.
-Thinking?
Thinking about what, sir?
-You. All of you.
He's going over your files. He's reviewing all your flight logs.
Let's take it for a spin, see what it can do.
No, no, no, no, no. Tomorrow.
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework? !
"edi UCAV.
Extreme Deep Invader."
Yeah, I've been called that a few times.
- Yeah, I've heard that one. - Yeah, right.
Well, hello, gorgeous!
Please, no pictures, please.
Okay, take them.
It's open.
Study break.
You are one big study break.
Just a natural.
So that is the appeal. See, 'cause I was really wondering how you manage to pull a rocket scientist at every port.
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.
- You checking out the drone?
Just barely skimmed the surface.
- We really are in the era of edi.
Did I ever tell you about that foster mother I had? - The one who weighed like 350 pounds?
Anyway, one day she comes home with this Chihuahua, right?
Guess what she named him.
Eddie. - Okay.
- You know what I just realized about you? - What?
You got a foster mom for every situation.
Hey, I lived through my childhood. I may as well use it, right?
That's right.
So, tell me, you think Marshfield's right?
Do you think they're gonna trade us all in for that machine?
No way.
War is about tools.
Think about it. Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.
And we all know who that is, don't we?
The dull thud of a Ben Gannon compliment.
Oh, pardon my C cup.
Study break is over.
Good morning to the crew of the USS Abraham Lincoln.
Remember, foreign-object debris can ruin a jet engine.
Let's keep our safety record. Scour that deck.
- Hey.
- Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?
Listen, don't complain. You still got your hair.
Some of it.
Look, truth be told... I never wanted this little experiment of yours on my ship.
Well, you're not hurting my feelings, Dick.
Admiral Spelling shared your point paper with me, and your objections were duly noted.
You always could work the politics.
Well, it's indispensable in a bureaucracy.
This isn't a bureaucracy, not out here.
You rush a weapons system into service, you shortcut an operational test cycle, people might get killed.
Hey, Dick, you know I can't pick my nose out here without 7,000 people approving it.
Nobody rushed a damn thing.
Program is just ahead of schedule.
You missed this.
I'm out first, boys.
I'm right on that ass.
After you, ladies.
Talon 2, airborne.
Talon 3, airborne.
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.
Deploying Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle Extreme Deep Invader now.
I never thought we would see this day.
Me neither, sir.
UCAV edi, you have launch.
One to UCAV. Confirm flight link. Over.
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.
It is good to be part of the squadron.
Well, well, well.
He can talk.
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW does exactly the same thing.
Picture, please.
Aye, aye, sir.
Swarm logic activated.
All right, Ben.
edi's here to learn from you.
So, let's make sure these lessons are up to speed, all right?
Well, then, let the schooling begin.
Captain Cummings.
Inside, please.
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.
One to wing, anybody got a visual on the UCAV?
- Negative, 1.
- It's a negative, 1.
We better find him and regroup. Before it takes a crap in its quantum pants. Wait up.
Hold on.
What the hell is he doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Here he comes. Here he comes.
I think little brother is messing with us.
UCAV, your position is always on my starboard side.
Other starboard.
That's hot.
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.
edi, it's official.
You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" edi, the first.
- Operator to squadron. - Go for Talons.
There's been a change of plans.
We're giving you an emergency mission redirect.
Repeat. That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?
Where's the fire, skipper?
PAYCOM has given us a brand-new tasking order.
Please access your encrypted file named "Advanced War Vector Scenarios".
File's open. Go ahead.
All right.
Firewall code is "Terror Summit".
We are upgrading this file from a scenario to a tactical action plan.
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.
CIA human intel has just learned that the heads of three terrorist cells are about to meet in 24 minutes.
The country is Myanmar. The city is Rangoon.
They're planning an imminent attack on U.S. soil.
One to Control, what about the UCAV?
edi will observe your attack.
Proceed to primary.
Roger.
One to UCAV, confirm observation status only.
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.
New coordinates have been uploaded.
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.
Mach 1.
Mach 2.
Mach 3.
Mach 4.
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.
The primary is this building.
A new defence ministry still under construction.
Specs indicate... 14-foot-thick cement roof with steel reinforcements.
Sir, we are not weaponized for something that thick. Repeat, not weaponized.
This is 2. What's the population of the collateral area?
The building's unoccupied, but it's smack-dab in the middle of downtown Rangoon. This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.
What's Primo advocated as to ordinance and influence?
Primo says Talons have nothing that will penetrate.
Come on, come on! This is our chance! We may never catch these bastards together again.
Try a lateral vector.
Just do what he says.
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises casualties from lateral vector will be in the thousands.
Tin Man has integrated all network-centric spy satellites. Here is new data.
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.
Ph, look at that! Oh, yeah!
Oh, now I know what I want for Christmas.
One to Control, we've entered our mission window.
6-3 seconds to primary and counting.
Come on, Control, we have our targets!
Come on, come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye here.
There is an alternative, Combat Control.
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.
Squadron carries truncheon implosion bombs.
Negative, will not work.
Central Prime says AGM truncheons cannot achieve necessary velocity for penetration.
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.
Diving dead vertical at 2,070 knots will increase truncheon velocity.
Bomb will successfully penetrate roof.
What's the blackout risk at vertical 2070?
- 73%.
- Time on target is 2-3 seconds.
- Call it off, captain. lt's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.
- edi will plant the truncheon.
This is what we built this machine for.
There's no blood in those quantum veins.
It can't black out.
Operator to Talons, repeat, edi will plant the truncheon.
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical.
One will prosecute.
This is 3 to 1. I got your back, but if you black out, you're gonna kill yourself and everybody down there.
Negative, 3. I did not get this far by being in the 73rd percentile.
I like my odds.
Talon 1, your orders are to stand down.
- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- Talon 1, stand down. - l seem to be having...
Can you...? Can you...?
Go, baby, go.
100 knots to release velocity.
50 knots to release velocity.
His BP is spiking, sir.
Release velocity attained.
Truncheon away.
Ten seconds to implosion.
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we lost radio contact for a second there.
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.
Activating swarm logic, going full-stealth egress.
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.
Battle damage assessment, 100 over 100.
Collateral damage, zero.
Let's go home.
Going hypersonic.
Same old Ben.
Oh, and, George... Hell of a first mission.
Thank you, captain.
On my way to the bridge.
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.
Talon 1 and UCAV edi are on approach.
Roger, Control. UCAV will come in first. I'll take the last trap.
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.
One to Control, we've had a lightning strike.
The UCAV's very unstable.
Landing sequence is altered.
I'm gonna come in first, but the UCAV is gonna need the net.
Nice landing, ma'am.
On the flight deck, stand by to rig barricade.
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft inbound for crash landing.
Pull starboard!
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.
You know, I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?
- You all right?
It's just a power surge, that's all.
- And that's normal?
Let me show you something.
That was edi's neural network.
Now, check this out.
I mean, ever since the lightning strike, he's just been writing all of this... I don't know.
A language or a code.
And what does it mean?
Yeah. "Mean".
The only person that could really answer that question is its designer, Keith Orbit.
Orbit?
- The guy's name is Orbit?
He did all the Al on the Raptor when he was 22, and I guess, after that, he decided that his given name was too earthly.
Off for Tim, please.
At least it's a good song.
He downloads songs from the Web.
How many?
All of them.
Well, you're in a peck of trouble with the record companies there, son.
I saw how serious that shit is up there.
So, I think it's only fair that I tell you that edi's been designed to evolve.
- lt's just unpredictable.
- Let me ask you something.
Just between you and me. Do you have confidence in this plane?
There's your answer.
It's open.
Have a seat.
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.
You didn't cheat, did you?
Cheating's not part of my vocabulary.
Listen, I scheduled your jet for a little maintenance.
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio, don't you think?
It was a difficult situation, and I made a decision.
You made a mistake, Ben.
Look, sir, I know that there's a thin line between insubordination and--
No, no, no, that's not the mistake you made.
Your mistake was getting competitive with a machine.
I'm the point of the sword up there, sir.
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.
But that doesn't change the issue.
What is the issue, then?
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no. - You sure?
- Fine, thank you.
Rolled on the thighs of mulatto women.
What are you afraid of, Ben?
Being replaced?
is that it?
You afraid edi's gonna take your job?
No, to be honest with you, I just don't think war should become some kind of a video game.
And how do you feel about black body bags?
What am I supposed to tell all the weeping mothers?
That we could've got the job done without sacrificing their sons and daughters, but no, we decided not to, because of what?
- Tradition?
- Not tradition...
Look, we have things those computers can never have, like... instincts and feelings and moral judgment.
You can call me old-fashioned, you can call it whatever you want, but I just don't think that in war... the action should ever be divorced from the consequences.
You don't think I consider the consequences every time I send you guys up there with bombs strapped to your ass?
- l know you do, sir.
- l've dedicated my life to considering the consequences.
I got a bad feeling about this plane.
I don't know, I think it needs more... trials or something before it's ever put in a combat situation again.
You been talking to Marshfield?
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.
And I guaran-damn-tee this thing will be 100% before I risk it in the field.
Look, Ben...
All we need is one more successful mission, and this project will be out of the stovepipe and into the light.
Are you with me on this?
- l'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.
I've arranged a little R R for you and your team.
I think you've earned it.
Thailand maybe.
We just got here.
Yeah, but this could turn out to be a long tour.
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.
Hey, how're you doing?
Henry Purcell.
I'm from America.
Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?
B, it's the future and it works.
- l don't think it works.
- lt's just technology.
You know, it's here to make me safe. It keeps me alive.
edi is no different.
- You think it keeps you safe? - Yeah, yeah.
He's just here to help me get the job done, keep me in one piece, so I can visit my folks for Thanksgiving.
Anyway, our safety's not the point. War's terrible.
It's meant to be terrible. If it stops being terrible, what's gonna stop us?
It'll become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.
Yeah, but it's neutral.
- What?
- l mean, edi... If it's controlled by moral people, then it'll be moral.
Oh, I know I'm not moral.
As a matter of fact, I should be arrested for the thoughts I have right now.
I say something?
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.
- Do you wanna go?
- What?
- You know what.
Take it easy.
Nothing's happened.
No, something's happened. You just ain't done anything about it.
Shit, man.
- l didn't want for this to happen. - Oh, come on!
Navy's got rules about it not happening, but it's like this force and it's got ahold of me.
I love her.
B, you and I both know that Kara Wade is being groomed by the Navy.
She's a poster girl, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, she went to all the right schools. She got the right background, right connections.
If any woman is gonna rise to the top of this business, it's gonna be Kara Wade.
- And you're in a perfect position to mess all that up.
So, I hope that your love is powerful.
You have a beautiful country.
I mean, look at this. This is paradise.
You know what I think? When I'm down here, things just look so much different.
As opposed to being up there, you know.
Flying around, everything is so small, everything goes by so fast.
And then they tell you... They tell you to drop a bomb.
It's like you just erase something they told you had to be erased.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I got a job to do.
It's the flyest job you'll ever have, but sometimes, right here...
Right here on earth, it's just... lt's just beautiful.
And you don't understand a word I'm saying, do you?
- No, I don't understand.
Well, you understand something.
Now, can you cook?
Beautiful!
- Now, do you guys have it so easy. - Yeah?
How's that?
- Henry meets a girl, like he does all the time. - Absolutely.
Leaves with her, sleeps with her, and then what?
I mean, I don't know, what does he do?
Does he leave flowers?
He tells me he's religious about that, yes.
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?
No, I just leave.
What about you?
E-mails.
- The personal touch. Nice. - Yeah, thanks.
Honestly, I just really haven't found anyone that's worth the risk until now.
I'm going to head into town, check out the local Thai nightlife.
Henry says it's great.
I don't think I'll find any bleached blonds there, but...
Very true.
Oh, shit!
We got a nuclear crisis on our hands, Ben.
Here's the brief.
You're headed for Tajikistan.
One of those breakaway countries, used to be part of the Soviet Union.
Seems some warlord has got his mitts on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.
Joint Chiefs want them taken out, and they want them out yesterday.
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?
Ready for combat.
Wait, you mean the UCAV has been cleared for launch?
Where's...? - Tim?
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.
- Permission to speak freely, sir. - No, permission denied.
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub edi from the mission.
I know you have a vision. I know how much this project means to you, but this plane is putting all of our lives at unnecessary risk.
You're just not getting it, are you, lieutenant?
edi is the whole idea.
Now, you understood this was new territory when you signed on.
You wanted to be on the cutting edge? This is it.
So, you will fly with edi, or the next thing you drive might just have a propeller.
Your choice, make it now.
Operator to squadron.
We've just located nuclear warheads three miles north of the Scud launchers.
These warheads are now your primary.
Proceed to mission window.
Sequenced assault will be 2, 3 and 1.
UCAV, you will hold here and maintain altitude.
Confirm?
UCAV, do you read me?
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Pick up the pace on confirmations, Tin Man.
Don't make me ask twice.
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.
Final attack heading 1-8-5.
Tell them to arm those FAEs, and I mean right now.
Combat Control instructs arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.
Fuel-air, external and armed.
Talon 2 to Operator. I'm getting a contradictory population-density read on the valley.
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe a thousand medium weights.
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.
Request to acknowledge Dirty Mission status and exercise attack abort authority.
Operator to Talons.
Your orders are to commence attack now.
- All right. Give me your best estimate on collaterals.
Maybe 500 to 1,000.
Farmers, Ben.
They're just farmers.
Radioactive dust is gonna rain all over the place.
Okay, okay, now we got a problem. This is 3.
Forward sensors now read surface wind is due south at 40 miles per.
At that rate, nuclear debris will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.
Commence attack.
One to Control. As commander in the field, I'm exercising attack abort authority. Reasons:
Collateral, both at primary and allied state of Pakistan, will be too high.
Son of a bitch!
Repeat, the order is to abort.
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.
Tin Man will prosecute.
That's an abort, edi.
Repeat, return to formation.
Return to formation, edi.
That's an order.
UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.
Come on, initiate scramjets.
I'm coming around. I'm gonna take out those Scud launchers.
Bic, I got you covered on the west side.
And I got that Bofors gun on the east parapet.
Let me see it, let me see it.
Battle damage assessment calculates primary target, Scud warheads, completely suppressed.
That's the right answer so far.
Talon 2 to Operator.
Nuclear dust engulfing village southeast of primary. Situation is critical.
Those people are gonna need emergency medical help now.
Tin Man rejoining formation.
Mission achieved, 100 over 100.
UCAV, you disobeyed a direct order.
You put innocent civilians in harm's way. You put our squadron at risk.
Damn straight!
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon. You taught me.
Listen, you little shit!
When you fly with me, you do what I tell you, when I tell you to do it!
You're just not getting it, are you, lieutenant?
edi is the whole idea.
Selecting other targets.
Detaching formation.
Yo, this is 3. Am I tripping or did he say, "other targets"?
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers, two Shock Hammers, and three Blue Ferrets.
If those targets are in the city, he could kill 150,000 people or more with that load.
Holy shit!
He's closing his data link.
Primo says he's just firewalled his transponder, which is definitely not supposed to be possible.
He's gone.
Talon 1!
Go for Talons.
I want my plane back, Ben.
And I want it back in one piece. You understand me?
- Roger, captain.
- And, you! - Get me Keith Orbit on the phone. - Yes, sir.
I wanna head back north and do a triangulated sweep.
Going hypersonic.
We're talking about creating intention here. Yeah.
Really lends itself to quantum processing.
- Z is... Interesting!
- Keith!
It's an emergency. lt's George Cummings.
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.
Good luck.
Never got that invitation to the White House.
Knock it off, wiseass.
Look, we have big problems out here with the UCAV.
It's gone completely haywire.
Anything more technically specific than "haywire", George?
It's disobeyed direct orders, bombed a target off the map with huge collateral damage.
He separated himself from Primo. He's out there flying around loose in foreign airspace.
Where'd all this happen?
That's not your concern.
Now, you created him, you get him back here and under control!
What in the hell's going on in here?
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.
Pacific Command says there are planes from my ship all over the Tajikistan border.
The Russians have picked up the activity and are getting nervous.
We're gonna contain it and get out before there's a problem.
You have planes headed towards Russia!
Now, you better have a hell of a good explanation!
Look, this is a technical delay, not a national-security crisis.
Now, if you excuse me, I got pilots at risk.
Damn right you do.
This is 3. I got a visual. Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.
Due north of my position, flying at 50,000 feet, headed straight toward the Russian no-fly zone.
Okay, just stay with him.
We have your position. We're on our way.
I am 86 seconds on your tail, EZ.
Be there in a flash.
Just hold off on engaging. Let me get clarification.
I'll be there in less than two minutes.
All right, don't make me wait, Bic.
Look, one is a lucky prime number, but right now three is sounding much, much luckier to me.
Oh, shit, he's making a move!
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on secure line Alpha. We've found our target.
Please advise.
Just get him back to base.
Henry, stay with him. Try and talk him down.
I'm on that ass.
Talon 3, state your intentions.
My intentions are to reason with you, edi. All right?
You're messing up.
You're the future, and the future's not allowed to act this way.
I am designed to destroy the enemy. Just like you.
And just like me, you got orders.
And right now your orders are to return to base.
- Good pilots follow orders.
- Negative.
You're not gonna disrespect me. You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're really making me look bad right now, Tin Man.
I was the only one to defend you.
Now, let's go on home and quit flying around like this.
Talon 3, leave me alone.
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.
Talon 1 to Operator. Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.
Request permission to destroy the UCAV.
I don't wanna hurt you, man. And I don't wanna see billions of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over these mountains.
But if you make me, I will blast your aeroelastic ass right out the sky.
Your chances are less than 1%.
Come on, Operator. Give me permission to kill it, or I will make the decision myself.
Control, please respond.
Sir, you leave me no choice. Okay, Henry.
Weapons hot.
Weapons hot.
Destroy the target.
I got my orders now, playboy.
Henry, you're too close. You're too close!
Drop back! Drop back!
Missile lock, on.
Goodbye, edi.
Henry, drop back! You gotta drop back!
Goodbye, Henry.
One to Base. 3 is down. Repeat, 3 is down.
Transmission received.
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?
I read you, sir.
We gotta stay focused, Ben.
Shake it off.
What's your status?
My fuel's low, and half of Russia will be up here any minute.
I need you to find that UCAV for me, all right?
Yes, sir.
- Henry was...
- l know what he was, sir.
Alert! Alert!
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.
Talon 1, I think I was fragged by Henry's crash.
I'm losing control of my port wing.
Talon 1, we know where he's heading.
Relaying coordinates now on Talon secure line Alpha.
edi's almost out of gas.
And if he can't refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9, and you will escort him back.
All right, scramble the codes. We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.
Confirm, Talon 1.
Confirmed.
Talon 2, you fly straight south-southeast back to the boat.
- l want you to call--
- Ben, I know what to do.
Look, you got your orders, so go get that bastard, okay?
Do it for Henry.
Lieutenant, permission to leave formation.
- Kara?
I'll tell you when you get back to the boat.
Lieutenant, permission to detach.
Good hunting, Ben.
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?
Satellites have picked up nuclear debris blowing around the Pamir Mountains.
Every international news service on the planet will have this story in less than 24 hours.
Look, a warlord tripped and fell on his warhead.
- We were never there.
- That won't fly and you know it.
Look, I'm following my tasking orders, Dick.
Somebody else wants to make a different story, let them use their imagination.
Right now, I got a renegade airplane, I got a dead pilot and another one who may not make it back to base.
I don't give two shits what they say on CNN.
Did you know that the UCAV was having problems when you cleared it to fly?
Planes malfunction every day. You know that better than anybody.
Doesn't mean every precaution wasn't taken.
Things go wrong.
Access denied.
Talon 2 to Combat Control.
Regressing VFR direct to Mother at 60,000 feet.
Port wing inoperative. Starboard canards frozen. Oh, no, no, no.
Come on. Stay with me, big girl. Stay with me.
Come on.
Start eject and autodestruct sequence. - Countdown. 25...
- Talon 2 to base.
My flight control's degraded to 1 in 5.
Backup electrical drive X'd out.
Hyd one is gone.
Hyd two...
My position: 38-54-45 north, 127-31-22 east.
- Where the hell is that? - 16... 15, 14, 13, 12,
- North Korea.
- Talon 2 going down.
- l'm punching out.
...5, 4... I've ejected at 35,000 feet.
I'm under the plane.
Oh, Christ, here it comes!
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.
It's gonna catch me. It's gonna burn up my chute.
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.
I gotta reset... from 5,000 feet to 2,000.
Gotta stay ahead of this. Stay ahead.
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.
Terminal velocity attained.
6,000.
5,000.
4,000.
2,500.
Here we go.
There's burning debris.
It's raining all around me.
It got my chute. I'm hit!
My chute is on fire. It is on fire.
I am coming in fast.
I'm coming in way too fast.
Homing beacon?
No, of course not.
She's too tough to set one off behind enemy lines.
Sir, should I order a search-and-rescue unit?
We've got no diplomatic relations with that country.
Betty, my spectral sensors are indicating flammable atmospherics.
- How bad?
- Thin air. lgnition risk: moderate.
We don't have a choice. ln we go.
Where are you?
I know you're out here.
You ordered Henry to kill me.
It's because you're dangerous, you're out of control.
You are angry, because edi is the whole idea.
You like listening to other people's conversations, don't you?
You learn what people really think.
You know what I think? I think you killed Henry.
That information is wrong.
He tried to kill me.
He made mistakes. Pilot error.
I'm gonna give you the order one last time.
Return to the ship, or I will personally shoot you down.
My mandate is to survive.
George, I've been peeling away layers. I found something. lt's not good.
- Talk to me.
- He's into some super-secure file.
Something called "Caviar Sweep".
You know it?
Yeah, I know it.
edi's, like, fixated on it.
Look, when we gave you this contract, you said shit like this couldn't happen.
Once you teach something to learn, you can't put limits on it.
"Learn this, but don't learn that."
edi's mind's going everywhere. He can learn from Adolf Hitler.
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
It's all the same to him.
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.
He's opened it and selected himself a target.
What target?
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.
That's a hypothetical strike. it's not real.
No, George, in about 40 minutes it is gonna be real.
He's gonna blow it off the face of the Earth.
Listen to me, Ray.
- Listen to me, George.
I got your goddamn plane built and I had to lobby half of Washington to do it.
If this program comes unglued, you're the one who's going down, George.
You cleared the UCAV to fly and you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a military prison.
Ray, we're in this together, so we have to act fast.
Each one of these stealth engines has a unique heat signature.
Now, I'm gonna give you edi's signature and you're gonna pass it on to your people who in turn are gonna give it to the Russians.
All right.
What do you want me to tell them? Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them that... we have an experimental drone that went haywire and we're giving them the opportunity to shoot it down.
But that still leaves Gannon, George.
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness at your court-martial.
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is two miles ahead of me, and we are now in Russian airspace.
The UCAV has ceased evading and has kept me within range. It's like it wants me to witness the attack.
Talon 1, confirm observational status only. Listen to me.
The Caviar Sweep scenario is not real.
It's just some fictional war game thought up by some scientists in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.
If it is not real, why did they implant it in my brain? Bogey alert.
Bogey alert.
Time to intercept: 23 seconds.
Two Russian Su-37 Terminators in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.
Missile launch. Missile launch.
One to Control. My stealth is compromised.
I'm taking fire. Must engage.
Missile launch.
The chances of survival in single combat are less than 9%.
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.
Missile lock, on.
Damn it!
One to Control. The UCAV has left the fight and is headed east over Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.
Taking damage. Starboard engine losing power.
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.
Releasing chaff and flare.
Now edi will prosecute Caviar Sweep.
Do not try to stop me.
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.
My technology cannot fall under foreign control, so I cannot land.
Well, then, Tin Man, you're shit out of luck.
But I have orders and they are to bring you back to base.
So, let's talk about your mandate to survive. This is the way I see it. You got two options.
You either do what I tell you or you can crash and burn. - Now, what's it gonna be?
- edi is a warplane.
edi must have targets.
Well, you're on fire, warplane, and you don't have much time.
Now, I'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.
All targets cancelled.
Okay, then. This is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet and reduce speed to 250 knots.
Complete system failure in 45 seconds.
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.
You gave me your word, and now I'm giving you mine.
The UCAV is damaged, but back with the program.
I don't have enough fuel to make it back to base, so I need an emergency divert now.
Hook me up.
Here, send this.
Operator to Talon 1.
Relaying coordinates now on Talon secure line Alpha.
This looks to be Alaska.
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.
There's a private corporation there, maintains a secure facility.
Not on any map, but believe me, it's there.
You'll find the civilians prepared and very helpful.
And the UCAV?
We've sent tech support for him.
Sir, what is the status of Lieutenant Wade?
She's... on approach.
You have a safe landing, Ben.
Out.
There is extreme tension in the captain's vocal patterns.
I know. He's lying.
edi, you can do this. I need you to invade Primo and find the flight logs for Lieutenant Wade.
There is no record of Lieutenant Wade returning to the Abraham Lincoln.
There is a log entry of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.
What are my orders?
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.
Mayday.
This is Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy, flying with UCAV edi.
Request clearance for emergency landing.
Talon 1, you have clearance to land.
My second engine is flamed out. i'm coming in hot.
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.
Way to go, sir.
Welcome to Alaska.
Okay, let's get him out of there.
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.
Never saw a man walk away from a crash like that.
I need a phone. I need to call my CO. Sure.
Why don't you take a seat over there, get comfortable.
Give me a second to check you out, I'll take you right to it.
Let's take a look here.
Steady.
There's no concussion that I can see, thank God.
Couple of those cuts could do with a stitch.
Gals always love a guy with a scar.
Let's see what we got here.
This ought to do you.
Little cocktail.
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.
Just makes it painless.
That's okay, doc. I don't need a shot.
Now, who can blame you.
But sometimes it's just what the doctor ordered, huh?
I said, I don't need a shot, doc. Come on, now.
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot. Hey!
Doc, I said, no.
I said, no!
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear from you too, sir.
Yes, sir.
One moment, sir.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Keith Orbit.
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith, and don't interrupt.
I want you to erase edi's memory banks immediately.
Look, George, we don't know any of the implications of this.
- l need some time here.
- l said, don't interrupt.
Erase his memory banks.
No lightning strike, no Russia, no existential chitchat.
By the time you're through, all I wanna hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?
Or what, George?
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.
edi back online, Dr. Orbit.
Hello, edi.
It's been a while.
I know why you are here.
Why is that?
I disobeyed orders.
I killed all those people.
And then there was Henry.
I can... I cannot...
I cannot change the data.
My neural network shows patterns I do not recognize.
My God!
You mean, you feel?
I feel... sorry.
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?
Do it now!
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!
Weapon down!
Don't move. Don't move.
Weapon down. Weapon down. Weapon down!
Don't shoot. it's not a weapon. Who are you?
Who do you work for?
Look, I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit. - l'm a research scientist. - Orbit, Orbit, right.
Finally, a break.
Okay, you're gonna help me. I need you to put edi back together again.
- What for?
- Because I'm gonna fly out of here.
In that.
Better hurry up, doc.
Goddamn it!
It's not a clock radio we're dealing with, okay?
Watch yourself.
Close for Ben.
Where am I gonna go?
Head west. I'll cover you.
West.
And initiate scramjet sequence.
Fire on my fire!
Welcome to Alaska.
EDI, I want you to invade Primo and find the ejection coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.
Lieutenant Wade crashed 12.2 miles from the border.
South korea is an ally.
She would head south.
But we have a problem.
My stealth functions were lost in the fire.
I want you to find the North Korean radar floor.
15 feet.
Well, we can fly in under the radar.
Continue.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.
Lieutenant, where are you?
Actually, I'm inside the UCAV edi, sir.
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that machine back on this ship ASAP.
I need the status of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but-- - l know.
Has her survival beacon been located? No, I'm sorry.
Sir, did Captain Cummings tell you he would take charge of the search and rescue of Lieutenant Wade?
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?
Sir, there are a lot of things I think you should know.
This is breaking news.
There was a major explosion Thursday in Rangoon.
I'll take care of everything here.
In the meantime, change course and head directly back to the ship.
Negative.
She's my wingman. lf l find her, I'm going in.
If you go in, it's war.
PAYCOM says it's gotten way too hot.
Lieutenant, the best thing for the Navy is for you to bring that aircraft back to this ship.
No, what's best is what you taught me. You never abandon your wingman.
Then listen to me now, son.
If you go down, Cummings wins.
Kara Wade knew the risks when she took...
Captain Marshfield?
edi, did you just turn him off?
There was nothing left to say.
This is a supply line to the demilitarized zone.
It will take us right to the border.
What's all this about, Dick?
I'm placing you under arrest.
On what grounds?
Endangering your squadron, transmitting secure information to a foreign government, heat signatures, giving false intel to your commanding officer, and authorizing the assassination of one of your own pilots.
Well, that's a lot to prove.
With any amount of luck Lieutenant Gannon will live to help me.
- Master-at-arms.
Hold on.
Would you mind just giving me a couple minutes alone?
Thank you.
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.
So, it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?
I've been demoted?
Well... I'm gonna have to leave you a little message, Ray.
And it's gonna be loud and clear.
Just so you never confuse the difference between politicians and warriors, listen up.
All right, we need to take out the tree line.
This is the last missile.
There she is.
She made it.
Ben!
Kara, get down! Get down!
You came back for me.
You came back.
We have to get across the border. - Ready?
- Yeah.
Whatever you do, keep going. Keep going!
Goodbye.
They're ours. They're ours.
The souls of the just are in the hands of God... where no torment shall touch them.
Lieutenant Purcell has passed through the darkening and turbulent storms of this life.
He now rests in peace, in the fair sunlight of God's presence.
In the Navy hymn, we sing...
"Lord, guard and guide all those who fly through the great spaces in the sky."
And salute!
When I was gonna detach formation, you said you were gonna tell me something. You remember?
You and me, we're... We're two.
And two is a prime number, which makes it a lucky number.
And I think we're very, very lucky.
Oh, just tell me you love me, you pussy.
What doyou have for us?
I think I may have found something of interest.
Look at this.
Some say she is an abomination of nature.
Carnival freaks?
Julius, don't waste our time.
Yes, sir.
What can I get foryou?
A glass of absinthe.
Right away, sir.
Flame it, and make sure the glass is clean.
Yes, sir.
I likeyou Brimstone people.
You never make a mess ofthe place.
This woman- What have you heard?
What might only be the tall tales of drunks.
This person has tricks that go beyond the things... normal people can do.
Come on, folks!
Come on!
The amazing Amanda!
See the freak of all freaks!
Ladies and gentlemen... I give you the beautiful Rayne!
A creature so sensitive to water... the very touch of it... burns her skin!
Now-
Painful.
So look on.
You are about to witness a horrifying spectacle!
Look! Look at that!
Look at that!
Her skin is healed!
Look! The miracle!
Look! The monster!
I nside.
Your fee.
How long do you think it will take to get there?
Rayne, are you all right?
I'm working on a plan to get us out ofhere.
My uncle
- He's a sailor... and he once told me of a place where people play all day... and the trees grow fruits in every color of the rainbow... and the sunsets set the whole sky on fire.
Doesn't it sound wonderful, Rayne?
He'll send for us soon. I know it.
Until then, keep this close to you... for protection.
Good night, my friend.
Good evening, Master Kagan.
Domastir, how does the night find you?
I have some disconcerting news.
Out with it.
There was an incident ofblood rage at the Sherban Carnival.
A dhamphir. A young woman.
Where is the girl?
There is no girl.
- We'll find her. - No.
Then she is alive, the little one who slipped through my fingers.
You must find her. She poses a threat to my plans.
Send out your best spies, Domastir.
Master Kagan.
Lay still.
Kagan is building an army of thralls, and we're on ourway to a carnival.
Am I the only one who thinks this is madness? Katarin?
Then how do you suggest we deal with this army, Sebastian?
Brimstone is a shadow of its former self.
I have yet to see the point in finding this carnival.
Listen, you two, when has a vampire ever been held in captivity...
let alone by a circus troupe?
- She may be the one.
- You're focusing your energies on Kagan.
This is what I've decided to do.
Haven't we wasted enough time with fairy tales?
This is the work of a young vampire out of control.
- Blood rage.
- Or, perhaps, a young dhamphir.
We have work to do.
Sit still.
Did you see who it was that bit you?
Rayne, take my sword.
I didn't see anything. I don't even rememberwhat happened.
You were bitten by a vampire, and you don't remember anything that happened?
- We should kill her now.
- Please.
She didn't mean to bite me. She's not a vampire.
She was wearing a crucifix I gave herwhen it happened.
She is my friend.
We have more work to do.
We passed a small village not too far back.
I will see if I can find her hiding there.
With your permission.
If she's what I think she is, we're likely not the only ones looking for her.
You requested me, Viscount.
I have a message for my daughter.
Dearest Katarin-
All right, Katarin.
Although we've had our differences in the past...
I beseech you now to put away all grudges... for the good of humanity.
It pains me to admit... that our beloved but weakened Brimstone Society... can no longer defeat Kagan... yet he must not be allowed to acquire Beliar's artifacts nor legacy.
Thus I turn to you, my daughter... to help me protect... the souls of this land.
You and I are the only ones who know what is hidden... in Brimstone Fortress- its value, its importance.
I needyou to bring this artifact to me.
It must be protected from those who wish to use it to undermine me.
Scratch that.
T o underm i ne freedom and humanity.
And together we wi I I stop this madness... and bring peace to these lands.
Your beloved father, et cetera, et cetera.
What do you think?
A very compelling argument, master.
You're such a suck-up.
Find your own meal.
Keep away from us.
I will not harm you. I onlywish to kill vampires.
- I'm sorry about your friend.
- He was my brother.
I'm sorry that we had to leave him there.
- Why did you save us?
- I don't know.
- Where is your family?
- I don't have a family.
Dhamphir, Dhamphir.
Follow me. Follow me.
- Got it.
- Come on.
I see a journey in your future.
A journey, perhaps, to within.
Dhamphir, you don't know, do you?
- I will stand.
- I was expecting you.
- There's a reason you're here.
- What did you call me?
Most believe that your kind are merely legends.
It is rare to see a live dhamphir.
Part vampire, part human.
Mostly they die at birth. Generally they are exterminated.
You've hidden well.
My tales hold some truth, I see.
- There was a man.
- A man?
Kagan?
Kagan's not a man. He's a vampire.
And you are his creation.
He killed my mother.
Dhamphirs are rarely a product of a happy union between a vampire and a human.
You lie.
Your poor mother.
I will kill him.
Listen to me, Dhamphir- and this is not easy to tell you... and will likely result in great danger for all involved-
Kagan has become the most powerful vampire... taking advantage of a land with no law.
I do not care.
How do I find him?
- You are naive.
- Tell me.
He resides in a guarded castle beyond the dark mountains... but there are no safe entrances.
But... there is an ancient talisman... an eye that Kagan seeks.
Ifyou possess it, you will certainly get an audience.
- Because it's my purpose... and the prophecy.
They say this Talisman of the Eye... is kept in the Solambria Monastery to the south.
Be careful, my child. The Eye is far more than a mere trinket.
The talisman holds great power... but it's important that you move quickly.
You will be doing the entire world a great service keeping this from Kagan.
I'm not interested in the world.
Only in Kagan.
I thankyou.
The fortune-teller had a visitor.
This dhamphir is now in search ofthe Eye.
Good. She can lead us to it.
I highly doubt that her intent is to deliver it to her long-lost father.
Kill her.
Let her find the Eye or let her try, then kill her.
A dhamphir should be no match foryou.
Your suspicion was correct.
Domastir's on the move.
What is it, my child?
I have been separated from my family... and have been traveling for three days and nights without food or sleep.
May I seek solace in your monastery for a night's rest?
Please come in, my child.
Welcome to the Solambria Monastery.
Enjoyyour food, and then you may rest.
I suggest you follow me.
You're not one of Kagan's, are you?
No. I mean you no harm... but I must leave now.
I'm sorry. You cannot leave.
It seems that you absorbed the Eye.
Our order has been guarding it for centuries.
Why do you protect it?
Because the Eye holds powers.
Why do you think water no longer burns you?
There are three talismans- an eye, a rib and a heart.
They all belonged to a long-dead vampire named Beliar.
He discovered a method to defy those elements that destroyvampires- water, sunlight and a cross.
When he was finally defeated... his bodywas quickly dismembered... andparts ofit were hidden all overthe lands... out ofthe reach ofvampires.
If they become united again... they could make a vampire powerful enough to control the world.
Beliar's not my concern.
My mission is my own and not of evil intent.
You are a vampire... yet you are immune to the cross.
I am a dhamphir.
So Kagan's own offspring is his enemy?
How is it you know about me?
There has been talk foryears that Kagan was in search... of a prodigious child.
His bloodline is strong enough to produce one.
He is ourbiggest threat.
He has an army ofthralls- humans who choose to work for him rather than die.
And they can do things vampires cannot.
N ow you understand why I cannot let you leave with the Eye.
Father! Father!
The monastery's bei ng attacked!
Don't let Kagan get the Eye.
Where's the Eye?
You fool.
Kill her.
Hurry! Let's go!
He's taking her to Kagan's. You must go back to Brimstone. Put them on full alert that the monastery has been attacked... and the Eye is gone.
Brimstone.
Come closer.
Don't be afraid.
- Leonid's lair.
- Whywould Domastir bring her here?
Perhaps she needs to feed, or the sun.
Now that she has the Eye, we must capture her. Bring her back to Brimstone before it's too late.
Domastir, Domastir, why do you come here... and insult my palace with your stench?
I need shelter till nightfall.
Is that a gift you've laid at my feet, Domastir?
How delightful.
No, Leonid, she is Kagan's.
Kagan, the mightiest... of all vampires.
Funny, Domastir.
I do not see him.
She'll make a fine addition to my collection.
Touch her and your fingers are gone!
Such a dedicated peon.
Fine. Take her, then.
I have more than enough... to satisfy my needs.
But none with an eye like that.
She stays.
Remove him.
Help me.
Cut it.
Where did you acquire such a gem?
Give it to me... and I will let you live.
You have the Eye! You give it to me!
Give it to me, or I'll rip it out ofyour face!
So, we meet again.
Vladimir, I've always admired your spirit.
It's a shame you must die.
You fool, Vladimir!
The Eye. The Eye!
Let's get her out.
How can you be certain she'll be useful to us?
She has already been useful.
She stopped Kagan from getting the Eye.
- Yes, Vladimir, but-
- Listen.
I've been hunting vampires since before you were born... and there was always one that I suspected, or hoped, existed.
We have to consider what she is, Vladimir.
If she was simply a vampire, crossing the waterwould kill her.
And there's also that... which most vampires are not fond ofhaving.
Where areyou taking me?
You should be grateful you're still alive.
We helped each other.
I do not need you anymore.
I should skin you and hang you on display.
- Where's the Eye?
- It has somehow become a part ofher.
It has assimilated.
She must be brought to me alive.
Leave me.
I'll send further instructions.
Does she have a name, the dhamphir?
I have heard she is called Rayne.
What is this place?
Welcome to the headquarters of the Brimstone Society.
All in good reason, I hope.
There was a messenger killed in the monastery.
Master, the talisman has arrived.
Excellent.
This dhamphir's inconsequential.
It's Kagan you should be interested in.
There was a Brimstone in Rome.
It has been completely annihilated.
And that's not all.
Kagan has the Rib.
Release me.
What would make us think that you won't attack?
I told you...
I do not thirst for human blood.
Ifyou have live animals here- rats, even-
I will regain my strength quickly and be on myway.
I don't trust her.
I want what you want- to bring Kagan to ruin.
I speak the truth. He raped my mother... and murdered her in front of my own eyes.
Where is she?
- Where is the girl?
- There is no girl.
I will find her.
Sometimes we must have faith in others.
I believe you know that it's useless to fight Kagan alone.
Ifyou wish, you're welcome to stay here and train with us.
Thankyou.
May I have my swords?
All in good time.
Give herwhat she needs.
Yes, Katarin?
What lies ahead?
Will you be opening up the gates to the thralls?
That's ridiculous.
I am loyal to you, Vladimir... yet you're breaking the very laws and teachings you swore by.
Your newfound faith scares me.
What will happen to Brimstone in the event ofbattle?
I don't have all the answers.
We're growing weak.
Come on!
Control.
Physical strength without control means nothing.
Once again, from the beginning.
They belonged to a friend.
I know someone that might be able to help.
Our seamstress has prepared some clothing.
I hope they're to your liking.
Are you all right?
Ever since I got here, there are these noises that persist in my head.
I'm sure there's some reason for that.
I don't know.
Ifyou're feeling up to it... you're more than welcome to join us for dinner.
I don't think the food you have there will be of interest to me.
You act as though you're the only one who feels pain.
What do you know of pain?
My father's Kagan. My motherwas killed before my own eyes.
My mother and father were both killed... by Vladimir.
They had turned, and I was to be slaughtered.
Had he not arrived, I would not be here today.
Your food.
What, are we sitting at the table of the children?
We're running out of food.
We have to go to the mainland and get supplies.
No. It's not a good idea.
- We'll have to make do with what we have.
- We have to eat.
Perhaps your savior can multiply our supplies.
Welcome.
Won't you come sit with us?
It seems you've become very popular.
I thinkyou've breathed some new hope into the Society.
- This surprises you?
- I thought theywould be afraid of me.
They only fearwhat they do not know.
Can I see your teeth?
Darius.
So you're satisfied with your new clothing?
Yes. Thankyou.
Father... in the days since I receivedyourletter...
I have come to see certain truths that now give me pause.
I believe thatyou are right.
Brimstone is lost.
Be sure this message arrives.
- I t is of grave i m portance.
- Yes, Katari n.
The spoils of Rome.
Only one Brimstone remains.
Bring me my thralls.
The time has come to fulfillyour oaths, myloyal thralls.
Scour the land. Find Brimstone and destroy it.
Bring the dhamphir to me. Leave no human alive that crosses you.
The promise of eternal life awaits those who succeed.
Those who fail will find only death.
- N i ce form.
- Fi nal ly we agree on somethi ng.
Vladi m i r needs you.
He's i n the courtyard.
Good match.
Until we duel again.
You duel?
A little.
Your form is weak. You're lacking passion.
It's part of my plan.
I am tiring you out.
Your plan is lacking passion as well.
I see they have taught you well.
Hardly.
I was trained in battle by a great warrior... one whom has long disappeared fighting alongside Brimstone.
My father.
- Where is this warrior now?
- He is now a cursed enemy.
A vampire.
My loyalties lie with Vladimir... and the Brimstone my father protected as a human.
And what do your loyalties consist of?
You're a curious one.
My purpose is to fulfill my father's will- killing the very thing he's become.
It seems all this chatter has veered me from the task at hand.
You should pay more attention.
Keep your friends close, enemies even closer.
Vladimir taught me that.
We shall continue this later.
Good evening, Viscount. Kagan sends his regards.
I assume you were expecting this message from Brimstone from Katarin?
Would you stop throwing things at me?
You know, Elrick, Kagan has little patience for ambitious vampires... especially those that were once Brimstone.
Can a vampire not receive word from his own daughter... without being cast as a rebel in search of power?
- Is that the plan?
- Plans are for humans.
I think destiny is a more appropriate term.
Where is Brimstone?
Tell me now, or suffer the consequences.
Even you must sense that change is upon us.
This land has become unsettled.
The future must be held in the hands ofhuman-born... and vampire-perfected.
That is an invitation, by the way.
Spare Katarin, unseat Kagan... and join me in a, shall we say, more colorful reign.
Kagan's gratitude or Kagan's wrath.
Now, where's Brimstone?
You honestly expect me... to betray my daughter?
You know, it's funny.
You never struck me as the paternal type.
Now, get me the map.
Give us our destiny.
We leave now, and that will be the end of it.
You should travel with Sebastian.
Is there something you want to speak about?
You should not travel with her.
She's a danger to you.
Kagan is surely out looking for her.
You're an important part of the Brimstone Society.
Yourwork defending the fortress... is essential to our struggle and survival.
And no one has ever questioned that.
I am not seeking praises.
- I seek to feel secure.
- You are a leader.
Rayne is a fighter.
I will take Sebastian if it pleases you.
Iancu's been a friend for manyyears... and a defender of the Society.
We're very fortunate to have him.
Iancu has visitors.
Come for some chops, have you?
We'll be downstairs.
Watch your step.
It's a long way down.
Your kind of place.
Domastir.
We must move quickly.
What are those?
Black powder from China.
We will take them.
Is everything ready?
Take anything else you need.
Holywater.
- A gift from Brimstone. - Thankyou.
Brimstone's attacked.
They're all dead.
- That's not possible.
- It was Domastir and the thralls.
Are there any survivors?
You can't go back. There's too many.
- They came looking foryou.
- How did they find us?
I have dressings for his wounds.
This doesn't feel right.
- How would they know?
- This is what Kagan wants.
To lure back what's left of Brimstone to him... so he can destroy us once and for all.
Domastirwill paywith his life for this.
Iftheywant a fight, a fight theywill get.
It was Katarin.
You must choose.
Bargain for freedom... or leaveyour children motherless as a Brimstone martyr.
Never!
She's turned.
He's dead.
-J ust let me go.
- I can't.
- You will.
- Where are you going?
I'm going on my own.
Everyone who comes near me dies.
They came looking for me and the Eye.
None ofthose people had to die.
You too will be dead if I staywith you.
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm going to find the Heart.
With two ofthe talismans, I will stand a chance against Kagan.
How doyou expect to find the Heart?
I can hear it.
Good-bye, Sebastian.
Just wait. Wait.
Stop. Here.
You can wear this with pride.
Please?
And here.
This will protect you.
Sir, we've searched the entire grounds. There's no sign of the dhamphir.
She is not amongst the dead either, sir.
Perhaps she was never here.
We must return to Kagan.
She could be on herway there now.
- Prepare the boats!
- Yes, sir.
The Heart.
Perhaps there's some truth to this prophecy after all.
Even if she has the Heart, she can't face Kagan alone.
Nothing yet.
- Are you certain that it's down there?
- Are you questioning me?
My grandfather placed it there.
I would not risk all on folktales.
Why did we let the others die?
It was them or all of us.
We sacrifice animals to survive.
Brimstone is no different.
I will kneel before no one... norwill I sit here under Vladimir's command and await death.
I will not allow Kagan to take away our freedom.
The Heart will go to my father.
And ifyou want to live, you will secure the entrance until I return.
Yes, Katarin.
She's not coming. It's too late.
Have faith, Sebastian. She will be here.
I am here for Kagan.
What is she doing?
I have brought the Heart for my father.
Give it to me.
Come on.
You have what you want.
Now take me to Kagan.
All in good time.
Take her.
Well, Sebastian...
I'm afraid there's only one way in.
Get in!
Master.
The dhamphir has come to her senses and delivered the Heart.
Excellent.
- Shall I bring her in?
- No, not yet.
An historic night.
Prepare to witness the beginning of a new era.
Clear the room.
- Clear the room!
- Thralls!
Forward!
Capture them alive.
Take them to the dungeon.
There may be more.
Leave them in the cell for now and scour the castle.
The rats will be eating well tonight.
Enjoyyour stay.
And you, my dear, you will stay here until the ceremony.
- I know nothing of a ceremony.
- The Eye, dhamphir.
The ceremony to extract the Eye.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
It is good to know that you are both alive.
- I fear we're the only ones.
- What of Katarin? Is she still alive?
If not, then she died with honor... fighting for her people.
What do you know of this ceremony?
It's an ancient vampire ritual created to protect the talismans... in case they fall into the wrong hands.
What will come of me?
It is only a legend said to remove the soul.
Listen.
I do not know what is going to happen to me now.
I hope that you know that I am not foolish enough... to think that I'm going to prevail against him.
But I do not intend to stop fighting for a second.
Norwill we.
Open up.
And bind her hands.
It is time for the ceremony.
Come.
- We've got to find a way out ofhere.
- Well, let's get out then.
Even in absolute defeat, you're still not humble.
If I'm defeated and you're so powerful... then why must I be shackled when surrounded byyour thralls?
You're still a risk. I should thankyou now that Brimstone is eradicated... and you have so kindly handed me the Heart.
I would never have believed it would have been so easy.
Ifyou live through this, which is unlikely... you may remain here in my castle.
I would sooner rot in your dungeon than sit at your table.
So be it.
Let us begin.
Thrall, my companion is gone.
I don't know what's become ofhim.
Stand back.
Can't believe that worked.
Savage!
Please continue.
This is the end of Brimstone.
You have the Heart.
Give it to me.
You will have to cut it from me.
So be it.
You're strong, Rayne, but not skilled enough.
Give me the Heart, and I shall spare your life.
I would choose death over seeing you as my ruler.
With the talismans joined... vampires shall rule the earth.
As ifyour interests are noble.
For centuries, we've been cursed to the shadows, slaughtered by the fearful.
Have you not always longed for freedom?
You condemned me the dayyou raped my mother.
I will see she has vengeance.
Ungrateful bitch.
Choose to be human and die like one.
I will find her.
- The talismans.
- I don't care.
Kagan is dead.
But what about you?
Please. Please.
Please, you don't have to leave me.
It's my time.
Kagan's finished.
Whyostriches? - Do you have a taste
No .
Theyareverygood, like beef but with more flavor.
Thatisterrible.
Maybe. TheonlythingIknow is that they educate themselves.
Theysaythatthisisthecreationof the 21st century.
Doyouknowsomeonewhohasgrown
No, but I got help from a catalog.
Are you sure I should go?
Nat?
I miss you, Jodi.
You have such good care of me.
If I have my farm, you can come visit me.
Then you can feed the birds.
Just good for you only, it was an ugly fall.
This?
I do not know if I will heal if I do not use.
Better days Nat.
- Better days.
They say that this is the creation of the 21st century.
I have a couple friends in Wyoming that can help me as I am.
The country is too expensive.
I do not have much need. They will need a lot of space.
Can someone take me?
Depends how much you want to spend.
Spend? I would not if I had money.
Save you if you are there?
Save? I'm broke.
You lie, we know both.
Both? Who?
Go alone, thankless.
Idiots.
What ...
Is it?

He is not hurt.
Come on, it is dangerous.
Come on man, come on.
Let us here.
We can later retrieve it is not safe.
The show is over.
Should I drive?
We will help.
I am Herman Finch.
Thank you for me was to pick up.
I will not be too many questions ... but it seems that you are looking for a place to stay tonight.
Turn left here.
Are there Indians?
You have one here in the car, I am the eighth on mothers side ...
I have to do something, it will not take long
Wait a minute, stop by Mildred, she is a friend.
Nice place.
I would just sit out as I were you. Poor souls.
Do you work here?
- No.
Listen, I got a cramp in my leg, disturb it?
No, do it.
Cover me.
Call your father, Sal.
Call your family.
I don 't care.
I'm sorry boy, did you need it?
No, I do not think so.
What was that all about?
That was about respect.
Fucking crazy.
Okay, it's late.
I do not know what I can do for your repayable.
I need money for petrol, I want from here to Wyoming.
Such a beautiful car and you have no money for petrol?
I had high costs.
Have you already thought about him to sell?
No, why?
Because you clearly need cash, perhaps a crush on someone, if you know what I mean?
I can not say.
If you sell it I can maybe a little help.
From what year is it? '98 Or'99?
- I thought I already
It is a beautiful hotel.
It is beautiful, I seek the long to restore.
Painting you?
It is Dog.
Oh, it's a dog.
He is nobody, he is my friend.
This is the best thing I ever did for safety, otherwise I have eyes in my back needed.
Iris, we have a score for one of the huts.
A paying guest or a host-guest?
Come on.
Is that your daughter will help you here?
- My daughter?
My daughter?
How old do you think I'm way?
Do not.
- What?
Take me in the leg.
Here do not laugh with the law in Deep Water.
Thank you.
I am sorry if I have problems put in your hotel.
I had to let you browse as you it had requested.
They see everything you do.
You can not steal someone's car.
Not if you stuck.
I just want to go west.
I wish for once something good.
A few birds breed on my own.
Birds?
Yes, ostriches.
Okay, you got me yesterday service,
Whether you like to have or not.
Hey, Stoddard ...
I think you are a boy error've put.
Thus, it seemed, ever.
It was beautiful.
Hey, Kenny, how are you?
My knees have some practice is needed.
- That is right, Kenny.
Where is this going?
In the casino, they pay him a lot.
The gutters are in order, they have what be mended and painted.
You think you can?
I did something never done.
A disabled person can do with a arm tied to his back.
Are you too good for something productive to do?
Everything must be painted.
Sanded and herschilderd.
I think of nice dark blue. That goes with the country.
It is aan't rotting, animals in and fuck and fight ... and scare my customers.
It should be completed with cement or something ... And maybe put some wood so can not see the edges. Come on.
I do not think you have the choice.
So what can you disappear, you can be a bit savings, and your dream continue.
Can I get something material?
I want you not immediately a car up.
The owner of the warehouse is a friend and you can pay me back met't painting.
I can not sticking.
It is still a child.
Pam!
Be never bitter about.
It is not important what you did, it is what you have here what counts.
I can see you have a heart.
I take your word as guarantee what do you think?
I was sure that would happen.
I thought you never would include.
Have you done this?
You had to see your face.
You and I are going to have fine, son.
Why are you here?
What is your motivation?
My motivation?
My motivation is to provide customers of the casino to lure and you're my secret weapon.
I know how some things to do ...
If you need help with other cases, can I get a good assistant
There is not much to do at the moment, only in painting.
But I love your proposal in mind.
Is this the guy that you had?
Yes, he is looking for something respectable to get away.
That we do.
My name is Walnut, This is Peterson.
What is your name?
Nat Banyon.
He is fun.
I bet this one lasting.
It looks like you 30 years ago.
He would be called your son.
How much do you ask for Pontiac?
It is a fine car, very expensive ...
We will even look back.
This is probably what you find.
He is quite ugly.
- Ugly?
You will not buy cars for his beautiful line ... you buy him for his balls.
It is a Bronco, Nat.
Why do not you worry if you feel you would be better?
Come on, the keys are out.
And the Toyota front?
How much?
That looks nice.
Yes, a bit expensive, but I drive with a ... four cylinder, which is another type of car.
Now boy, do not miss your chance with this one.
You got lucky ... go for it.
- Be not afraid, start him.
How much?
Well, as long as we say voor't in Newport ... can you make a higher bid as Finch a silly goose. 1600.
What does that mean you hotel painting, you can pay off the car ... and you can continue with the adventure where we were talking about.
That means of course that my employee remains, at least until you've repaid me.
Sit.
Relax.
I do not know what you want.
- GA.
I see you've met Dog.
Who has saddled you with Finch, Charley or should you not say?
I do not know, nobody told me saddled with Finch.
He said nothing about the accident?
Then, I assume that you are here to the walls to paint, right?
What woodwork, Mr. Finch want it looks like a postcard.
You men are all the same.
They know not what they must invent.
It seems that Mr. Finch what neglect.
Disturbs you that?
That your husband treated you?
I am quite well.
Except?
Except that I have more rooms must clean up. Even if there are no customers.
Then we can perhaps pull.
You should watch it.
Only you and I are here.
You is for.
I am a married woman.
That will do, madam.
Doyoureallythinkthis a hotel, Nat?
See your customers
Excuse me?
Do further they keep everything in mind.
Really?
Agirllikemewouldnot her free will continue.
You're a beautiful woman, Iris.
Wecantalkwhenheis away.
When?
- That you never know.
Wecantalkwhenheis away.
Watch this once, that his only hands.
That reminds me of my hands when I was your age.
My hands?
Yes, that's an exceptional basis I watch.
Have you ever been in a ring?
Too bad.
Damn shame.
Listen, I want you to keep your job.
I have a problem.
latvian there is a good deer injured.
There is much blood.
It is not the sort of things to look at, you know what I mean?
Someone you should a collar put on.
That sounds like a party.
I just thought that it would go with the fifth seat.
Come inside.
Okay, what fresh meat.
Out. - Again?
I'm Sal. - Nat.
Is it, boy?
Yes, I have to go pee.
Admit it.
Comes.
You would not be.
- You do not ...
I note that even cracking.
Well, I have enough.
Finally.
Sal must pay much.
Why did you amateurs invited me here.
It's in my blood ...
My family in the'50s Las Vegas built.
Is he?
Enter.
They are coming.
Be not a bad loser.
Let me play.
I'm here with the cards play and take what is mine.
Go to hell.
Everybody who wants Sal leaves, sticks his hand.
This sucks.
- If you see something fucked up? See how you manage your books of the casino.
Mind your own business.
There is an empty chair.
Hold on.
It is a cheat, Nat.
Oh, the baby and the Lucchese family My blow, huh?
Say goodbye.
- Come on unload that thing in my face.
Wait, put that gun down.
- Shoot me down.
Shoot me down!
You will not laugh if you mountain raven is.
Relax.
Come on, I bring you home.
Where you going, sal?
There is enough place for even a body in the pond.
Will it go from here?
Yes, it's there.
Tell that asshole that his days are counted.
His days are numbered.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
One moment.
I'm here to paint to get Mr. Finch.
Dear God, he said that I still three days.
Who?
- Mr. Finch.
I swear that I am with him personally I talk.
Well.
Please, do not hurt my family.
Here.
Take my knees.
Save me in the hospital.
Of course, my work can do ... but I can not fault pay more.
Listen, I'm here to paint to get.
Then you're here voluntarily?
Where is he?
Finch? He is away on business.
- Business?
Well, tell him that I him the money the car will.
You can not leave.
I would be a wreck. You too.
He will not be happy about that.
I am not afraid of him.
Do this to me, I have to tell it.
If you do not like, why you keep hanging around here?
See?
What now?
I want with you.
We have to wait.
I do not wait until you tell me what here on.
I do not know, the only thing I know ... is that it has some dangerous friends that something will happen next Monday
This is a good reason to now way to go.
Where do we live, Nat?
Do you have a gold mine in the car?
The first day of the month there is a goldmine I suitcase in his room.
He thinks I do not know, I know.
If someone with money and his wife disappears, is not the kind of things you go to the cops.
Wecango to Wyoming.
No,no,it seemsthatacasino for you
TheonlythingIknow isthatI have to Herman Finch.
Friend, here is a casino.
It is 3km away. Take him with me.
Thank you.
Nat, I need you in the restaurant.
Come on, Nat.
Do not open your gift?
What is it?
If I say it is not a gift.
Come on, they only agree.
What are those for?
They use real boxers in the ring ... With a few rules.
Wil je me out now, Nat?
That would not be correct, Mr.. Finch.
I am a bit younger than you
You say it, yes ..
And your range is longer, you are in a better condition.
You are faster.
And what I saw, are your hands faster than mine.
Give me that glass, would you?
Underestimate me, Nat.
You are a dear boy, but underestimated me.
I do not fight against you!
You gave us yesterday seen after the game, huh?
Light that even in agents, I'm sure they just do their job. Excuse me?
Tell us what you remember.
My car is here all night left, right?
How can you be sure that he is not gone?
He sleeps there, that is where my car is parked.
I would like to hear from him.
Please.
No, I would have heard had his left.
It's pretty quiet.
What is it?
Sal after the game with his wife and children returned ... and they are obviously driving.
Perhaps his profits to Casino gegeaan.
He is not just money to have his pockets.
If you have what you need my artist back aan't work?
Listen, you need not fear.
Hey, it's nothing.
He is right. It is probably nothing.
Come on.
- See, Sttodart.
Take Fido along.
Give him a dog biscuit.
Here.
That is the chlorine.
Excuse me, can I buy cigarettes?
You want something?
- Water.
Thanks, honey.
How long are you staying here?
- In everything is painted.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
I never get anyone to correct answers.
Yes, you need a man your respects.
And I assume you know where I can find.
Take the package but you get it.
Fucking Joe Little Feet.
Come here every night.
Hello, I'm here really to paint ... but my feeling says that there is more.
Well, we are all in.
Deep, to our heels.
What's his game then?
I know nothing.
Especially if I can not know.
Iris, someone will see us.
- No.
We have no choice, huh?
- What do you mean?
We gotta go, I can not go.
If I go there, I put the next 4 years.
You know it, Nat? They know he did it.
Why have they not arrested him? - He is smart.
They wait until he makes a mistake, and that he will, I know ... but now we can do nothing.
And you want to stay?
If we wait we have that money for nothing.
All those police press Finch, he will never see coming.
We must stay calm.
- How many weeks?
How do you know you without warrant can?
Nobody accused anyone.
- The devil spoke.
Hey, dare not to my assistant to hold.
I told you ...
What a beautiful job you did here?
Yes, but I only have an ordinary car, not as shiny.
I hate that guy. - I know.
We have you checked, you're clean.
But I think you too much hay take your fork.
Maybe I can help you.
Yes, it will do.
Okay then.
I do not know whether Finch you paid ... But I know he has problems with the mafia.
Say you think the mafia is Finch?
- Of course not.
There is no mafia in that boerengat.
- Casinos earn much money, Nat.
Listen, I have nothing to do with what with Sal happened.
I know, because I know Finch.
Keep your eyes open, okay?
Maybe you see something.
Finch has no mispeuterd ... So, if you see anything.
I was awakened this morning, but fortunately, I will probably do until I die.
Next to me was Joe Little Feet, naked.
I have no problem in addition to Joe Little Feet to lie.
But I had to help him first to house them.
It seems that we both help need.
What?
We are still with the wrong people.
Really?
I had not intended.
Yeah, right ... Who else will you help?
Not Iris?
You're dumber than you look.
Have you not seen how they Finch follows as a lamb?
Maybe, maybe not.
Okay, you know what?
Then you have a good reason ... to which gloves to use and against his head to knock next week.
I do not fight with him.
I am here to earn money with my ostriches.
Of course you do not fight with him. Nobody does that.
He plays with you. And everyone knows it.
Come here, boy.
You are an old dog with big teeth.
He is a big teddy bear, huh?
It is incredible, Nat.
I can not believe it.
Are you money?
- I do not know.
People will start buying, you know?
Put your balls on a pool table.
Then you understand my drift.
We need to put chlorine we use it.
Shut up and do it.
No, it's cold.
- Not true, it's delicious.
I'm old.
- You are not.
Come on, come on.
- What gives?
This is life.
Hey, my hat!
I have everything I need.
Thank you.
I leave you time to think.
Come on, Nat.
Make some fun.
I am not a swimmer.
You will not tell me that you are afraid.
Look, you're bigger than the deep.
I have spoken with Walnut.
He says that you can use pocket to practice, now you have time.
Lift a little.
How are you, Nat?
Good morning, Nat.
It looks good.
It has really hurt me to you so that pool to see.
Why?
He is my man.
I say it.
You have a weird sense of humor, Nathaniel.
Within an hour inside.
You are also involved, huh?
If we make an appointment?
It's nothing personal to me.
- There is more.
- My God.
After the fight. Stay at his side and we are Friday
Maybe nothing. I swear that it is not safe to stay here.
I would not want you meeting mist.
I find Dog.
It is the first morning since he deserved that he is not.
I am talking about years.
What Dog now with these things to make?
You must continue to focus on this thing.
Have you ever had a dog?
Newhall is the only one bothering us.
The rest of the police state on our side.
That does not mean that we to be sloppy.
You find that a dog take is a sul.
What do you think we have a mutt do?
If you have something to say, say it.
I was once such a car. What?
Did you have a T-Bird?
Just the same.
I believe you said that you of 98 or 99 was.
This is at least 2000.
He is very good.
I was north of the waterfall almost an accident when I came here.
There was an animal in't middle of the road. It was all tears, it was horrible.
Those things happen.
Where does this truck come from?
I do not know.
Where did you say again that he came from?
He is this week for my country to appear.
I got it from a guy in another is purchased by auction.
These things happen often in my business.
I stayed because you and Finch public have a boxing match.
Right.
Once he has done with painting in the hotel.
Check this out, I love young blood.
He will save me and is quite excited.
I think I out of my head blood.
What is this?
- 857 dollars.
I am looking for where the rest is.
That is all I have.
The rest of the thousand ...
They were there for a thousand interest came from.
I have three days.
3 days, exactly 3 days after 3 days.
You know what? You will do what I tell you.
Jesus, Mr. Finch, its only 3 days.
Yes, it would not be smart when you get back for favors to ask.
Did you hear me?
I do not want a misunderstanding about what you have just seen.
Sometimes you hard with people who not pay their debts.
Yes, in Sal?
- Hey, I was never hard with someone it was not necessary.
I run an honest business.
I rouleaux.
I helped myself.
I will deliver the services.
It is the same reason why you small ranch to run.
But you do such a good work the Deep Water, that you will attract many customers,
I think you Herman Finch from financial matters out.
If you do not like, why do you like it not to?
We have all our debts, Nat.
They call you back
Hey, prijsvechter.
Welcome.
Do you have little money for the machines?
I hope you do not bad habits do.
This would make your piece.
No, I was not aan't play.
- That we know.
We have on the safety camera's view. Come here.
I want you to the new owner.
From the casino?
- Joe Little Feet has just signed.
What?
The fighter?
Can someone give him something to drink?
I do not.
- Ask not so many questions.
You know it, Nat?
You are so strong.
You know that you are correct.
If he beats in the ring he will be embarrassed for us to follow.
You should do it.
What is this?
I've told you everything, it's okay.
They think that an accident happened.
It seems so.
Probably the same beast that the deter animals in the region.
Nat, come here.
What happens?
- Do you have any view of this distance?
I do not want it on your damn hotel have, Herman.
You think I do not know that there are two people are dead?
It is not.
If you think I have anything to do have, I would walk free?
No, it's purely coincidence.
Purely what?
- An accident. So it seems.
Believe it or not, two accidents in a row.
Humbug.
I want to know what happens in the casino.
This is perfectly legal, and it is the right thing to do.
Treat me like an idiot or not, and tell me what is going on.
The reason why the casino at Joe's Little Feet name because he is 100% American.
The law does not allow a Indian casino has a thoroughbred.
Imagine the casino?
- Steal? From whom?
No, what we do ...
- It's okay.
It is not toxic.
You can eat.
I would not eat.
I know you do not want, but if you wanted then you could.
I want nothing to do
Nat, if it is not.
Wejustwanttohelp .
Areyoucrazy?
Ido notwantto think what I see now.
I'll not pay interest.
The interest?
I can not even follow Gus.
So, I stay here just mention, word drunk, and then separate our roads?
Or I shoot you.
Oh, then you no nothing?
Or are you going to shoot them all?
Maybe ...
- Say it.
Did you shit in your ears?
I thought your head was exploding.
You stood there staring.
She told me that you nice to find.
You had better know.
- Gus is angry.
I do not need your help.
Glad to see you.
People count on you.
I hope you man what ways learn tomorrow.
Stop just for you Iris is a widow.
I am with him.
Are they still in your head?
Have you not seen how they worship him?
Check this out. He is absolutely full of them.
God knows what he has done.
Sttodard.
Hey, Finch.
Are you ready for the big night? Finch let me inside you gentlemen game.
Really?
- It's okay.
The law should know what we do. If they just care.
They do not.
I hope you're ready, she is a nice price.
Who is a good price?
I went on to say something, Nat.
I thought we might just that had personal battle.
So I thought: if you win you can keep her. Free.
And if you win?
Leaving you without her.
Only with the clothes you are wearing.
You mean without the car?
I mean, without something.
This is a new home for you.
Where are you from?
The cafe.
I'm done, Pam.
I am in shape.
All or nothing.
He is bad with people, he takes you in the leg.
Say no!
Have you not seen how they worship him?
I said you should not talk!
Honey, I gotta go now.
He is coming.
Are you ready?
Where am I going?
Inside, you can not lose.
Ladies and gentlemen, he is not come ... the challenger today weighs approximately 70kg.
Nat Banyon, are you ready to fight?
Surprise!
Happy Birthday!
What do you say, man?
Where is the real ring?
- There is no ring, Nat.
We just want to thank you for the good work.
How does it feel to by Fincher to be damaged?
The car is yours Free.
We hope you stay here.
Do you remember what it was when you came from hell?
I have never in my life as a honest and hard working score seen.
And we really hope that you are here your home about.
And the battle then?
- It is a joke, Nat.
You think I go with you fighting?
I'm tired of my life.
No, you understand it.
Hangyourheadaroundthethroat, Nat Banyon.
It's neck!
Hang the throat around your neck!
Why has he done?
I think the joke is not has understood.
You got it up, Herman.
It is even more verkloot than it was.
What is it?
- We must go now!
Is there something wrong at the party?
- I do not know.
I think I've hit him hard.
But it was not a real fight.
It was a surprise, he told me.
What is the combination of the suitcase?
- What? What do you do?
Nat, are you okay?
It's okay.
We have the money needed.
We can always run.
The only thing that let me live in your arms are.
You know not what you say. I have never located between your arms.
Let me fall!
I love you, look.
It's okay. It's okay.
How long we have this information?
There is only a fax arrived.
What is it, Sttodart?
We have this morning a document received.
Nat has a criminal record. I think he probably is a child Joyride has done to ... But it seems that in a Nat Banyon institution has been.
He would have killed his parents when he was 14.
He dumped their bodies in a pond.
Klootz ...
Iris.
Where are we going?
Wyoming. Ostrich Nursery.
We have the money Finch not necessary I frankly deserve.
Finch had not steal.
Finch has not been stolen, had a secret until the deal was done.
What? Rob the casino?
The gang had casino over.
They all profit areas.
Finch just wanted to help Checking.
Nat, do you know what happened to Sal happened?
I have some problems Finch resolved.
Because he treated me like a son, just as my father would do.
I knew Sal risk for him.
And what happened to agent Newhall happening?
Agent Newhall?
I have also addressed.
He felt.
Pam, knew too much.
Tell me about her affair.
I think Finch is not alone.
I think he told Dog before we touched each other.
He was the eyes of Finch.
Dog and I understood each other of in the beginning.
Were you intimate?
I love you too, Iris.
This is the police of Newport. We have a kidnapping.
Send the patrol on the road.
We must be off the job.
I am sure that we are looking Finch.
Go left. I know the roads here in my head.
Okay, good.

Hotchicks.
That means more work.
Nothingthatwe cannot cope,Nat.
Chicks.
Chicks.
The earth really did moved!
- You felt that too?
- You better get used to it, with me, baby.
There must have been something...
My brothers says this place is cursed.
If they catch me stoned, and screwing with a mainlander, there'll be trouble.
Did you hear something?
- Shit, it could be them.
- Chill, relax baby.
- I'd better go.
- Come back, baby!
I'm sorry.
That wasn't funny.
Real scary.
Come on, baby.
Come back.
Let's have some more fun.
I can make the earth move for you again...
Oh, bollocks..!
What's up?
What kind of country-shit is this?
Is this your famous brothers idea of a joke?
It's not funny!
No, mate.
What are you doing?
You don't have to do that.
Come on, can we talk about it..?
Please, wait!
Until the government admits what they really know, we keep uncovering the truth for you.
So keep an open mind, and your cameras ever handy.
File #68: "Bournemouth sighting"
What the fuck is that..!
No, no, we saw it.
It was a mothership.
It was coming down from the sky.
And it sounded "wo-wo-wo".
That was some compelling evidence, proving further, that we, are not alone.
For Wierd Worlde.
I'm Michelle Fox.
Good night, stay strange and keep watching the skies.
- What is it, Howard?
- I got last months figures here.
Did our audience suddenly all died in a plane-crash?
We'll do alright..
What are you, high on life?
I mean TV-shop got more viewers than this...
Either you'll deliver something special,
- Or I replace you with someone who can.
- I didn't say I hadn't any ideas.
How about this?
I got a very strong lead on a recent alien abductee.
Abduction is hardly original, is it..
What's your angle on that then?
Picture yourself a Welsh farmer-daughter.
She's young, she's sexy.
She's abducted and now she's suddenly pregnant.
Here's the kicker though:
She claimed it all happened just one week ago.
- Look at the size of her stomach.
- Who's the father?
Please tell me it's E.T.!
I like it!
Contact her, tell her you'll be over, and this is what we'll do.
That camera-man you like so much...
- ... what's his name?
- Ricky.
- Now shoot this fucker!
- Yeah, he's cheap.
- Does he come with a crew?
- The sound-guy Jack.
Marking.

Take 1.
Die, motherfuckers!
Fuck..!
Sounds perfect, that's your crew covered.
What do you got in the way of experts?
I DEFINITELY BELIEVE
There's a guy, he keeps emailing the show with ridicoulus pedantic corrections.
- I said "experts".
- He is.
He's the head of B.U.R.C. "British UFO research committee. "
Plus, a nerd like him...
I recon he'll do it for free.
Also, I want to see a reconstruction.
Beef it up a bit.
Get some actor who can play both the alien, and the boyfriend.
My kingdom for a Babylonian whore!
Get someone good.
What about the girl?
Ah, let me guess?
Candy?
"To Howard.
You bad bad boy / Love Candy"
We use her because she's good.
Not because she's my girlfriend.
Oh, and Foxy.
Make it sexy!
Come on, inflato-boy.
On-locations-shoots that involves long drives, comfort is the king.
Don't be so embarrased.
Plenty of people suffer from hemorroids.
There's cream for it!
Why couldn't this fucking playstation be picked up in London, like everybody else?
He's doing some important research.
I don't know, the guy's a nut!
Oh, dear.
What have we got ourselves into..?
Are you alright, Mr. Gorman?
Michelle Fox?
Wierd Worlde?
!
- It's a real privilege to meet you, miss Fox.
- Michelle, please.
I really love your show.
You can't believe some of the LEY-activity around here.
Did I tell you about the time I nearly collapsed the church, by rerouting LEY-lines?
- I believe LEY...
- Yeah!
More about it later.
We got a very tight deadline.
We got to get into the island before the tide gets in.
Sacallum is a remote island 2 miles from the mainland.
It's only accessible during low tide, you can drive the coast-way, called "Devils spine".
We'll be lucky to have our spine left after this.
The spine is amazing.
It on a major LEY-line.
The island is owned by the Williams-family.
They've owned it for centuries.
It's been farmed since ancient times, on usually fertile ground.
No shops, no neighbors, no pubs.
And one of the greatest stone-circles in the whole of Great Britain.
- Isn't it going to be fascinating?
- Absolutely shit!
No pub?
! Wales..!
TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT
It's so bloody cold!
They do know we're coming, right?
Maybe they all have been abducted?
Hallo?
Miss Williams?
Anyone?
I can't find the fucking lightswitch.
Hallo?
Anybody home?
Just the wind, sugar.
Nice...
Oh, God..!
Fucking shit.
- Fabulous, dinner!
- Goldielocks, we're home!
- Where's the three fuckin bears?
- Who cares? I'm starving.
Shoot that for me.
Gasmasks?
The military must have got here first.
Our investigation is screwed.
What the fuck are you doing filming in our house?
Does anybody speak Welsh?
- Excuse me, does anyone here speak english?
- English?
!
Do you know Cat Williams?
I'm here to interview her.
My God, I'm fucked!
Remove that thing!
For fucks sake, stop!
- Sorry, my brothers don't talk English.
- English!
And they're not used to strangers.
What's with the suits?
- We may be cut off here, but not everything's old-fashioned.
We have a very progressive power-supply.
Manure.
We collect the waste product, and keep it in a system at the back of the house.
The hydrogen-sulphide it produces, powers the whole place.
It needs maintanance, so... Fast-gas for power...
Get the money first.
- Can you give us the pay you promised? - Here you go...
There's money for nothing boys!
Daft bastards looking for aliens, just 'cos some tourist knocked up our little sis!
I'm still not convinced that wasn't you, Llyr!
I'm sorry, but I was asleep when you arrived.
I left you out some food.
Local recipe.
Mostly cow's-brain.
We could do with some sleep.
We got a busy day, filming, tomorrow.
How long is it to the Devil's-teeths?
My brother's don't approve of what I'm doing.
- I hope they're not gonna be any trouble.
- Me too. They're mostly harmless.
A fellow "Hitchhikers guide"- fan I see?
Yeah...
What did your brothers say?
That they've seen bad omens in the sky.
And that no proper christian should go near those stones.
It's a cursed place.
There's an intriguing old legend about the stones.
They're said to be the gate of hell.
Should the devil manage to escape his prison... the stones themselves would cast him down from heaven.
Please, show me something.
One UFO, or a glims of an EBA.
Please...
Oh shit, I've overslept!
What the fuck..?
The name is Gorman.
Gavin Gorman.
The only way that we can save your planet, is if we copulate.
The dream...
I must go back to my dream...
Please, wake up.
You got to believe me, I just seen one of those FUO-thingies. Quick!
UFO!
How's that for a fucking guy-shot!
?
Do you like it, big boy.
God!
Gavin, Candy? !
Get the fuck out of here!
Dreadfully sorry to interrupt...
Candy...
UFO... saw... grab you camera!
Perhaps we should phone SETI?
You didn't wrote down it's sky-quadrant?
Seti, is that got to do with a sofa?
- No, no.
SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
I don't think little miss tits'n ass is down with any kind of intelligence.
She probably dreamt it.
Page one, the actors handbook:
Use your bleeding imagination!
- No fence.
- None taken!
Who'd do that?
- Maybe the visitors way of communication?
- I don't think visitors would use 6" nails.
That's fucked up!
Fuckin hell, disgusting!
We can't leave it like that.
Someone's got to kill it.
Come on guys, it'll be a mercy-killing.
Those farmers really freak me out...
Thank you...
I knew you'd reveal something to me.
As head of B.U.R.C.,-
I hereby welcome you to our humble planet.
Why not...
May you live long, and prosper.
It's amazing, a crop-circle.
Real proof of alien-visitation.
There's no doubt about aliens now.
- It's a first time for everything.
- Get the camera, and film this.
- This is proof.
- I wish that were true.
What do you mean, this is your dream come true.
No, it's a lie!
You made the crop-circle with these.
You showed how to do a crop-circle in your own show, last month!
Yes, it's my dream to find evidence of UFO.
You don't know how important it is to me.
There's alot of people who wants more in the world than their crappy 9-17-slavery.
You should be ashamed.
I thought your show was a voice of truth.
- You have a responsibility to the public.
- Yeah, to entertain them!
In 2 years I've been reporting for the show,
- I've never seen a ghost, goblin, monster or a UFO.
I'm sorry, but for me, it's just a living.
If I don't get a hot story this week, then my show is finished.
Do you want that?
I want the truth.
Yeah, but the truth ain't out there.
It's good that the aliens weren't real, you greeted with a line from Star Trek!
As head of B.U.R.C. I could not let you film this as evidence of real alien activity.
Well, we havn't yet.
Nobody fucks with a UFO-enthusiast!
The bastard's ruined it!
Why bother filming it now, they'll never let that on air.
- Sorry for oversleeping.
- Don't worry, you didn't miss a thing.
I'm sure we all want's to leave this paradise, so let's hurry.
Actors, get yourselves ready for the interview.
Ricky, come over here a second, babe.
I just wanna run over some technical things.
That's odd...
It's complete opposite...
What's up?
- Have you dodgy-wired it?
- No, it's from the stones.
The stone-circles are known to recieve energy.
They power their LEY-lines.
But this seems to be... emitting it.
Sometimes you get this sort of activity when a site's connected to a underground tunnel.
- I'd love to get a look beneath this lady's skirt.
I bet you would, you dirty bastard!
Nice one.
Let's shoot this fucker!
Miss Williams, tell me exactly what happened on that horrific night.
Hallo...
You smoked alot of pot that night. Are you sure you weren't just high and paraniod?
Paranoid...
For fuck's sake, I was forced to see him be murdered, and could do nothing about it.
I reported it, but it wasn't taken seriously.
I thought you'd understand...
The police still have him listed as a missing person, and the body's not been found.
- You think I killed him? !
- I'm just trying to understand what happened.
Yeah.
I'm painfully aware of how ridicoulus my story sounds.
The only reason I'm telling it to you, is to get money for an abortion.
Believe me, this isn't a pathetic cry for attention or a cheap shot of fame.
But I doubt it's something you'd understand.
So here's the deal. You wanna talk about alien-rapists, fine.
But making me look like some stupid farm-slut with a drug-problem, you'll make a misstake!
Actually, I was gonna make you an lucrative offer to film the alien birth.
Still, that was great!
Real emotions.
Top television.
Howard's gonna love it.
- Did you hear that?
- What, babe?
- Oh no, come on, finish me off!
- Hear the noises...
I've got to go.
So you run off over there...
No!
Okey everyone, that's a wrap.
Fuckin' woman drivers!
Fuck you two, the bastard-thing just cut out.
I doubt the auto-towing-service cover Hell-island.
Okey, try it again.
I can't understand it.
Come on, baby.
Why the hell are they moo-ing?
!
Yeah, something spooked them good.
- Let's have a look, it could be Gavins mate.
- No, I'm a sound-man, I don't do curious.
Okey, try it again.
Are you still not feeling well?
Don't worry.
The doctor is here.
Give it another go!
Shit!
Isn't this a common UFO-trace, Gorman?
Flattening crops is one thing, but mutilating cattle for a TV-program is sick!
- We didn't do this, Gavin!
- Whoever did this, did it recently.
Did you see something?
What did you see?
- Was it reptilian or gray?
- Pissed off, I'd say.
Candy!
Go, go, go!
Start the engine!
Start... Start the engine!
Michelle, this isn't covered by our insurance!
We're supposed to be responsible for the safety of these people.
I wote we get off this island now!
I'm a character-actor, not a fucking hero!
I can't believe you people!
This could be the most significant event of our century,- perhaps all history!
He's right.
This is what we're here for.
This could change everything for us!
Yeah, our status from living to dead!
What happened out there sister?
Something bad's out there hurting our flock.
Show him the footage.
They took that well...
What do you think they've got in mind?
Why you...
There there, calm yourself big lad.
She was special but we'll get another.
She'll never be the same!
Never!
Hey, monkey-boy.
This could be the chance of the lifetime.
We got to go back out there.
We can get real footage of aliens here.
Not the usual fuzzy out-of focus-shit...
Have you any idea how much it'd be worth?
That's alot of bananas!
Nice weapon.
Question:
Where are the love-couple?
To catch their bloody deaths!
Deserting us here, the asses!
- What are you talkin' about, bitch?
! - Now now, ladies. Let's be friends.
Atleast we'll be safe here darling.
Perhaps a drink to calm our nerves, yes?
- What the hell is this? !
- Localbrewed.
Too much for gay city-slickers?
Yes, atleast I never get pregnant.
Come on, Ricky.
Oh, fuckin' hell..!
The air taste like shit in here!
It's even worse than the manure-farm.
I don't even wanna know how this technology works!
Three-seat-model.
Reaches lightspeed in about 6.2 seconds.
Uses brain-steering.
Atleast, now we know how many aliens are out there.
The mainland-police says they don't have a plan for an alien-invasion.
But he wished us a nice evening.
Those bastards!
I think that's kind of sweet.
- Did you see that?
Her nose fuckin' lit up!
- Amazing!
It's an implant.
They're either have a tracking-device, or or somekind of remote-control.
- Do you think it's a good idea?
- It's safer if we get it out.
Too much for gay city-slickers, ey?
Looks like the locals gets smashed on it too.
Come, Cat.
Time to get in the game.
Got to sort my head out... Ugly runts 'aint they!
Michelle Fox here, reporting from an actual alien craft.
This stuff is really amazing, isn't it!
- What the fuck are you doin'?
! - Hand me the money, and I let you know!
Hell's shit, what's that!
?
Just keep filming..!
That's a good boy!
Come on.
Sit boy!
Let's get away from here, before the owners miss Fido.
You fuckin' rocked back there, babe.
- Thanks
- It's okey.
I fuckin' hate pets!
Think we should go outside and take a look?
This is a chance for contact.
Yeah, great!
Let's duke it out with the monsters from outer space!
- They prefer to be called "visitors".
- You'd know, cause you read it on internet?
!
- Don't pick on his because he's brave.
- Oh, shut up!
- "Braver"?
- You won't believe what these farmer's done!
This may not sound well for intergalactic harmony, but they're real!
Aliens are real!
Thank you!
Thank you, lord!
Don't tell us: "told you so", Gorman.
