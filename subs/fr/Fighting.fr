Somebody ought to call the cops on you.

Hey, Mr. Sou.
How you doing, Mr. Sou?
Good?
You know that Radio Music Hall up there?
Man, I'll tell you, they tried to kill me up there, man.
I bought some stuff from downtown.
It was a fake book.
I don't even know how you do a fake book.
I'm gonna get some umbrellas from you, is that okay?
Can I get some umbrellas from you?
Yeah?
You said $100 last time, right?
I got in a fight, lost all my money.
This is all I got left.
Is that okay?
That's $100 right there.
I got one $20 left, all right?
Man, I had my stuff at Radio City Music Hall. I ain't gonna go down there no more, though.
They're a bunch of crooks down there.
I'll see you later, Mr. Sou.
It's that kid from before, Harvey.
He's coming in here.
Can I help you?
Come on, look, I want my money back, okay?
What money are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
Look, I don't mean no...
Come on.
He took it.
No, he did not...
Okay, I want it back right now.
He took your money?
Okay. Same shirt and everything.
This is Z and as you can tell, he's a little retarded sometimes, okay?
Harvey.
Look, listen.
How much are we talking about here?
Don't give him shit.
No, no, listen. I've got this.
How much...
Hey, that's not nice.
That's not nice.
Here, thank you very much.
I should call the police on you, you know?
You should.
That's exactly what you should do.
I'll wait here for you if you want.
You know, you shouldn't be robbing people, you know that? And especially ones that can come and find you.
Why don't you sit down and talk to me for a second?
I just want to have a conversation with you.
I was talking about you earlier.
Look, try some of these bread things, they're terrible.
You're going to go after this kid? Hey, wait up a second.
Where you going?
You know, that was some show you put on out there today.
In the streets, you know, the fisticuff thing.
Can I ask you one question, though?
I'd much rather you just stop following me.
I'm not following you, I'm walking down the street.
But look, if you want to make money...
You know...
Sorry, buddy.
There ain't no friends here.
Think sitting behind a desk, sucking ass all day, is making money.
Look, I'm Harvey Boarden, all right?
Let me introduce myself, I'm Harvey Boarden.
Shawn MacArthur.
Good to meet you.
You like to fight?
If I have to.
I can make you $5,000.
Got you interested, huh?
You see that store right there?
You ever wonder how little places like that stay in business?
BMW parked in front of it.
People dressed nicely.
They like people that like to fight.
You want to make some money at it?
Yes or no?
You don't want to make no money, you don't have to go.
You can go on with your life.
I can make $5,000 with you on one fight alone.
You can stay there and go home if you like or you can come and get $5,000.
Wait, hey.
You ain't got no place to go, go where you're going.
You better give me $5,000 if I walk across the street.
Come on, break out one of them umbrellas.
It ain't raining.
You're right.
You know these guys, you ever seen these guys before?
I'm like an agent for them, I get them talent and stuff.
Hey, Christopher, Jack.
Hey, Harvey.
Hey, Claudette, Martinez.
Chinese guy named Martinez. What?
Go figure.
That guy was Chinese?
Yeah, his mother or something.
But those guys, they run every bet place in this whole city.
And that's what matters 'cause that's how you get paid.
Hey, Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson.
Harvey, I have to thank you so much for those Billy Joel tickets.
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.
You look lovely tonight, ma'am.
Did he do my favorite song, the "Downtown Alexa" thing?
Okay.
Hey!
What are you doing, Harvey?
No way.
No way.
I gotta go to 38th Street to get some juice.
It's about to rain.
Get in the car, drive. Get in the car, Z.
I got an umbrella for you anyway.
Come on, get in.
Get rid of the box, you don't need that anymore.
Where are we going?
We're in a $100,000 Mercedes.
That's where we're going.
Okay, so what happened to the $5,000?
Hey, here's your boy.
Good morning.
Thanks for showing.
I got your text, so here I am.
You need a soda or anything? No, I'm cool.
Do me a favor. Go get me a orange soda or something.
So what goes on here?
Well, we're going to get you an opportunity.
You want to fight, right?
I want to make money.
Okay, first thing, we got to make you presentable.
Put this on.
I don't want to wear your jacket.
Presentation is everything.
Come on.
It's about making money.
I'm going to give you an opportunity.
Real nice smile.
This thing don't even fit me.
Where's my change?
It was $3.
You know, I can get that for $1 across the street.
Yeah, and you could have gotten it for 50 cents at the supermarket.
Comedians.
Come on.
I don't...
We're going to make some money? Yeah.
I feel stupid.
If they invite you over, tell them you can fight, 'cause you can, you know?
Better yet, don't even say nothing to them, let me do the talking and I'll take care of everything.
Yo, Harvey, you want a stove?
Hey, Christopher, you guys are still doing the fight stuff, right?
I've got a guy right here.
Hey, Z, bring him over here!
This kid right here is an incredible fighter.
Oh, yeah?
Jack.
Jack.
Tell me, when was the last time that you had a white guy that looked like this in one of your fights?
And you did college and everything, right?
You went to college?
That is remarkable.
He's the real thing.
A white kid who went to college, that's amazing.
How come I never heard of you?
Well, he's from...
No offense, but I've never heard of you either.
Look, I'm sorry, you know, sometimes he's a wiseass.
But he's...
I'm not joking here.
I'll give him a peep.
Yeah, I'll give him a peep.
White boy who went to college.
Thanks, Jack.
Can I get my jacket back, please?
Why'd you go talking to him?
He asked me a question.
You got to let me do the talking from now on, okay? Please.
Okay.
Please.
You know, I'll beep you if he calls me.
Come on.
Beep me?
Well, I'll page you, text you, whatever.
Where are y'all going?
What, you lonely, you need a friend?
We got things to do.
We'll text you.
Now there's these junk stores and these vendors and these big signs and overhead construction cranes and all this...
Lady!
What are you yelling about?
You know, they used to sell drugs in that building.
Well, that's okay, but now they've got men riding elevators to wash the windows...
Well, let them...
Move on, it's okay.
And you take your life in your hands just crossing the street, there's so much demolition stuff all around.
Look at it...
After you.
Hey, Giovanni, you got a refrigerator in there?
Last one, baby, get it while it's hot.
Baby, come and get one, buy one, get one free.
Come on over.
They had money on you not making it.
So this thing's for real?
Yes, it's very real. Very real. $5,000?
Yes, but minus costs.
Hey, be careful with those shoes there.
Minus what?
Costs.
This is Alexander.
Ray, Alexander.
Ray, Shawn.
You roughed them up the other day, so they're gonna ride in the front and drive and you're going to be in the back with me.
No, no, I'm driving, this is my car.
And it's a very nice car.
You know, if your boy wants to go, we can go.
Wait a second.
Come on, man, look, I wasn't interested in no trouble with you, so you need to relax, okay?
Where's this hostility coming from?
Text me again, and I swear to God I'm gonna hurt you.
He keeps sending me these stupid little things, you know.
Just costing me money.
Come on, Harvey.
Why am I sitting in the car and it ain't moving?
Come on, these little texts that you keep sending me are costing me $1 a minute.
So, what, I'm going to fight this guy, then what happens?
Well, we go in, you win, you get $5,000.
You lose, you get nothing.
So we get paid tonight?
Yes, we will get paid.
You keep asking me the same question.
All right, Harvey.
So what, they got rules or something?
They don't like scared, okay.
There's the church.
Yeah, if you kick him in the nuts, you win. Right.
There's Sydney up there.
Gouge the eyes, everything. Come on.
Come on, Z.
This is Brooklyn, huh?
Yeah, as you can see.
Hey, there, Sydney. How you doing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're late.
We have to have this place cleaned up by the morning, so hurry up.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Here you go, do what you got to do.
Excuse me.
Scratch, bite. Thank you.
Yo, smells like farts and ass in here, you smell that?
Smell like pure vodka.
The place is a playground, but, like, bad.
Filled with bad people.
Fighter.
You ready?
Go make some money.
Hey, Jack.
Harvey, you running on Caucasian people time, huh?
I'm running. I'm running.
You're running?
Yeah, you keep running.
Na zdorovie, brother.
Let's see what you got, Shawn!
Let's see it, Shawn!
Go, go, go, go!
Yeah.
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Hey, come here.
It's over, it's over.
Come on, have a seat.
Don't smile at nobody.
Just sit down.
Watch yourselves.
You got some tissue in your pocket?
Anybody got tissue?
Give him some tissue.
He can fight, right?
On the water fountain.
Told you he could fight.
So you both should come to the club.
He's going to need a jacket.
I got to get out of here.
Give him your jacket.
I can't stand Brooklyn.
You tell Jack I know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
No, we're special guests of Mr. Dancing.
Could you just see for me?
I'm telling you, we're on the list.
Will you let Renee know I'm on the list, please?
Let them through.
Two of you.
Now, come on, Harvey.
Harvey!
I feel like a bum.
No, you look great.
Cordell!
Cordell, Harvey Boarden.
We're VIP. We're VIP. Hi.
We got VIP.
That's reserved for us.
Right here. They ain't gonna tell us.
Try to ink out.
Come here, have a drink.
You gonna introduce me to your friend?
Shawn, this is Shevonne Dubai.
Am I pronouncing that right?
Have a seat. Have a seat.
Yo, yo, yo!
Come here, where you going?
Yo, man.
I heard you were great out there in Brooklyn today, man!
He's a winner, he's a real winner.
Yeah, look, I meant to say hi to you the other day on the street, but with Harvey, you never know when anybody's anybody, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I think I saw you out there.
Yeah, yeah, you guys are just coming from dinner, right, something like that?
Right?
No.
Yeah, listen, man, you ever want to dine, I'll take you to a place where you don't have to sit at a counter, you know what I'm saying?
Shawn, right?
Yeah, that's his name.
Listen. It seems we're going to be working together, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I heard he'd already lined up to fight big boy over there.
Yeah, yeah, well, I was talking to him about that.
What is this, Harvey, $10,000?
Since when are you into this kind of stakes?
Can he just rest for a minute?
He just had a fight.
You want some water? Yeah, yeah.
Can I get you some water?
Poor Harvey, man.
Let me ask you something.
You think you could beat big boy over there?
Do we think he can win?
Harvey, I wasn't asking you.
I was asking your friend here in the nice blazer, with the blonde.
Can I do that?
Can you all pardon me for a second? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Harvey, you're gonna lose that real quick.
Watch.
Excuse me, Harry Potter book.
You got to be kidding.
Okay.
I knew I was going to see you again.
Look, I feel bad about that book.
Look, you remember me?
You remember me, don't you? I remember you.
We spoke, you...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hey, look, I just wanted to take you to dinner or something.
I'm good, thank you.
No, I was thinking maybe sometime something without a counter.
That's all. That's good.
I like that, without a counter.
I just heard somebody say that upstairs.
You heard somebody say that.
Okay.
No, look, I just feel bad about the book, kind of want to, I don't know, make it up to you.
Hey.
Thank you.
Looking beautiful as usual.
I'm Shawn.
Zulay.
Zulay.
That's pretty.
Thank you.
I believe in fate, so... I don't.
Oh, no.
What do you think?
If I see you again, then we'll call it fate.
Okay.
One more time.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Counting on it. All right.
Okay.
Zulay.
Bunch of losers in here, man!
Someone tell that idiot the whole place is filled with losers.
Right, Harvey?
Hey, so we got another fight, huh?
Yeah, we are, but we're gonna talk about it in a second.
I'm going to meet you over there.
So what did you say, $10,000, right?
$10,000, that's like a hundred $100s.
There he is.
Shawn, this is Jerry.
Jerry.
Nice to meet you.
This is Jim.
And that's Joel right there, and these are their dates.
Look, I'm going to meet you over there and we're going to talk about everything.
Shawn.
You know, we lost a lot of money betting on your ass to get beat tonight.
Well, maybe you'll bet the right way next time.
And what's the right way to bet?
'Cause, you know, I wipe my ass with a hundred $100s.
Come on, come on, come on. Hey, hey.
Just have a seat.
I'll be over there in a second.
Come on, Jerry.
Excuse me, we're sitting here.
You're Evan Hailey, right?
Yeah, and you're wearing contacts.
Holy shit.
Shawn MacArthur.
I'm sorry, man, is this your girl?
Uh-uh.
So what brings you to New York, man?
Well, just...
Martinez.
How you doing, man?
Hi, bud, I know who you are.
But you have to excuse me for a second, I'm just... I'm bugging out a little bit right now.
You all two know each other?
I know who you are.
Yeah. Yeah, we know each other.
I used to wrestle for Shawn's father back in Birmingham, Alabama.
So how is your father? Yeah?
I'm sure he's fine. Mmm-hmm.
You know, I'm going to let you all have a good night, okay?
I'm gonna go ahead and get out of here.
Hey, come on, man.
Relax, man, come on, sit down.
Hey.
Don't touch me.
"Don't touch. " You know what...
You worried about your jacket? Huh? That's the problem?
I'll buy you a new one, how's that?
I don't need your jacket.
No?
Hey, is everything okay over here?
Harvey.
These two guys are old friends, man.
Evan just was offering to buy him a new jacket.
I said I didn't need a jacket.
Come on, Shawn, look.
You guys. I'm Harvey Boarden.
Harvey Boarden, go wash my car, man.
You know, somebody might hurt you for doing something like that.
That somebody going to be you?
Come on, let's go.
You should go, Harvey.
You're bad, man.
Yeah, Harvey, you can go now.
Neolithic-looking idiot. Always saying my damn name.
My daddy used to tell me, "Nothing good happens after 10:00 p.
It's got to be damn near 2:00 now.
Right?
Yeah.
You knew that guy, huh?
Yeah, he used to wrestle for my dad's team.
Really?
You know, I'm gonna go, okay? Well, where you going?
What, you need a friend now?
What?
I'm just gonna go for a walk.
Okay.
Good night, Zulay.
Good night, Zulay.
Good night.
Zulay.
Like July?
Yeah, that's right.
I say that right?
You did.
I figured I'd take fate into my own hands, you know.
And you did.
I have to go.
I...
Nice seeing you, Shawn.
Oh, you called me Shawn.
That's cool.
Hey, you make sure she gets home okay.
Okay. Thank you.
All right?
Thank you, Shawn. Uh-oh!
Don't use it again.
My name.
That's good.
Good night.
Hey, King Arthur, it's Merlin.
Hey, man.
What you doing here?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
What time is it?
You fell asleep on the bench.
You look like a crackhead.
I just sat down for a second.
And...
Wow.
I can't believe you just saw me sleeping on the...
I just sat down, just for a minute and I don't know, I just kind of went to sleep.
I can't believe it.
I've got an extra room at my place.
You can stay there. Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'm okay.
If you like.
No, you're not okay.
I was just about to go to a hotel, man.
Yeah, 7:00 in the morning.
They don't even check you in until 1:00.
You don't have to stay at a hotel,
I've got a place right around the corner.
But you can stay there until you find another place.
All right, look, I'm gonna pay you.
Yeah, you're going to pay me back for sure.
Come on, grab your stuff.
If somebody saw you sleeping out here, you know what they'd think?
We wouldn't make no more money.
Nothing's free in this world.
I just was there for a minute or two.
Well, you're in deep with Harvey Boarden now.
So we're going to work it out.
Make sure you wipe your feet on that carpet right there.
I'll shut the door.
Okay, so here we are.
Fresh paint job, new lamps.
It's all right for now.
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You know, for now, at least.
But anyway, here's your area.
That's a Sealy ostropedic.
I got that new.
You like Broadway? You know?
Yeah.
'Cause I got tickets, you know, like Legally Blonde and Wicked.
Wicked's a very good one.
I don't go too often, but when I do, I go and see that one.
Is that you?
Yeah, don't mind those, that's me, Jack and Martinez, you know, and...
Well, we were going to be these moguls, you know?
We used to sell tickets at the Garden. It was when we first got here.
So you ain't from here, either?
Are you kidding me?
I'm from a place with some culture.
Chicago, you know?
But I guess you've got your own story, too, right?
You left your suitcase out here.
What, you got gold in there?
My father used to always say, "Stay business, ready for business. "
Well, you got to...
So you got a plan or something?
You know, like a big plan with this fight stuff?
Yeah, I didn't travel all the way to New York just to be some hustler.
I figured I'd save up some cash, play some professional ball.
Open up a IHOP. You know, with an office in it and my name on the door.
What, like an International House of Pancakes?
Turns out all I ever was was a two-bit hustler.
Well.
Guess that's not so bad though, right?
Well, by definition, that's just somebody who can't win, that wins.
We just won.
I'm just saying. You know, if that's...
Get you some rest, Shawn MacArthur.
Go to sleep.
We got a big fight coming up.
$10,000, right?
Yup.
Jerome. This is Jerome, right?
Looks like we're here.
Yeah.
Look at this tough.
I bet they won't complain about somebody putting up new buildings around here.
Come on, you guys, get in.
It took you long enough, man.
That guy's waiting on you.
Shawn, ready to get your ass busted?
This is where you take me, Harvey?
That's for suckers, man.
Hello, ladies.
This is what I'm talking about.
What's up, girls?
Yeah.
How you doing?
She's cute, yo.
I like that.
You're cute, why you got a mad face? Put a smile on your face.
Not my fault.
I wonder why I don't come to the Bronx that often.
You know this kid, right?
Yeah, man, he's a big dude.
Don't get too close.
Yeah, thanks for that.
There you go, there comes the king.
Yeah.
Get a good look at that, all.
Bring out the cash, papa.
Bring out the cash.
Do it.
Whoop his ass.
Come on.
Come on, Shawn.
Move, Shawn!
Move, Shawn!
Stick and move!
Work it!
That's what I'm talking about!
Ah!
My throat!
Come on, Shawn.
Shawn!
Shawn!
No, no!
No, Shawn!
Shawn!
What are you doing?
He knocked my shit over!
My ear!
Hey, what are you doing?
We don't want no trouble!
We don't want no trouble!
Hey, come on, move!
We don't want no trouble!
I don't want no trouble!
I swear to God, I don't want no trouble!
Come on, open the door!
Push gas!
Yo, my ear, man!
He's okay, right?
Yeah, his ear's a little messed up, but he's all right.
He didn't...
Did he say it was a dog?
You know, he didn't fill out no police report or nothing?
A dog?
Yeah, a dog.
Can you call him?
Yeah.
Nobody's getting paid.
I'm going inside.
You should put some ice on that hand. Gotcha.
It was a good fight, man.
Thanks, man.
Hey.
All right.
We really ain't getting paid?
We ain't getting nothing 'cause of them damn maniacs in the Bronx.
I really need money, you know.
Really.
Look, I'm gonna work something out, okay?
Okay.
I'm late every day for work. It doesn't matter.
Go, do your job.
I will, and the last time, it wasn't done.
Please, let me do the job.
Okay.
Lila, you're going to be good, okay?
Remember what I told you.
Abuela, I know, I'm just telling you.
I'm telling you, I'm reminding you because you forget a lot of things, you know?
Take it easy, young lady. Let me go.
Out?
Okay, out.
Let me go.
You relax.
Are you sure you know how to get home safely?
You make me excited.
I know how to drive better than you, you know that.
Okay. Bye.
You know better.
Oh, my goodness, what kind of lady?
Be good, Lila.
Oh, my God.
It's a funny thing, us keeping meeting like this.
Are you going into work now? Yeah.
What are you doing here?
I was just walking by, for the past two hours, hoping you'd show up.
Oh, stalking?
Okay.
No, I just wanted to see if you wanted to come get something to eat with me.
I have to work. I have 20 minutes.
Just like...
Twenty minutes?
You're the first one here anyway, come on.
Remember, I've been here for a while.
So you want to go?
Yeah?
I have to be back, though, 'cause I work here.
I'll get you back, come on.
Twenty minutes. Twenty minutes.
Like, you don't have to go if you don't want to go.
Twenty minutes.
Okay, let's go.
Twenty minutes.
If my boss calls me, I have to go. Okay, let's go.
Thank you.
Here, let me get that for you.
Oh, okay.
I'll get you some sparkling water, okay?
Okay, thanks.
Is that good?
Yeah, yeah. No, that's good.
So, is this okay for you?
No, this is good, this is good.
This is...
It's good?
Okay.
I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna eat.
I think I'm just gonna have a calamari.
Okay. By: BackFire
You know, I ain't that hungry.
All right.
You're not hungry?
No, not really.
Thank you, though.
I'm good.
So, that little girl in the car, that was your daughter?
Yeah.
She seems sweet.
I saw the way she was looking at you.
Yeah, she's sweet.
What?
I'm sorry.
There's a big pink thing coming down the road.
Yes.
That's pink bunny man.
You think that's funny? Wow.
That's a lot of bunnies right there.
You want one of them things?
No.
You know, I'm gonna go get you one, hold on a sec.
No.
He's really gonna go get one.
Excuse me, sir.
Can I get one of these bunnies?
Yeah, right on, my man.
How much are they?
$5.
$5?
Here you go.
Thank you very much, sir.
You have a good day, okay?
You too.
Excuse me.
Pink bunny.
Thank you.
You didn't want that thing, did you?
My daughter's going to love this.
She thinks the guy's from outer space or something.
So what's her name? Lila.
Lila?
That's a good name.
That must be my boss.
I can't stay.
I can't be late for work again, so...
Well, you just ordered.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just late. No, no, no, no.
This is our date.
This is our date.
Don't even worry about it, I'll wait for the check.
Date?
Yeah, it's a date.
Date, okay.
All right, well...
Yeah, get out of here.
Don't be late.
See you later.
Okay.
You're in a rush always.
Sorry, I know.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Harv.
What the hell is wrong with you?
What is this?
What happened to the whole, I don't know, "be ready for business, business ready" thing, huh?
When I'm not being chased out of the damn Bronx trying to hustle up you some money, I'll be a little more alert.
That ain't my fault.
In fact, they actually want you for another fight this Friday.
Are you up for that?
Yeah.
How'd you do that?
Well, I told you, I got my connections, you know.
It wasn't easy either.
How much this time?
Well, that's what I want to talk to you about, but give me a second, I need to put my clothes on.
It's about this guy you're about to go up against.
You know, I know you're a tough guy and everything, Shawn, but you're not going to beat him.
But he's gonna...
Come on, I can handle myself.
I know you can, that's why, when he puts you in the choke move, you're gonna go to sleep, it's that easy.
What are you saying?
I think you know what I'm saying.
No, I don't know what you're saying.
Sounds like you're saying you want me to throw it.
Well, whatever you want to call it, you know?
We're gonna make some money, not like up in the Bronx.
You're complaining about that whole thing, right?
No, I'm not losing.
I know you're not gonna lose, you're gonna do what I'm telling you to do.
I appreciate everything you did for me. But, you know, the only way I'm going to lose is if somebody beats me.
Okay, then, whatever, let him beat you.
I'm serious.
Martinez came up to me, he said,
"You know, hey, if you go around with me, that's fine, man. " I don't know.
What?
You and Martinez what?
What do you mean, "what"?
I want to hear why, you know, you said, "Martinez... "
I didn't say I was gonna do anything.
No, I want to know what you're gonna do, 'cause...
I mean, here I'm trying to talk to you about making you some money, and, you know, nobody made anything up in the Bronx, right?
You know that.
I know that.
I understand.
I know.
And you're gonna threaten me now, right? What?
I'm not threatening you.
You're not threatening me?
I take you off of a park bench, and you're going to threaten me in my house?
Harvey, I ain't threatening you.
No, I know you're not threatening me, 'cause you know why?
'Cause you're gonna get out of my house now, Shawn.
Look, hold on.
I'm sorry, okay? No.
No, no.
Get out of my house.
Grab your garbage and go. Okay?
Okay.
Hey, there, Ms. Florence.
Dog's got a demon in it.
Demons.
You know, I gave you a place to stay, Shawn, 'cause that's what you needed.
It was a place to stay, it didn't have any of this other stuff.
I understand that.
You saw that picture I showed you of Martinez and Jack and me?
I didn't say I was gonna go with him.
I had a whole lot then, Shawn.
He broke my leg for $100.
That's crazy, right?
$100.
All I was saying is, I wanted to win.
That's it, that's all I wanted.
It's funny, you lose one step in this game and everybody leaves you.
At one point, there was a whole lot of people that would put a whole lot of money on me.
You really think you can beat this kid, huh?
I hear he's fierce, you know?
'Cause if you lose, you get nothing.
You win, you get...
You get $30,000.
Okay.
Okay, we'll do it.
Hi.
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
So what are you doing here?
Waiting for you the whole time.
That's a man, bro.
You're a man?
Hell, no.
Sit.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Z, fold this up.
Harvey, you know you got no business in a place like this, right?
Come on, Shawn.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Get out of there!
Get out!
Pick his ass up!
Come on!
Get up!
Yeah!
There it is!
Yeah!
Yo, Shawn, get up.
We won!
Yeah, baby!
We won!
Get up, get up, yeah!
No more deliveries tonight, man.
You!
Your man got knocked out!
What, baby!
That's us!
What!
You saw that!
You saw that!
That's us!
Yeah, baby!
Well, looks like Harvey's got a winner.
That's us, baby, all the way!
Get out of the car...
No, no.
I'm proud of you.
You put the works on Bruce Lee, though, man!
I got to give it to you.
Get out of my car.
Come on, Harv.
Let me out.
Come on, Harvey, let's go.
Let's get a drink, Harvey.
Aren't you going to have one?
No, I don't want to.
Go, it's your night, have a good night.
Man, it's raining, come on.
I'm going to go home and count my money.
Leave me alone.
All right, grandpa.
Don't get in no trouble.
I'm serious, though.
Come on, serious.
Come in, just have one.
I ain't got nothing, go.
Thanks for tonight.
Thanks, Renee, I appreciate it.
Yes, sir.
Please tell me you're not still putting money in your sock.
What'd your father used to call that?
Niggerish, that's what it was, right?
So this is who you hanging out with these days, Shawn?
These your boys?
Saw you step out your fancy stretch limousine there.
What, did you all pass around a hat to get that?
Take up a collection?
You know, the only enjoyment I got back in college, Shawn, was watching your asshole father humiliate your shit all over the place.
Really?
Until your bitch-ass cold-clocked him in front of the whole gym.
Come on!
I'm right here!
Do something! I'm right here!
Shawn!
Look at me!
Like your bitch-ass daddy.
Shawn, Shawn, what are you doing?
I ain't your father.
You can't go to a club and have fun.
That's right.
I'm cool.
I'll see you around.
Let's get out of here.
It's ridiculous.
I don't even...
I can't stand him.
I just...
It's not late.
This guy's always putting these notes on people's doors.
It's not late, though.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I hit you with the door.
So...
This is my living room.
I have to go and check on Lila, so have a seat.
It's nice, right?
It's really nice.
Thank you.
Big TV.
It is, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Shawn.
I'm Zulay's friend.
She brought me over to...
Zulay.
Zulay.
What happened?
This is...
I'm sorry, this is...
This is Shawn.
Shawn, this is...
I don't care who is he.
I care why you bring anybody at this time to the house.
He look like a criminal.
I know...
You're not supposed to bring nobody at this time to the house.
I'm sorry...
Don't be sorry. Don't do that to me no more.
Okay?
Please, don't say "por favor. "
I don't want to hear nobody in the house at this time. Hi.
What are you doing up this late?
What's that?
My pink bunny.
Sorry.
What are you doing up?
My grandma thinks you killed someone.
He didn't kill somebody.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why are you up, baby?
I want to see the scary man.
I hear that I'm gonna cook for you.
I'm gonna do it, but as soon as you eat, please, you got to go.
Okay?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry.
Look at the way you are. Look at you.
Please, it's okay.
I'm sorry, actually, you know what?
Look at you. Look!
You know what? I need some thread.
What a shirt.
I'm going to fix it for him.
I'm gonna take a needle and do some job.
That way he don't gotta stay like that.
You don't feel bad?
I do.
What kind of men look like that on the street?
Thank you so much for the...
Come on, no.
Back.
Back, let's go back.
I don't want to go to bed.
Let's go back, back to sleep.
Shawn has something he wants to tell you.
What?
I don't understand what you talk.
Talk English, Spanish?
Okay.
She's wide awake.
This is going good.
I don't know, so... Hey, that notice that was on your door, everything all right?
Like, if you...
You know, if you need anything.
Just let me know.
So...
That guy, Evan, from the club, you know him?
Yeah.
I mean, yeah, I know him.
How do you know him?
Well, I don't, I just...
People were talking about him at the club all night.
I guess he's a pro or something? What, does he fight?
A boxer? Yeah, I mean, a couple, you know, the guys at the club or whatever, we just came back from this...
You know, it's not a professional thing, but... Out in, like, you know, Korea land, we just came from a fight, too.
You know, it went pretty well.
So you're a fighter?
No, I mean, yeah.
But not professional.
Just, you know...
I don't know...
I got this guy, he's an agent/coach sort of thing.
I mean, it's been going pretty good, though.
What?
I don't know.
So how do you know all those guys at the club?
I don't. I...
I don't even know your name, really.
What's your name?
Your last name?
MacArthur.
Shawn MacArthur.
Like a knight.
I like it.
What are you thinking about?
So...
Simple as that.
I can fix this for you.
I want to fix this for you. It's not so bad.
You want to fix it?
Mmm-hmm.
I want to kiss you.
Come on...
Why are you shaking?
Because I lied about being able to sew.
It looks like you're doing a good job.
Look at that mess.
Wow, I am shaking.
Wait, come here for a second.
Give me your finger.
Make a wish.
I got mine, you got yours?
Mmm-hmm.
I do.
Excuse me!
You got to go.
I'm sorry.
Enough is enough.
Please go.
Yes, ma'am.
I believe it's enough for today.
You can meet later today.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Just a second to say bye. No second.
Come in.
You come in.
Thank you so much, Mrs. Valez, I appreciate it.
I'm no Mrs. Valez, I'm Mrs. Guzman. Okay?
And you got to go. Go.
Give me one second to say bye, please.
Oh, my goodness, you give me so much trouble today.
I'm sorry.
She could have come a little bit later, that's for sure.
That would have been nice. Totally.
I know.
Okay, so...
Okay.
Good night, yeah...
So I'm going to see you again?
Yeah.
Yeah. When?
You sleeping?
Who can sleep with all that banging up there?
Told you we'd win, huh?
Did you get our money?
Right at it, huh?
Yes, sir.
Look, I know we already had a fight, but any word on another one?
I just want to make sure we're capitalizing on everything we got going on here.
I told you, if you like, anything I got, the tickets, the hats, the sneakers, you can sell those until I get you another fight, if that's what you want to do.
Go ahead, turn around. Huh?
You wanna get paid, right?
Go ahead, man, get it, I ain't gonna rob you.
I know you're not gonna rob me, 'cause you're gonna turn around.
After tonight, you don't trust me? Okay, fine.
I've turned around.
This is me, all right?
I've turned around, go ahead. Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.
I've turned around, go.
I was with this girl from the club tonight.
Keep looking and you're going to be with her now.
You can turn around now.
Man, she got a daughter.
She's kind of having a little trouble with the rent, I think.
I kinda wanted to help her.
Stop smiling at me, I know what you're going to say.
Yeah, I bet...
Why wouldn't I help her, then?
Beyond the kid and the need for money...
Why you gotta break everything down?
That's your problem, man, you don't trust nobody.
Here you go.
I'm never trusting you, you and your suitcase.
My suitcase?
Yeah, your suitcase don't trust nobody either.
There's $10,000 right here.
Yeah.
Nice, isn't it?
I was right, wasn't I?
Look, I just...
We shouldn't be selling tickets and sneakers no more.
I tell you, we gotta...
This is what we're doing right now.
So...
This girl. She works over at the Marquee?
Yeah, Zulay.
Zulay.
She's nice, man.
Zulay.
Yeah.
Okay.
You get some rest, all right?
There's $10,000 right here. Yeah.
Get some rest, all right?
Hey, you know where Zulay is?
What do you want to talk about?
Isn't there something you should be telling me?
What are you talking about, Harvey?
You're gonna make me say it?
Why didn't you tell me that you were sleeping with him?
Why couldn't you tell me that?
'Cause I don't have to tell you everything. That's why.
Now you want him paying your bills?
I did not ask him to pay my bills.
Are you kidding me?
You're bringing him around your daughter, you like him like that?
What, you think he's better than me, right?
No.
That's...
You think you're better than me, that's why you fill his head with all this garbage.
About riding off into the sunset, like this is a movie or something, huh?
No, no, come here I'm talking to you.
Don't touch me.
I'm talking to you.
Don't touch me.
Stop it.
If he decides to up and leave you tomorrow, you think you're part of his plans?
You think your daughter is?
Maybe.
What about your grandmother?
You're always so paranoid.
Yeah, that's what I am, I'm paranoid.
I'm paranoid.
You still believe in fairy tales.
But you think I'm paranoid, okay.
Does he know how we met?
You in the back seat, sleeping in your car, with your daughter in the front seat?
Is that something to be paranoid about?
Okay.
You think that little thing right here between your legs is gonna make everything okay, don't you?
That's what you think.
It isn't.
You use that on him.
Don't put no more garbage in his head.
Yo, check this out, yo.
Check what out, this dirty-ass crib you got?
There are bare wires laying around, man.
Clean this shit up.
Shut up, bro, I'm about to kick you out.
Evan Hailey KO's Richards. It's your man from the club.
This dude's corny.
No, check it.
A dude like this man, you got to take serious, man.
Yeah, look how he punches.
He look like he's punching like a girl, but those punches hurt, man.
It's your man, Shawn.
Who is that?
That's that dude from the club, bro.
No, man, he's the real deal.
Yo, Shawn, no disrespect, man, he's fighting for real money in real venues.
Shawn over here bullshitting with us.
Look at you, Harvey.
You know, you've been doing that for some time now.
It's called bi-polar or manic depressive.
What?
What?
Oh, my God.
Harvey, come in.
Come in, sit down.
Come in.
We were just talking about you.
Come in, come in.
Special occasion, you got the suit broke out.
Nice suit.
Jacket, at least.
That's nice.
Beautiful, you're looking good.
Not bad, Harvey.
Listen, I didn't come here, you know, to take up a whole lot of your time.
I'm just here to tell you that if you've got something for Shawn...
Look at little Harvey, he's like a little kid.
He's very excited, like he has a secret to share with us.
What's the secret, Harvey?
I'm just saying, if you...
If you got something for us, we're ready to go, you know.
He's the biggest draw in this town, and if you're ready for something, we're ready for it.
Wow.
It must be very hard for you to come in here and grovel in front of all of us here.
Especially Martinez.
You know, Jack, I don't have to stay here and take this from you.
Guess what, Harvey?
We were talking about you and we said that maybe we should put your man in one of our fights.
A big fight. $100,000 to the winner, Harvey.
Harvey's excited, huh, Harvey?
You excited, Harvey?
$100,000.
Evan Hailey's going to rock your boy's world.
Time out.
He couldn't wait to tell you that one.
See, this is the way it's going to be.
Evan Hailey versus Shawn MacArthur.
And we're going to play up this whole thing about how they went to the same school, you know, the education rivalry.
Rivalry for education.
Okay.
I know.
As soon as we get the word out, the phone's just going to ring off the hook.
We'll let both of you know.
Harvey, you sure you're ready for this, Harvey?
Can't help but keep calling my name, huh?
I don't know, Harvey, maybe I'm stupid, you know?
But I'm not stupid enough to think that Shawn's going to win this.
That's stupid, Harvey. Yeah, really.
Really?
You just don't know how good he is, you know?
Yeah, I do.
That's why I got Evan.
And the loser gets shit, Harvey.
And you still get shit.
Hey, man.
We need to take a walk and talk for a second.
Okay.
So you gonna tell me?
Well, I got you another fight.
Yeah?
How much?
$100,000.
What?
Yeah.
They want us to fight Evan Hailey.
He's your opponent.
Great.
I'm taking all my money and I'm placing it against us.
You ain't got no money.
You have any idea how much money I can raise for something like this?
Then raise it and put it on us to win.
People like a guarantee, Shawn.
Then guarantee it.
You saw Jerry, those Wall Street guys, even Martinez would get in on this.
We're talking real money.
No, you're talking about money.
No, come on, Shawn.
What do you think, there's a trophy involved in all of this?
Nobody cares about it.
And if we lose, you know we get nothing.
You get that, right?
What?
Come on, Shawn.
Look, all right, look...
I'm nothing, I get it.
I ain't worth nothing.
Nobody said anything like that.
I mean, come on.
All I'm saying is that I don't want to lose. That's all I'm saying is I don't want to lose.
I'm telling you, Shawn...
Look, I know it sounds stupid to you.
It's stupid.
But that's what I... I don't want to do it, so I won't.
Okay?
Cut all that stuff, man, listen to me.
I mean it.
Listen, listen.
I'm talking to you.
Harvey.
What, you gonna hit me?
No, I'm not gonna hit you...
I'm sorry.
You think I'm your father?
You're going to slap me around like I'm your father, huh?
Okay, okay, I get it.
You think I don't know who you are, Shawn.
What?
I know all about you.
I said, can the moral garbage with me, Shawn.
It don't work here.
Harvey, you don't ever talk about my father, okay?
You gonna hit me?
You don't ever talk about my father.
Hey.
So you came back.
You know me, the stalker.
You caught me taking a shower.
So, what are you doing here?
Nothing, I was just...
I don't know, just kinda wanted to see you.
Okay, well, come in.
My grandmother has Lila, so, come in.
I know it's really hot in here, so, if you want, just grab a seat and I'll be right back.
Hey, listen.
Look, I made some money and I kinda wanted to help you with the notice that I saw on the door the other day.
That's really...
No...
That's sweet, but...
No.
For Lila. No, I don't need it.
Listen, hold on, hold on.
Just for Lila.
Hold on a second.
Just, please, just listen.
I don't know what I'm trying to say...
The last thing I want to do is upset you.
You came in here offering me money.
Just don't...
It's no big deal, okay?
I don't know how to...
What?
Your hair smells good.
Thank you.
You know, when you wash your hair in the sink, they call it a Puerto Rican shower.
My grandfather used to hate when people called it that.
Of course, he can say it.
I like this, this is nice.
I know what happened with your dad.
Is that okay?
I read...
Me and Lila were on the computer, and we just kinda stumbled across...
Wow...
I'm sorry...
No...
Checking up on me?
That's all right.
It's okay?
Yeah.
So you think I'm crazy now?
No.
Well, I mean... You'd be right.
I mean, I did.
I went a little crazy, so...
You know that guy Evan, the other night, at the club, you know, after the whole thing?
Yeah.
We were on the same team and my dad coached us.
Man, he loved Evan.
I was a freshman, and they always used to mess with me.
And I just couldn't take it no more.
I kind of lost it.
And me and Evan went at it. And my dad got between us and I didn't even see him, you know.
I just kinda...
I hit him.
I hit my father.
And I just didn't stop.
You know? I just couldn't stop.
My father never forgave me. 'Cause he shouldn't.
I got to go get that.
Okay, I have to get going because I have to go do something at the club, I realized. I'm sorry.
I have to go and do something at the club that I completely forgot about.
Okay...
Please hurry up.
I'll walk you. I'm hurrying.
We do have to go.
I'm sorry, I just...
Okay. I heard you the first time, I'm going, I'm going.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I just forgot I had to go get this stuff done.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, why?
Just wondering.
You're good?
Yeah.
Hey, Harvey.
Wait.
What? What's going on here?
I was going to tell you, I know Harvey.
Wait, hold on.
You all know each other?
Yeah, I know her.
I know her.
Listen...
Wait, how do you know...
I mean, how do you know each other?
What's going on, 'cause, are you together or something?
No.
Listen, Shawn...
No, no, no...
I'm talking to her...
I'm talking...
No, no, let me...
I just want to hear it from her.
Let me talk to you, okay?
What did I say? I said I'm talking...
What now?
Shawn...
I want to talk to her.
I'm talking to you.
I want to talk to her!
Get your hands off me!
Shut up!
Get your hands off of me!
Get out of my head!
Look, everything isn't what you think.
You're not the only one that worked with me.
She works with me, too.
It's what I was explaining at the apartment.
Nobody knows we know each other.
She places bets for me.
Okay, that's what it is.
I was going to tell you, Shawn.
You asked about my...
You asked about my father.
Shawn...
Why would you do that?
You better learn to answer your phone.
Why didn't you answer? That's all you had to do.
Why did you call?
Why didn't you text me and say something?
Listen, Harvey and I have been friends for a really long time.
Listen to me.
I should have told you, I know that.
I don't know what I might say to you, okay. Wait.
Just listen to me, okay?
Look, I make $11 an hour, okay?
Is that what you want to know?
I make $11 an hour, I'm broke.
I pick up glasses from people that I hate all night long, and I'm not really supposed to be doing this right now.
Why didn't you just tell me that?
Because.
Harvey... We're just friends.
He just gives me this money, and I just go place bets for him and that's all there is to it.
Nobody even knows that we know each other.
Then why couldn't you just say that to me?
Is this thing still on?
Listen, man...
Yeah, I understand.
Throw it.
No one will ever know the better.
And you're going to tell me you're okay with that, huh?
Yeah.
Whatever you raise, I want half.
We ain't talking about anything here, you know.
No, forget it, then.
Okay.
Just like that, though, huh? Yeah.
Just like that.
All right.
Then, you know once you get out there, all those eyes are going to be on you.
And if there's even a hint that you're throwing this thing... And that's both of us dead.
You understand how much money they...
They don't scare me, Harvey.
This city doesn't scare me.
I'm gonna do what you want.
And you're never going to see me again.
None of you.
This isn't tickets, Harvey.
You understand there's $250,000 in this bag.
And, Harvey, don't make us come looking for you.
Nice office, Harvey.
Glad you could make it.
Yeah, you should get a receptionist.
Is he going to listen to you, Harvey?
If you don't believe me, he's right out there, you can ask him yourself.
I'm asking you, Harvey.
There's $250,000 in here.
And if he decides he don't like losing, and by some miracle he wins, I still want my money, Harvey.
I don't get my money, Harvey, I'll kill you.
Lot of money.
Come on in.
Zulay, did you have another dream?
It's a lot of money, Jack. Oh, yeah?
How much are we talking about?
Half a million dollars.
So what are you doing walking around the street with half a million dollars in your bag?
I have investors.
Investors.
If it's too much money, I can...
Too much?
Listen to that.
She's cleaning up the dumpster, now she's in the club.
Tell your rich-ass and your drunk-ass investor friends that I will be happy to pay them off.
And happier not to.
Count it.
The man is here.
Outside.
We need to get everybody out on the terrace so we can do this thing.
People, the show's going to start.
Outside.
You have a nice place here.
Of course.
City Hall, I've got the Woolworth Building.
My meditation room.
Let's go, people.
Look, I'll meet you out.
Let me talk to you for a second.
You know what we're dealing with here, right?
Let's just go.
Let's get it over with.
Look at this, Harvey.
Now you see how far you've come?
Hey, everybody,
Jerry invited us all up here so we could catch a glimpse of his bank account.
That's nice, huh?
Here's to Jerry.
But what the thing is...
I mean, the real shit of this thing is, is what's going on right here.
So, Jerry, right now, you should step off.
And gentlemen, you should step up.
Let's go baby, let's go!
We're going to sit down, people.
And these two gentlemen are going to go toe to toe, blow to blow.
Whatever goes on up here, whatever.
Whatever you do to each other, whatever.
Whatever you say to each other, whatever.
In the words of the late, great, American poet,
Mr. Marvin Gaye,
"Let's get it on!"
Let's go, baby, let's go!
Yeah!
You froze? Huh?
It's a stare-down.
It's the evil eye.
Is that what you gave your old man? Huh?
Knock that smile off his face, let's go!
Yeah, baby!
All right.
Let's play.
Let's play, Shawn.
Show him what you got! Do it!
Do it, baby!
Go on, Shawn!
Yeah!
Get him, Shawn!
Get him!
Get him!
Right here, Shawn.
He's talking shit!
You can't stay there, Shawn!
Oh, shit!
Hey, hey, that's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's enough!
Call it!
That's it!
That's it!
Go on, Shawn!
Get up!
Get up, bro!
Get up!
Get up!
Get out of it!
Get out of it! Get out!
Come on, Shawn!
You got to fight!
Come on!
Get out of it!
Fight!
Come on, Shawn!
Yeah!
No!
No!
Harvey, what's going on, Harvey?
No!
Come on!
Yeah!
Holy shit!
No!
Yeah, boy!
Yeah, Shawn!
Yeah, Shawn!
You got it, Shawn.
Let's start moving, boys.
Yeah!
What up now, bitch?
Harvey, I'd like to shake your hand, man.
You're a dead man.
You're a dead man, Harvey.
Dead man.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What up now, bitch?
Yeah, baby!
I'll need a drink after that, man, right!
Thank you, Evan, you fight like a bitch.
Harvey, we're going out, VIP Harvey, we out of here.
Whoa, there he is!
You're the shit, man.
Yeah, last night was great, man.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks for the ride.
Thanks for being there.
Yo, we're going to the club tonight, kid.
You wanna come?
VIP all night, drinks all night.
Come on.
Let's go.
No, I'm beat up.
VIP, Harvey.
VIP.
VIP, you all be careful.
Well, tonight, show your butt off.
You know, I'd be lying if I didn't say, secretly I wanted you to win.
That's crazy, right?
If I wasn't a dead man, I'd be happy, you know.
But you killed me with that, Shawn.
You know, you do what you do, you know.
Look, Shawn, in a couple of minutes there's going to be some men that's going to come here, and you can't be here when they get here, okay?
Me and Zulay, we put it on us to win.
Yeah.
We knew you'd never go for it, so we didn't say nothing, but...
There's $1 million in there.
Business ready for business, huh?
Business ready.
You taught me that.
Okay.
That's a lot of money in there.
No, I'm not kidding, Shawn.
That's a lot of money.
That's a lot of ihops.
We're going to Birmingham.
Okay...
You know, we're going to go and see my family.
See what's left of it.
You know what I mean?
Maybe stop by Chicago, or something.
On your way to Birmingham, Chicago.
Right. Yeah.
Why don't you come?
So Birmingham is where you're thinking?
Yeah.
It's where I'm from.
Okay, what we should do, then...
Hear me out.
I think we should go past Birmingham to some place warm.
If you're going all the way to Chicago, through Birmingham, whatever... Take it to California.
You know, they've got a whole lot of great opportunities out there.
I've been doing a lot of reading, I'm not giving those people this money.
I don't give...
Unless...
We shouldn't give nobody none of this.
We should just go.
"'I believe in love,' said Grandma,
"I'm going to go to Africa because my boyfriend is there.
"And then I change my mind, maybe.
Because love is beautiful. "
Oh, my God.
It's amazing, Alabama.
Alabama.
Alabama.
All the time, Alabama, Alabama, Alabama.
Would you all shut up already?
You're driving me crazy.
You're making my ears bleed in here.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, no job history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I.-
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
Until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere. - Previously on Burn Notice.
- The people who burned me... got a specialized rifle for a sniper, got him an access card for this building... and sent him to the conference room on the fourth floor.
But we don't know what he was doing in there.
He's scouting a perch, Sam.
I think I found his target.
If you wanna get in her room, now would be the time.
Find anything?
- We hit the jackpot.
There's some familiar faces in here.
I think we're getting close, Mikey.
There are things in the works that are far, far over your head.
Stay out of them, or there will be consequences.
There are cops here, and they're arresting your brother.
It's a setup.
She's gonna have her sniper take his target out now.
I can get home, get that access card, I can get to the sniper before he takes a shot.
I got some news.
Sniper's dead.
Someone booby-trapped his front door, Mikey.
When you're a spy, you learn to live with the idea... of people wanting you dead- an old enemy, a dissatisfied employer, a disgruntled asset.
Work long enough, and the line to kill you gets pretty long.
- Mike. Mike!
- Still, getting blown up... isn't really something you get used to.
- Don't try it.
Don't try that.
- You just took a pretty bad fall.
Uh, make that a very bad fall.
Here, Mike.
I think your car saved your life, Mike.
Not the first time.
Been out for about 20 minutes.
I got here as soon as I could.
Watch your head.
Either someone's very interested in waterfront storage containers, or they're here to pay you a visit.
Get your seat belt on, Mikey.
Sam.
Brace yourself, Mikey.
- Oh, Mike, steady.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Sam, I'm sorry about the car.
Yeah.
It's just I- I put a lot of love into it.
Well, it's pretty identifiable now.
Yeah, I know.
I just need a sec to grieve here.
All right, look. You think we should be out here?
I mean, maybe we should get you to a hospital.
We gotta keep moving.
When you're being hunted, paranoia is inevitable.
If you don't know what to do with it, it turns into cold, directionless fear.
With the right training, it turns into hyperawareness of your surroundings.
Not always pleasant, but a lot more useful.
Hey, hey, hey.
You seem a little unsteady.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
So, Mike, who do you think was in those cars?
Probably Carla's guys.
Whatever's going on, my guess is she needs to talk to me.
She had Nate arrested.
What?
Are you serious?
I got a call from my mom right before I talked to you.
Hold on.
Distinguishing between different kinds of suspicious behavior... is crucial for an operative.
Surveillance?
Not surveillance, Sam.
Someone doing surveillance, for example, looks different than someone who's trying to commit suicide.
No!
Let me- Please, man.
Let's just start with your name.
What's your name? It's Kenny.
Kenny.
You wanna tell me why you were trying to kill yourself?
It's my son, Jack, okay?
He needs the money.
I was just trying to
- Just forget it, okay?
- Mike, we should keep moving.
I don't know how much longer-
- In a sec. Listen, I really need to go.
You gonna be all right?
You're not gonna be okay.
What's up with him?
He's just looking for some friends of mine.
Who are you?
I still don't understand.
I'm someone who might be able to help you with your problem.
You know, you look like you're in pretty bad shape yourself.
Just tell me about your son, Jack.
He's six, and he's got a heart problem since he was born.
And it's getting worse.
He, uh, might not make it.
How does getting hit by a bus help that?
There's a treatment center in Arizona that looks like... it might be able to help him, but I can't afford it.
Few months ago, I, uh-
- I blew all my money on a scam.
- A scam?
Yeah. I met a lady in a pharmacy, and she told me her kid had the same thing, but he got cured.
250 grand later, it looked like it was working, until the doctor vanished, and it turned out to be pep pills mixed with a painkiller.
It just made Jack worse.
So I-
I left a note for the babysitter, and I-
I went out to get the money.
From the first day of training, you're told not to get emotionally involved in operations.
But sometimes it happens, and there's nothing you can do.
Give me whatever you have that's connected to the people that did this.
I will get you your money back.
Get my money back?
Seriously?
How?
By any means necessary.
This is insane.
It's done, Sam.
It's irresponsible.
You're raising this guy's hopes, not to mention you were almost killed.
You got surveillance everywhere.
Your brother's in jail. You got plenty going on.
Then some guy walks in front of a bus-
I didn't make him walk in front of the bus, Sam.
You were looking for this.
I know you.
If it wasn't this guy, it'd be somebody else walking down the street.
I'm running on fumes, Sam.
This is all I got.
I can help this guy.
All right, Mike.
I get it.
Oh, look.
There's our surveillance car.
Just like I said.
Come on.
Mike, let's go.
I'm not running.
Oh, you're not gonna-
Oh, you are gonna-
You're gonna bring me in?
Let me help.
You gotta unlock the door.
It's on the handle.
Push.
Push.
There you go.
Jackass.
- Michael.
- Carla.
New office.
I like it.
- What the hell was that today?
- You're asking me?
Last time I checked, you put my brother in jail, you chased me halfway across Miami and you nearly got my head blown off.
- We had nothing to do with that.
- Nothing?
Your sniper got blown up the same way.
By the way, how'd the assassination go?
An operation was compromised.
Which is why you're holed up in an office with two guys and a bag of Cheetos.
- Tell me.
Why am I here?
- You were told to stay out of our business.
Well, clearly, you didn't think I would do what I was told... because you went to a lot of trouble to keep me busy.
We need to know what happened.
If you're playing some kind of a game-
I am flattered that you think I'm that devious, but I didn't blow myself up for your benefit.
I want my brother out of jail!
I want answers!
I want my life back!
We'll be in touch.
Get him out of here.
Whatever blew you up was pretty substantial.
If you'd have opened the door any wider, we'd be picking up little itty-bitty pieces of you.
Can you check the chemical traces, see what kind of explosives they used?
Sure.
Michael, I do admire you, getting right back to work, but you did almost die yesterday.
You wanna call the guy, say, "Sorry about your kid, but I got a lot going on right now"?
Find anything in the medical records, Sam?
Well, I cross-checked the clinics and the pharmacy records, and it looks like our scammers got their lead through a clinic in Coral Gables.
Probably have a source there tipping 'em off.
Sounds about right.
- How do you wanna play it, Mike?
- How's your liver feeling?
We don't have any appointments for several weeks.
But if you want, you could always try calling other clinics-
I've been calling.
I've been to every clinic in town.
It's liver damage, for Christ's sake.
How complicated can it be?
I understand, sir.
Oh, please.
Ma'am, I am in P-A-I-N, okay?
Let's get something going here.
Sir
- No, no, no.
That really won't be necessary.
I'll see if we can fit you in.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, man. Modern-day health care.
Whoo! I'm sorry, sir.
I couldn't help but overhear.
You said you're having liver trouble?
Yeah.
Damn thing's falling apart.
Have you heard of Apatadine?
It's an experimental drug out of Europe.
Did wonders for my father.
Medical scammers- like pimps, drug dealers or feral dogs- need to protect their territory.
They can't let anyone new operate there, or they're asking for problems.
I actually - I have some in my car.
Sign me up.
Like a corporation has a lawyer to handle copyright infringement, a scammer will often have an enforcer to deal with unwanted competition.
It says, "Take one to two tablets by mouth every four hours as needed. "
And here's my number if you have any questions.
That's very nice.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
- Appreciate it.
- Good luck.
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?
Who the hell are you?
Get out of here.
This is a public place.
I have every right.
- Do you want a problem?
- Is that a gun? I'll call the police.
Then what?
You gonna sell 'em some pills?
There's already somebody working this place. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's the problem here?
- You with her? - Yeah.
We're sorry.
We didn't mean to move in on your score.
Look, there's plenty of money to be made in that clinic, right?
Maybe we can work together.
What's your name?
As a spy, the best approach... is usually to become a target's friend. It's Todd.
I'm Donnie.
Good to meet you.
Uh, I'm a lefty.
Sorry.
Whoo! Some situations, though, call for a different approach.
Subtle.
Empty commercial buildings are useful... when you're looking for a place to interrogate someone.
No one pays much attention to people coming and going, and the floors are typically soundproof.
Used to be some kind of gallery.
My buddy's the building manager.
They're gonna remodel in a couple of months.
But for now, got the whole place to ourselves.
This is perfect, Sam.
Looks like your pal's waking up. Just sit tight.
Be with you in a bit.
Securing a room isn't about walls.
A determined captive can kick through plasterboard, but he can't bite through steel bars or pry out screws with his fingers- though it might be fun to watch him try.
You're sure about this treatment in Arizona?
I mean, as sure as I can be.
- You go ahead and make the arrangements.
- What?
You got the money back?
You serious?
Not yet.
But I will.
Listen.
I appreciate you trying.
But, uh, I really don't think you know what you're up against.
You just call the treatment center, you sign Jack up and make plane reservations.
Okay.
I just got a lot of stuff to put in order.
I need to find someplace to put Jack.
I know someone who can babysit.
You're doing a job?
What about your brother?
He's sitting in a jail cell, Michael.
I'm handling it. Yeah?
You almost got yourself killed.
I'm handling it.
Will you do this favor for me, please?
Hi there, sweetheart.
What do you say you and I go find some toys for you to play with?
Would you like that?
What kind of toys?
Michael's old toys.
Most of them are blown up or taken apart.
But I bet we could find a few good ones.
Want to?
Let's go.
That's a good boy.
I got it. Thank you.
Michael, what am I supposed to do here exactly?
Someone came after me with a bomb.
I don't want that happening here.
I was supposed to meet Campbell.
I'm spread a little thin right now, Fi.
- What do you want?
- You guys got a great little scam going down here.
- We want in.
- What do you want, a job application?
You're good.
You're a funny guy, Todd.
"Job application. "
You know how it is when you get to a new area.
You got to do a little research, know the competition, the business environment.
So... tell me all about your little business, starting with your coworkers.
Get outta my face.
I got nothing to say to you.
Nothing?
That's disappointing.
There's a saying in interrogation:
"Violence perceived is violence achieved. "
You don't want someone screaming.
You want him asking questions, asking "What is he doing with that knife?"
Now, why would you wanna disappoint me like that?
That hurts me.
That hurts me like this.
Asking, "If he'll do that to himself, what will he do to me?"
That is a sharp knife.
Mostly you want him asking, "How do I make this stop?"
What do you want?
Stop!
I just want to know about your business.
There's nothing to know.
I worked with this guy a couple times.
He said he had this medical scam.
They needed some muscle, so they brought me in.
That's it.
Tell me about this guy.
Yeah.
Mike, I think we got something.
Guy named Philip.
Hangs out at a bar in South Beach named Teasey's.
Nice work, Sam.
Thanks.
I gotta get some Band-Aids.
Nearly getting killed shakes you up... no matter how much experience you have.
Brushes with death are like snowflakes.
Each one is unique and icy cold.
Kenny, it's Michael.
I need you to meet me tomorrow.
I need a little help finding someone.
Now, when you see him, just point him out to me, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Calm down.
The guy sold fake medicine to my kid, you know.
I know.
Breathe.
- That's him.
- All right.
Which one?
Guy with - Kenny!
Hey!
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Man - Come on.
How's that feel, huh?
You like that? You need some medicine?
All right. You wanna kill him, or you want me to solve your problem?
Don't answer that.
Just go back to the car.
Go.
Never?
You're sure?
Yes.
I don't know who they are.
Guy said he wanted in on a scam.
And you told them where I was, how to find me?
- What the hell were you thinking?
- He had a knife.
You think I'm gonna get cut up just to keep your name out of it?
- I had no choice.
- They were with that guy Kenny.
The one with the little kid.
You know anything about that?
Maybe they tried to rip him off too.
I told you, I don't know.
Could they be cops?
They're not cops.
That I know.
Did you tell them about-
No, man.
Of course not.
Keep it that way, 'cause that bitch will kill us in a second.
You trust me.
I've seen what she can do.
We got more to worry about from her than we do from these guys, whoever they are.
Yeah, Mike, I think we finally got something we can use.
There's a boss.
She sounds like a hard case.
Good.
I'll be right over.
It's time to play "Who talks first. "
Mike, are you sure?
You know I don't like doing that kind of stuff.
Mike?
All righty then.
Just tell us who you are, what you want.
We can work this out.
Hey, you want in on the scam, huh?
Let's talk.
We'll cut you in.
It's good money.
What do you want?
I got five grand, cash, back at my place.
It's yours.
Just- Shut up!
The "who talks first" interrogation technique... originally involved taking two blindfolded prisoners up in a helicopter... and tossing one out to get the other to talk.
Jesus!
When a helicopter's not available, any tall building will do.
What is this?
We're gonna have a little conversation.
One of you is gonna tell me all about your boss.
And the other one is gonna go out the window.
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Yeah, but you-
Shut up!
So, who's feeling talkative?
You?
How about you?
Okay, guys, last chance to volunteer.
Anybody?
Anybody at all?
Okay.
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.
You don't actually wanna kill anyone, of course.
Their screaming is all you really need.
Rachel!
Her name is Rachel, okay?
Rachel! The boss's name is Rachel!
Oh, God - You - Todd-
Todd is gone, Philip.
Todd has left the building.
- Tell me about Rachel.
- I was working a scam up in Fort Lauderdale.
- She found me up there. - Mm-hmm.
Uh-uh. Stay focused.
She works clinics all over town.
What do you want?
I want you to call her, set up a meeting.
Tell her you met some new talent, some folks you think she should know.
Yeah?
Right?
Yeah.
So I've been working through the paperwork to get him into the program, and they're asking for-
- You'll have the money.
- Okay. How?
I'm meeting with Rachel later.
Uh, Mike gets her going on a new scam, something we can take to the cops.
Now you hold that over her head, she'll cough up the money.
Hello.
Hello, Michael.
There's a car waiting for you in the street.
Apparently, I have a meeting.
Go.
Uh, I'll handle it, brother.
This happens all the time.
Anytime now.
- Drugstore sells blindfolds now.
- Just old-fashioned, I guess.
We have a new job for you.
Really?
'Cause last we spoke, I got the sense I wasn't up for employee of the month.
Something change?
I think you're gonna like this job.
We want you to try and find whoever it was that tried to kill you.
- Oh, like a lead investigator.
- Something like that.
And if that doesn't work, you're hoping... they'll take another shot at me and expose themselves.
Point is, someone out there wants you dead, and we both need to know who.
Michael, we don't wanna lose our new operative, and I'm assuming you don't wanna lose your life.
Get my brother out of jail.
We can do that.
He'll be released after his arraignment on Thursday.
Is that all?
'Cause I have someplace to go.
Yes. Your side job.
Say hi to all the desperate little people for me, huh?
I think he could use some company.
What?
I'm new to the babysitting thing.
Do I sing songs or-
There's no point in pretending that you're Mary Poppins.
It's just not in you.
Just be yourself.
Go with what you know.
Hey.
Hey.
- You wanna play army men?
- Okay.
Hey, my guy has an M2 Browning .50 caliber.
It's a belt-fed weapon, so it's big and hard to hide.
But it's got good range though.
So I think he would shoot from up here.
Let me see your guy. Hmm.
Okay.
Your guy has a Mark II... pineapple fragmentation grenade, short-range.
So he needs a really, really good hiding place.
In the flowerpot?
Let's see if we can get you some more tactical support.
Hello.
Fi, it's me.
Hey, Michael.
How'd the meeting go?
I've been officially hired... to find the guy that tried to kill me.
- Uh, Fi, you need to-
- I'll be there in a bit.
We're playing army men.
Binoculars.
For the truly security conscious, there's no better meeting place than a pool of water.
Even if you manage to hide a bug in your swim trunks, chlorinated water conducts electricity well enough to short out any listening device.
You're Rachel?
- Kate?
- My associate Donnie.
Yeah.
Rachel.
Good to meet you.
Philip said you had an opportunity.
He sounded impressed.
Listen, we don't have to compete with each other.
You work mostly terminal cases?
They're simpler.
The folks we deal with, they're gonna be around for a while.
Taking a lot of pills for the rest of their lives.
- Lot of money there.
- We can work together.
You find a prospect for us, you steer them our way.
We find some on the way out, they're all yours.
- Nobody walks away, we both win.
- Sounds interesting.
We just wanna operate here without stepping on your toes.
We just wanna be friends.
All right.
To friendship.
Donnie, be a sweetheart and get the check.
Rachel and I need to talk.
I'm curious.
Yeah?
What is the age mix on your marks? Hmm.
Older mostly.
Hmm. But the kids are where the real money is.
I mean, parents will shell out whatever it takes, no matter how hopeless it is, and that's a score.
And when it's over, half the time they thank you, and they're hugging you, crying, and you're thinking, "You just paid for my house in Keystone Island. "
In covert work, you try to make friends with the bad guys.
- But sometimes you just can't pull it off.
- Once it's clear you're not going to be friends,
- Who are you, huh?
you have to resolve the situation... as quickly and as cleanly as possible.
Sometimes you can't pull that off either.
Sorry.
She was talking.
I just kept thinking about Jack, and I - I - I couldn't help it.
It's not your fault.
I'm mad at myself.
Go back to my mom's house, make sure everything's okay there.
- What are you gonna do?
- What I have to.
Any luck finding Rachel?
No.
Talked to my fed buddies.
Had 'em run a trap and trace.
But she uses a dial-back system out of Eastern Europe for that phone.
So we're not finding her then?
Not that way, Mike.
Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna get the money.
- What are you talkin' about?
Rachel's not-
Not Rachel.
From Carla.
She's offered cash before.
Mike, come on.
You don't even know where to find her. I'll buy a plane ticket leaving Miami.
She'll find me soon enough.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You and I both know this is a bad idea.
You take Carla's money, and she's got her hooks into you.
What else can I do, Sam?
I promised I'd get the money.
There's no other way.
I wanna save this kid too, but I'm not gonna let you do this.
Look, I know it's been rough on you, so I understand that you're a little edgy.
Move, Sam.
Move.
Not bad, Mike.
Now, you can hit me all you want.
But I'm gonna stand here till you get your head back in the game.
That's all she said.
House on Keystone Island.
That's a lot of houses there.
It's a nice neighborhood, but we'd be knocking on doors for a month.
We have her phone number.
You think I could lure her out?
No.
She's careful.
She's smart.
If she follows her instinct, she's gonna lay low.
What do you wanna do, Mike?
Fi, can you get your boyfriend to lend us his ambulance tomorrow?
He's got an idea.
See? I knew it.
I knew he'd come through.
He hits me in the mouth a couple times and he gets an idea.
Can you do it, Fi?
Michael.
If I ask Campbell one more time
- Please.
I'm not asking for me.
Using sound to determine an enemy's position... is one of the oldest techniques in war, whether it's putting an ear to the ground... or bouncing sonar off a submarine.
If you can get your enemy on the phone, that opens up new possibilities.
Hook up your cell phone to an amplifier and a computer that can analyze sound, and you have a powerful weapon if you know how to use it.
- I think we're good to go.
- Oh, I think we are too.
Here we go.
Look, Fiona, we need to talk. Yeah.
When Michael's on the phone, you drive down the street with the siren on.
- We use the sound to- - I know.
I know.
That's not what I meant.
Look, Fiona, you're a great girl.
I mean, you're exciting and you're passionate.
- I just don't think I can take this.
- Campbell-
You and Mike, I know you have a history.
But he's your boyfriend.
- Not me.
- No, he's not.
You're-
I'm a guy you fool around with and you borrow ambulances from.
He's the most important thing in your life.
That's him, isn't it?
You know, it's okay.
I know you're always gonna answer when he calls.
It's time, Fi.
Let's go.
Running an operation is like poker.
Ideally, you've got good cards and you play them well.
When your cards are bad, though, you have to know how to bluff.
Yeah, Rachel.
Yeah, yeah.
It's Donnie.
What do you want?
You pissed off my boss pretty bad yesterday.
She wanted me to call you with a new offer.
A new offer?
Yeah.
You settle with us for 250 grand and you clear out of Miami.
You want a quarter million dollars, or what?
Or your little girlfriend's gonna come after me again?
I'll take my chances.
Keep laughing.
There's an ambulance coming down your street, Rach.
You know what it's for?
I called that ambulance for your guys.
You know, Todd and Philip.
You wanna say good-bye to 'em?
- Say good-bye to Rach.
Get us out of here, Rachel!
Ooh, I don't think that ambulance is gonna get here in time.
250 grand and you clear out, or you're next.
Forget it.
You're not getting anything.
Suit yourself, Rach.
I'm coming for you.
See you soon.
Fi, tell me you got that.
In modern warfare, a well-positioned microphone... can tell you anything from where troops are moving to where a sniper is firing from.
The same basic technology will also tell you... when an ambulance passes someone talking on a cell phone.
Got it, Michael.
Looks like we're in business.
- Thanks, Sam.
- You'd do the same for me, man.
Hi there.
Look who's back.
You want 250 grand?
I can do that.
Yeah, that offer expired.
She's all excited about shooting you now.
- You don't wanna do this.
Don't waste your time.
When she gets like this-
As long as you're on the street, we got a problem.
Trust me, it's simpler this way.
- Oh, there's gotta be another way.
- We can make a deal.
- We can't take the risk.
Unless somebody's dead or in jail, she gets itchy.
Okay, wait.
Wait.
What if I go to jail?
Jail?
Oh, think about it.
I'm outta your way. There's a half a million dollars in this house.
It's yours.
- Don't look at me.
She's the boss.
- It's simpler this way.
- Yeah, I hear you, but it's messy.
The wall, we'd have to clean it up.
Besides, we could use the start-up money.
Fine.
Phone.
- Money.
- Dial first.
You figure we can't shoot you after we call the cops.
- Yeah.
Smart, this one.
Real smart.
It's in the cabinet, behind the liquor bottles.
I need to speak to the police.
I wanna report a crime.
Uh, yeah, I'll hold.
Oh, and this confession?
Make it convincing.
- Because the day you get out of jail-
You serious?
Th-That's all for Jack?
It's a little more than you need for the treatment.
Take the rest.
Start a college fund.
What happened to, uh- Rachel?
She confessed to an impressive list of scams.
She won't be around for a while.
Cops found Todd and Philip hog-tied behind a Miami police station.
I - I don't know what to say.
I'm glad I could help.
Oh. And, uh, thank your friend too.
'Cause Jack can't stop talking about her.
He, uh - He drew this.
That's, uh, you and her together.
Tell him thanks.
You'll find another boyfriend.
Not like Campbell.
He was sweet and cute.
He had other impressive qualities.
I'm sorry.
Are you?
I want you to be happy.
I got the chemical analysis back from the explosion.
Shaped charge.
Professional.
However, they couldn't go out the front door after they set it.
If they went off the balcony
- I could check the security cameras... at the businesses along the river.
You're really gonna do this?
Hunt them down? Worth a try.
The enemy of my enemy could be my friend.
It's from Jack.
Thanks again, Fi.
Hello, Michael.
Carla.
- You're here.
- I helped myself to a yogurt.
I hope you don't mind.
Funny thing.
I poisoned all my yogurts just in case you came by.
Even you aren't that good.
Part of you- a little part of you- is wondering if I am.
I see you bought a new door.
Any progress finding our bomber?
Nope.
Checked the blast.
Crude I.E.D. Amateur hour.
We recruited you because you're a good liar.
Guess we can't complain too much when you lie to us. Hmm?
But know this.
One way or another, I expect results.
Understand?
Loud and clear.
Good.
Doing your own errands?
It's not like you.
Exceptional times call for exceptional measures.
When you've spent enough time as an operative, recovering from a brush with death... isn't about an appointment with the psychiatrist or a week in Hawaii.
It's about having a purpose, whether it's something to fight or someone to hunt.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
When you're burned, you've got nothing.
No cash, no credit, no job history.
You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.
- Should we shoot them?
An old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI.
You know spies...
A bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family, too...
- Hey, is that your mom again?
Until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
Previously on Burn Notice
Someone out there wants you dead, and we both need to know who.
You're gonna do this?
Hunt them down?
The enemy of my enemy could be my friend.
I got the chemical analysis back from the explosion.
Professional.
Any progress finding our bomber?
Nope.
Checked the blast. Crude IED. Amateur hour.
We recruited you because you're a good liar.
I guess we can't complain when you lie to us.
They couldn't go out the door after they set it.
If they went off the balcony...
I could check the security cameras at the businesses along the river.
When you work for an intelligence agency, you operate within an official structure.
There's a chain of command to report to, protocols to be observed.
No one questions their mission.
But when you freelance, you don't have those luxuries.
Getting your team on board may require some convincing.
I don't have a problem with hunting down someone who planted a bomb at your place.
I have a problem with why you're hunting him.
If this was revenge, I'd be fine.
- Revenge is a waste of time.
- So is watching TV and eating candy.
You do it 'cause it feels good.
You are finding a killer for the people who ruined your life.
When I find him, I'll have more on them.
Intelligence gathering.
Right.
He should at least suffer a little.
When I find him, there will be some pain involved.
Are you happy?
Delighted.
Do you see that storage facility?
It has security cameras that cover the approach to your loft from the road.
Here's the name of the service rep who installed the security system.
And the model number.
You're welcome.
You do care.
Now run along before I change my mind.
Spies love technology upgrades.
When someone replaces old equipment, a computer, a cellphone, a PDA, Getting information becomes as easy as looking through the trash.
I cannot believe Phil didn't call you.
I was up on an install up in Boca.
They had me come down here and do your upgrade.
I got the paperwork right here.
- Is it gonna take long?
- No, it shouldn't be long.
It's just a simple switch-out of a unit.
I should check with them.
No, you should yell at them.
I'm gonna get started here.
When you need to steal information in a hurry, just arrange the technology upgrade yourself.
Ron, it's Kay, at Evergreen.
There's a guy doing an upgrade, but I don't have him on the schedules.
Hang on.
I'm with Ron Lummer.
He needs to speak to you.
- Yeah, Ron?
- Yeah.
Who is this?
No, no, no.
You're looking in the wrong files.
It's Evergreen Storage.
On your desk by the bobble-head guy.
What?
I don't have a file.
- You found it?
- What?
Yeah. Oh, it looks like Phil dropped the ball on this one.
I'm calling the police now.
No, no. Don't be too hard on him.
Everybody makes mistakes.
You're breaking the law.
Don't touch anything.
You know me. Anything for you.
Just save me a donut!
This isn't funny!
You hear me?
You're going to jail!
I'm...
- What did he say?
- Someone's in trouble, but it ain't me.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
If you need to buy a few seconds in an office environment, programming a computer to dial every phone in an office simultaneously is simple and cheap.
Just set up your cellphone to trigger the call remotely.
Sounds like you guys are busy.
To get away clean from an office, it's okay to run.
People run out of offices all the time.
If the look on your face says "I'm in a hurry," you can go as fast as you want.
It's all about covering ground before the yelling starts.
Hey! Hey, stop!
The one you love is closer than you think.
What's yours say?
The one who burned you is closer than you think.
What?
What?
- That got your attention.
- Not funny, Fi.
Is this what your life's become, Michael?
Running around like Carla's errand boy?
I'm doing this so I can get out from under Carla.
The guy who blew me up...
She hates him.
So I would like to meet him.
I think I found something.
Passed the camera twice in 90 minutes the day of the bombing.
Right time, too.
Collapsible ladder for getting down from your balcony.
City worker outfit keeps people from asking questions.
Meet the man who tried to kill me.
Season 2, Episode 11 :
Hot Spot.
Synchro VO :
S@lomon
{\pos(192,215)} - What were you expecting?
- I don't know.
After all this, like, boots and a mask, at least.
You know, a cape, maybe?
{\pos(192,230)}His gear is from city of Miami public works.
{\pos(192,215)}Capes aren't standard issue.
{\pos(192,215)}Fi's checking it out.
{\pos(192,215)}Hey, good news.
{\pos(192,215)}Something to take your mind off all this.
{\pos(192,215)}I got a way to score some Dolphins tickets.
{\pos(192,215)}
- Sam... - Come on, Mikey.
{\pos(192,215)}When's the last time you did something that regular people do?
Don't be afraid.
I'll be right there with you.
{\pos(192,230)}50-yard line, third row, beer in big plastic cups.
{\pos(192,230)} - How are we getting these tickets?
- Buddy of mine, Sean Martin.
{\pos(192,230)}He used to play for the 'phins in the '90s.
He... He needs a little favor.
- And there it is.
- Come on.
{\pos(192,230)}Look, we can probably wrap this up in a day.
We're supposed to meet him at 2:00.
Most of these guys I handpicked in the roughest part of overtown.
{\pos(192,230)}Pulled them out of broken families, gangs. Put them on the field.
{\pos(192,215)}See, Mike?
He's a great humanitarian, he's got tickets on the 50-yard line.
{\pos(192,215)}Sam said you had a problem.
{\pos(192,215)}Not me.
{\pos(192,215)}One of my players, Corey Jensen.
{\pos(192,215)}Good kid.
Stays out of trouble, but he got into a fight the other day.
- A fight?
What about? - Not sure.
I just know the guy he fought is bad news.
Felix Cole, a local gangster.
Word is, he wants Corey dead.
Gangster...
This is the little problem you...
Yeah. Hey, Sean, what exactly were you hoping for here, favor-wise?
He's at my place with his sister.
I just wanted you guys to go by and talk to him and see what the options are.
Well, if he's being hunted, he shouldn't be staying at your place.
Won't be long before they look there.
Mike's right.
Look, let me swing by. I'll pick them up.
{\pos(192,215)}Thanks, Sam.
I appreciate it.
{\pos(192,215)}Okay, so it's not a little problem, {\pos(192,215)}but we're not exactly talking nosebleed seats either here, huh?
Come on.
{\pos(192,215)}Whoa, Mike. We got a visitor.
{\pos(192,215)}Hello, Michael.
{\pos(192,215)}Is now a good time?
Carla. So great to see you.
You might want to give Sam your keys.
We need to talk.
{\pos(192,215)} - I'll meet you back at the loft.
- You sure, Mike?
He's sure.
{\pos(192,215)}Don't I get tied to the chair?
Don't go soft on me now, Carla.
I thought we'd keep this meeting a little more casual.
We want to know how your investigation is going.
"We"? Who's "we"?
- Love to meet them, if they're around!
- Michael, sit down.
We got our analysis back of the explosives at your place.
Same method and materials used on the other operatives that were attacked.
"Operatives".
Plural.
How many exactly?
Do I get names?
I thought you weren't going to tie my hands.
I've seen your work.
You do just fine with your hands tied.
Everything I can share with you is here.
And it stays here.
Look it over, let us know when you're done.
What if I have to go to the little boys room?
Well, you're gonna have to hold it.
My men have orders to shoot you if you try to leave the room. Hey, Mike. Well, that was a quickie.
You look... unbruised.
Just a few paper cuts.
I got a look at Carla's files.
She thinks the bomber is not local.
So the big, bad burn-notice lady's a step behind you.
You think it's gonna stay that way?
Well, I asked for a list of all demolition experts who have spent time in Serbia and Montenegro.
Said I saw a pattern there.
- We got another meeting on the books.
- Nice.
Fi's upstairs with the kids.
I'm just heading out to get dinner for everybody.
- Pizza time? - Yeah.
Mike, just a heads-up.
This one has Fi a little... fired up.
Sorry. I was delayed.
Oh, that's okay, Michael.
I was getting to know your guests.
I'm Corey.
This is my little sister, Tanya.
- Hi. I'm Michael.
- Nice to meet you.
They told me about their situation.
It seems this...
Man... Felix?
He took Tanya for a ride in his car and then he attacked her.
And she escaped, barely, and then Corey went after him with a baseball bat.
I found her crying.
I just wanted to make sure he never tried to come back...
No explanation necessary.
Use a golf club next time.
Greater force to a smaller area.
But now he's after me.
His guys came to my house.
They tried to shoot me in the street.
- I mean, I don't know where to go.
- It's fine.
- We'll take care of it.
- Would you excuse me?
Could I talk with you out on the balcony?
Michael, I'm gonna say this once.
We are helping these kids.
- Fi, this is a job for the police.
- Oh, sure.
If we let Felix kill Corey, we'll have more evidence when he comes after this girl again.
You made your point.
We can get them out of town.
No. They've done nothing wrong.
They're not going anywhere.
That son of a bitch is going somewhere, and this is not a discussion.
You're letting your emotions get the best of you.
No. I'm doing better than that.
I'm letting my feelings run the show, and I feel very strongly about this!
Felix works out of that club, mostly.
His crew boosts cars for the 24k syndicate.
That's him next to the GTO.
Man, what was I thinking?
He's a stone-cold gangster.
{\pos(192,275)}He doesn't deserve to be called a gangster.
Anyone who attacks a 15-year-old is a pervert.
It's just... See, the thing is, ever since the word went out, his whole gang is after me.
The whole 24k crew.
The whole 24k crew.
Oh, this is getting better and better.
You see that guy he's talking to?
The guy with the glasses by the table?
That's Tony Soto, the boss.
{\pos(192,275)}Felix earns a lot of money for that guy.
{\pos(192,275)}Any car that gets boosted from here to midtown, it's his guys.
Listen, seriously, I don't think there's anything you guys can do.
Oh, don't worry, Corey.
There's a long list of things we can do.
You know, just for the record, when I said "favor", I was thinking, like, find somebody's lost dog or something like that.
You're gonna have to work a little harder than you're used to.
I work plenty hard, lady.
I just make it look easy.
Corey's up against an organization here, Fi.
Felix is well-connected.
Well, then we'll just have to disconnect him, won't we?
Tony won't back Felix if we put him out of business.
A new gang of car thieves is coming to town.
You want to take him head-on?
Well, then we got to stash Corey and his sister somewhere for a bit.
Corey and Tanya are getting settled, and I'm making spaghetti.
- Excuse me.
- Ma, I'm sorry.
Fiona really felt strongly about them being in a nicer environment than the loft, and...
Well, you know, she was really not in the mood to discuss the point.
It's fine.
If you didn't bring people over, I'd never see you.
And thank you for what you did for your brother.
- For...
For what? - Your brother's papers.
When he got out of jail?
The arrest was erased, like it never happened.
- You didn't do that?
- Not exactly.
It was... It was done for me.
Thank your friends for me, then.
Yeah, my friends put him in jail in the first place, actually, so...
Sometimes I forget how complicated your life is.
There's a reason armies wear uniforms, even though they make them easier to spot. Sometimes that's what you want.
Uniforms suggest organization, power, and numbers.
These, in turn, inspire fear.
And as any good operative knows, there's no more effective weapon than fear.
Nice car.
It's too bad, really.
What's too bad?
Pepper grenades are used by antiterrorist units to disable and stun.
Not lethal, but a face full of pepper gas will keep you pretty busy.
No, no, no. Don't go anywhere.
The party's just starting.
What the hell, man?
Melting through the engine block of a car isn't hard if you know what you're doing.
A few pounds of thermite in a coffee can and a fuse will do the trick and put on a pretty good show.
Felix, over here.
It's time for you to leave Miami.
You what?
You did that to his car?
He's gonna come after you.
Better than him coming after you.
We're just sending him a message.
It's time for him to move on.
Yeah, sounds like it.
Damn.
Oh, I looked through those pictures Mr. Axe gave to me.
- You recognize anyone?
- Yeah, this dude here is JB.
He's definitely big-time.
That's Rodrick.
And this dude here? They call Reed.
These three are Felix's main boosters.
I found some crackers.
Mom?
These are like cardboard.
They were in the back of the cupboard.
They're a few years old.
Corey's been helping me clean out all of the old food in the house.
He ate a can of smoked oysters that I've had since you were a baby.
A little salty, but they really hit the spot.
- Thanks, Ms. Westen.
- Oh, no. Thank you.
- Can we go home now?
- Not yet.
This was a good first step, but we still have to be careful.
Is there any family that you have that Felix might know about?
It's just me and Tanya.
Our mom passed last year.
We got family up north.
But I need to finish school here.
I got a chance at a scholarship.
Coach Martin looks after us if we need it.
Well, I think it's time to talk to coach Martin.
The whole neighborhood's talking about what happened with Felix yesterday.
The engine of his car melted into the road?
It's crazy.
Well, crazy's kind of what you want in a situation like this.
I mean, you want Felix to worry about something that's bigger than some kid beating him up.
Sounds like a plan to me.
If there's anything I can do to help.
Actually, I need you to keep your head down for a while, 'cause this is gonna get worse before it gets better.
Sam, you're asking me to hide?
Hide? Oh, no.
Of course not.
I just need you to be someplace where no one can see you.
Until I give the all-clear.
You know, for the kids.
When you need to get into a building in a hurry, you can always count on a fire exit.
Every building has them.
It's just about knowing how to use them.
The right shape charge will put a big enough dent in a steel door to disengage the lock, which can turn a fire exit into a convenient and unexpected entrance.
A coil of detcord attached to a rubber mat will give you the explosion you need and allow you to point it wherever you need it to go.
SWAT teams call it a hockey puck.
Let me do that.
I have a more delicate touch.
I made some progress finding your would-be assassin today.
There's a chance he works at ASA Dismantling.
The city contracts their demolition work with them.
I think I'll pay him a visit, see what I can find out.
It's beautiful.
Beautiful.
So, the front of the place is pretty well guarded, but that's it.
- And Felix?
- He hangs around the back. He's there.
- Fresh from the printer.
- Shall we?
I want to know who the hell they are!
They come out of nowhere, destroy my car, tell me to leave my home, and you say nobody...
Nobody knows anything?
No, Felix. Nobody's seen nothing.
Then maybe they're not looking hard enough.
"Blitzkrieg", or "lightning war", was a strategy pioneered by the Germans in World War II.
It refers to a fast attack designed to inspire fear and confusion, penetrating quickly behind enemy lines.
Good afternoon.
Let's get those hands up.
Thank you to back up against the wall. Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Nice.
Comfortable?
Hello, Felix.
Who the hell are you people?
The name's Johnny.
We got a lot in common, Felix.
We're both in the car-theft game.
Only we work Miami, and you...
Well, you work someplace else.
You've 48 hours.
After that, we'll make your travel arrangements for you.
Leave town?
I'm supposed to be scared of some fancy-ass suits and a shotgun?
You better get the hell out of my establishment.
I hear you. You're busy.
After all, you only have... 47 hours, 59 minutes...
And 10 seconds left.
Trust me, Felix.
You want to move on.
You got a lot of headaches here you don't need.
Miami is very humid in the summer, and you got all these people you have to manage.
Plus your place is on fire.
I'll kill you!
- Take care.
- You hear me?
Do you hear me?
Did you see the shopping list your mother gave Sam?
Corey is eating his own body weight in cereal every day.
He's a growing boy.
I have to say, I like this Johnny.
He's got flair.
He reminds me of your cover in Dublin when we first met.
Do you remember what you called yourself?
Michael McBride.
Michael McBride.
Sometimes I wonder if... He's the one I fell in love with.
I wouldn't be surprised.
We caused a lot of mayhem, you and I.
He was your type of guy.
Yes, he was.
Where did he go?
Oh, you know how it is with cover IDs.
You become who you need to be.
And everyone gets to guess who you really are.
I'll see you later, Michael.
I have an appointment at ASA Dismantling and Demolition.
Fi, if you see this guy...
I'll give him a kiss from you.
- Are you Eric?
- Yeah.
Nina Roberts, Green Row Publishing.
We spoke on the phone yesterday.
Oh, right.
- You sell the calendars.
- No, darling.
I make the calendars.
Theme calendars.
Firefighters, lumberjacks, cops, cowboys...
And now the men of demolition.
Nothing turns a woman on more than when something goes "boom".
All I need from you are names and photos of all your... demolition guys.
Do me a favor.
- Don't tell them you're doing it.
- Why is that?
No feelings get hurt if I just talk to the guys I'm interested in.
All I need is another homely firefighter offering to wax his chest in my office.
- What do you look for?
- Depends.
But I think I'm looking at Mr. January right here.
Target selection is one of the least glamorous but most important elements in any strategy.
You want to take out the people your opponent depends on.
The ones his organization can't function without.
Lose your keys?
I can give you a ride.
Don't look so scared.
Loaded it with a bean-bag round, so it won't do any permanent damage.
But the temporary damage, that hurts like hell.
Did I forget to mention that?
My fault.
My fault.
Maybe we should exchange insurance information.
Or maybe you should put these on...
And get into the trunk of my car.
You see? Look.
There's an element of theater in any offensive campaign.
It's not just about bullets and bodies.
Killing people usually creates more problems than it solves.
It's about undermining your enemy's will to fight, destroying the morale of his troops, sending the message that fighting back is useless because the battle is already lost.
I brought you a little going-away present.
- You call this a present?
- Yeah. They're alive.
Yeah, but you won't be.
I'm good to go if you are.
You really want to do this in front of all these people in broad daylight?
- You just wait, Johnny boy.
- Oh, I'll wait.
I'll wait 23 hours and 14 minutes.
Clean this up, man!
Hello, Johnny.
This is Tony Soto.
Maybe you've heard of me?
You're Felix's boss. Yeah.
There's a car coming up the street.
I see it.
I want to talk to you.
Well, go ahead and talk.
That's what phones are for.
No.
In person.
- Get in the car.
- "Get in the car".
I'm new to Miami, but are most people that stupid here?
I'll leave two of my guys with your people, unarmed, to guarantee your safety.
And I'm not asking.
I'm telling.
Now get in.
Keep these boys company.
I'm going to meet Tony Soto.
There's an old saying in war that no plan survives the battlefield.
Often, as a situation evolves, you create new enemies.
Sometimes you create new alliances, new friends.
Soldiers are fine for dealing with the enemies, but you need a spy to handle new friends.
Behold the ghost haunting Felix Cole.
- Where you from?
- Around.
Why am I here?
You got style, Johnny.
You're aggressive.
- I like that.
- Nice to be appreciated.
Felix has been a good earner, but any guy who lets someone punk him like you did, lets a 17-year-old kick his ass with a baseball bat...
Well, I can't have that kind of weakness in my house.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Which brings me to my question...
- What exactly do you want?
- My team doesn't like competition.
We want to be the only game in town.
- We're selfish that way.
- I'm selfish this way.
Nobody operates in this neighborhood without dealing with me.
I'll deal with you.
Listen, Felix is an amateur.
He steals a few cars for sale and lays the rest off in chop shops.
Go to a high school.
A kid can do that.
Us?
We deal in high-end export. Shipping them overseas at a markup.
Overseas?
How do you get the cars through customs?
We clean 'em and clone 'em.
Untraceable.
Sell them at twice the price.
Now, I can't have these idiots running around, boosting minivans with a shim and a screwdriver.
You can talk, Johnny.
I'm gonna give you that.
But let's see if you can deliver.
Hot off the street.
Bring it back clean.
Show me how it works.
You could be my new car man.
Felix is out?
Felix is out, or you are.
So, this is your job application?
More or less.
So, meanwhile, some poor guy's running around, looking for his $150,000 car.
We'll get it back to him.
We got to move fast on this one, Sam.
No kidding.
I went to Felix's place earlier to do some surveillance.
He's been going nuts since we did our thing.
Well, the more panicked he is, the easier our job is.
But this isn't just business.
I mean, he put the word out to every kid in the neighborhood to look for Corey.
That was the plan.
We made him look vulnerable.
With Tony breathing down his neck, he has to look strong now.
Quit yapping.
Let's go.
The actual theft of a car isn't difficult.
The hard part is selling it once you have it.
Between the license, registration, tax records, and vin number, it's surprisingly hard to turn a car into cash.
The best approach is to start with clean paperwork on another car from out of state, then match the stolen car to the clean paperwork.
That means new vin tags and a new registration.
And in case someone decides to check closely, some hydrochloric acid and a file will make the etched vin number on the car chassis impossible to read.
Well, that's it.
You think I should drive around South Beach, you know, just to make sure it still drives okay?
Knock yourself out.
- I've got a meeting.
- Okay. Say hi to Carla for me.
Hello, Michael.
Hello, Carla.
Do we have to go all the way to your office, or can we just do this here?
Everybody who's ever blown something up in Eastern Europe.
Your ex-girlfriend's on there.
- I think we can rule Fiona out.
- Really?
She has the expertise, and she certainly had access.
Lot of names here.
This could take some time.
Two days.
Driver.
I could get started that much faster if you just dropped me off at home.
- Go up, make a left, make a...
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Aw, man. Look at that sweater.
- What?
Yeah. That was Christmas.
Michael must have been 15, I think.
God, don't they look cute?
So sweet.
Must be nice.
Me and Corey, we never had a family like that.
Neither did we, sweetheart.
See the bruise on Michael's cheek?
He and his father got into a fight because Frank was... pushing his brother around.
Anyway, nobody was talking to anybody, so I said,
"I'm gonna throw the whole dinner down the garbage", unless they stood there and took that picture.
He fought his dad on... on Christmas?
He was being a good big brother.
Like you.
- Is that everyone?
- Yep. Past and present.
Look who's on top.
I'll schedule photo sessions in a few weeks, once I've had time to go over all this.
Cool.
Remember...
I'll be waiting.
- I believe I found your bomber.
- Who is he, Fi?
His name is Derek Poole, and he works part-time for ASA.
I guess we know what he does with the rest of his time.
- Can you get a home address?
- What do you think?
What's the word?
Fi got a name.
You expecting somebody, Mike?
Nope.
Who's there?
Sean!
What happened?
Felix and his boys jumped me.
They said if I didn't set up a meeting with Corey, they would go after my players.
He said he just wanted to talk to him.
No. He's going to kill him.
He'll probably kill you both.
Should we call the police?
Well, we could get Felix arrested for assaulting you, but his crew would be on the streets, and Corey would still be in danger.
So, what are we going to do, guys?
I can't have him going after my players.
Felix is on the edge.
It's time to push him over.
You're gonna call him.
Set up the meeting.
It's all right.
We've done this before.
This address Sean got from Felix?
It's an alley.
Industrial area by midtown.
- Perfect spot for an ambush? - Bingo.
You won yourself a beer, Mikey.
So, poked around.
Looks like this guy Felix is kind of a one-trick pony when it comes to hits.
A few years ago, one of his rivals got popped.
Same setup, different alley.
If something works...
Basically, car pulls in, bad guys box him in, hose him down with lead.
Well, this I can work with.
Can I work with that?
Thank you.
There are a couple of ways to make a vehicle bullet-resistant.
$60,000 worth of titanium siding will do the job.
Or you can pick up a few extra copies of the yellow pages from your local phone company.
Most non-armor-piercing bullets will only penetrate a phone book to a depth of an inch or two.
Behind a layer of steel, it's more like a quarter of an inch.
Commercially available foam sealants will keep your tires rolling long enough to get you out of danger.
For the windows, dual-layer, high-density plexiglas is your best bet.
It's expensive, but bulletproof glass is not the sort of thing you skimp on.
My guy called the cops.
It checks out clean.
You could drive to the police yourself, and you wouldn't have to worry about it.
- I must say, I'm impressed.
- We aim to please.
All right.
Let's check out this operation of yours.
Let's.
I figured you for a nicer ride.
We don't like to take anything flashy to our location.
- We can't afford to attract attention.
- You're careful.
That's good.
Maybe a little crazy, but you're careful.
And when it counts.
Now, about Felix...
Don't worry about him.
This checks out, I'll take care of Felix.
Countless wars have been fought over misunderstanding.
Tragic mistakes, misperceptions that turn people against each other forever.
That's Corey's car.
Let's do this.
Of course, it's not so tragic when you're the one creating the misunderstanding.
It's up here.
We operate out of a warehouse.
We do all our work there.
Nothing's in our name, so there's no connection to us.
Johnny, is that Felix's car?
- You tell Felix you were meeting us?
- No, I...
Why the hell is he here?
Did he follow you?
Get down!
Get us the hell out of here!
We got to ditch this thing.
- You can call your guys for a ride?
- Yeah, yeah.
Jesus. How did we...
We armored the car.
We're crazy, but we're not stupid.
- You know, that son of a bitch, he...
- Yeah, about that.
You have a few things to straighten out before we get into business together.
Yeah, I'd say so.
I think we're gonna leave Miami for a little while.
Let it cool down.
Give you time to clean house.
You straighten out this thing with Felix.
Oh, I'll straighten it out.
There's our ride.
We'll give you a call when it's time.
I want you to get big Ed on the phone.
I'm gonna take care of this cat.
Felix cleared out of Miami soon as he heard Tony was looking for him.
His whole crew left, too.
Yeah, it's probably safe to park in that part of town for a while.
Here's your tickets.
I got you three.
I heard there was a lady doing most of the work.
Piece of cake. Right, Mike?
Hey, Corey wanted to say thanks.
Hey, you guys.
Listen, man, I just wanted to thank you guys for saving my life.
Both of ours.
Thank you, and can you thank Fiona for us?
Look, if you get anywhere near the Super Bowl,
I want tickets, okay?
I want to be sitting on a goalpost.
You got it, man.
Yeah, Fi?
I believe I found your bomber's house.
All right, I'm on my way.
Bad news is, looks like no one's lived there in a while.
Mail's piled up in the box, newspapers stacking up.
I think I may go in and poke around a little while I'm waiting.
Fi, no.
I don't want to disturb...
You think I've never broken into a house before?
Fiona, just take it easy and be careful.
When you boobytrap someone else's place, you put the trigger in the door or just inside so the odds of tripping it are much higher.
If you rig your own place, the trigger has to be farther inside so you can safely enter.
A trip wire is a quick and dirty version, but a contact plate under the rug is completely undetectable.
Put a little accelerant on the walls... There's a reason they call it a firetrap.
It's Fi.
Leave a message.
Fi, I'm at the address you gave me.
Call me back if you get this.
- Hey, you can't be here.
- Anyone in there?
- It's too hot.
- Did you find anyone?
We don't know yet.
We haven't been able to confirm.
It's too hot.
- Was there a woman in there?
- Someone was seen going in.
I just need to know if someone was in there!
Did you see a woman come out?
Did anyone see anything?
Was anyone in there?
Move back! Move!
Move it back!
- It's Fi.
Leave a message.
- Fi, Fi, pick up the phone!
Call me if you get this!
I need to know where you are!
It's Fi.
Leave a message.
There you are.
You have got to get a landline in here.
Poole rigged his place to burst into flame.
It was no surprise, but I let my curiosity get away with me.
I waited for a burnout in one of the windows.
Now I need a new cellphone.
Michael, you didn't think that...?
Breakfast?
For me?
I see Fiona's spending the night now.
Good for you.
Putting down roots.
So, you've had your couple of days.
What's the good news?
I ruled out everyone on the list you gave me.
I took another look at the blast.
I'm checking demolition specialists, private contractors.
You could have someone look at that list, see if there's anyone worth flagging.
Is this some kind of a joke?
From what I hear, you have time to run around town playing dress-up with your friends, but the best you can do is a needle in a haystack?
If you have a better idea, I'm willing to hear it.
You're my idea, Michael.
Make no mistake.
There are those who think you're more trouble than you're worth.
I've convinced them that you're useful 'cause you can find the bomber.
What do you think's gonna happen if you don't deliver?
Same thing that would happen to you, I suppose.
You gonna run that check for me?
Give me the list.
It's time you focus on helping yourself, or you're not gonna be around to help anyone else.
It's Fi.
Leave a message.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, no job history.
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I.-
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
- Hey, is that your mom again?
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.
Getting information is all about fitting in.
If you're hunting for intel in the Middle East, that means a beard and a djellaba.
If you're doing it on South Beach, you're probably wearing... a swimsuit and flip-flops.
You think the sarong is too much?
Suddenly, I'm feeling overdressed.
You look fine, Fi.
Besides, we're here on business.
What is the big deal with this bomber?
If we looked for everyone who tried to kill you, we'd do nothing else.
I need to find out what this guy knows.
Well, if there's anyone in Miami who can track down a bomber, it's our old friend Seymour here.
Hope he's still not mad about the face full of gunpowder last time we dropped by.
Well, he was pretty enchanted with you once upon a time.
Pretty enchanted with me?
Yeah. He showed it when he attacked me with a baseball bat.
Will you do my shoulders?
You know, Fi, if, uh- if you wanna talk about what happened the other night-
There's nothing to talk about.
We were just blowing off some steam, right?
We should go in.
When it comes to intelligence gathering, you can't hold grudges.
The guy who hit you with a baseball bat yesterday... could be an information source today.
- Yeah, I'll take care of Mr. Security over there... while you say hello to Seymour.
- Hello, Seymour.
- Security!
Nice goin', Jackass!
You know, I learned a thing or two... after the last time you kicked his ass.
What's that?
You got hollow points in there.
Oh, you can tell just by looking-
No, I can't. But I can distract you long enough to take it.
Now, I just need help tracking someone down, Seymour. That's it.
You are such a badass.
It's kind of awesome.
You need my help?
Okay.
- One condition.
You gotta teach me some of these moves.
- Sure. All right.
What's everybody staring' at?
This is a party.
I'm sorry, Mike.
What are we doing again?
I need help tracking someone - an explosives expert, Derek Poole.
Oh, right.
A manhunt.
I love it.
Okay, first, you're gonna have to front me some cash to spread around.
It opens doors.
No? Okay.
I'll front you, because I know you're good for it.
But we are gonna have to be in constant dialogue, Mike, okay?
You and me, badasses in this together.
All right, Jackass, you see how they just laid you out again?
That is called teamwork, people.
And it is a beautiful thing.
So, up and at 'em.
Hit the blender, make some smoothies.
You like mango?
Mango.
Fi, I need a favor.
Uh, I need to put some money together.
Seymour said he'd front you.
Yeah.
Seymour's not the type of guy I wanna owe money to long-term.
You wanna borrow money?
If you need cash, you can get a job like the rest of us.
I can't fill out a W-2.
If the people who burned me... find out I'm looking for a job, they'll wonder why I need money.
I just passed on a gig for some art dealer.
Someone's stealing paper clips or something dull.
Pay's good.
You take a job under a cover I.D., no one needs to know.
You're the best. Mm-hmm.
I expect a commission, Michael.
Mike, do you have to work with Seymour?
I mean, the guy's unstable.
He's connected, and he doesn't mix well with government types.
Do you have my new cover I.D.?
Yes. You're Miles Parker.
Background in corporate espionage.
You're a desk jockey.
Perfect for a cushy office gig.
Looks good, Sam.
Yeah, Fi, looks like I'm good to go for that art dealer job.
Thanks.
I'll call you later.
Maybe we can grab dinner.
So you two are just grabbing dinner?
Just to debrief.
Right.
Debrief.
There are a lot of advantages... to taking on a new identity when you take a new job.
You can tailor your résumé to the position, and it gives you a lot of flexibility.
You just have to get used to the idea of lying to everyone you meet.
- I'm Miles Parker.
- Hi, Miles Parker.
- I'm here to see Scott Chandler.
- Mr. Parker.
You came highly recommended.
Scott Chandler.
Welcome to the gallery.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Can I get you something to drink?
Coffee?
Water?
Scotch and soda?
I'm fine.
Right this way.
Quite the résumé.
Wall Street, Silicon Valley, D.C.
Anyplace where a little information goes a long way, I've been there to protect it.
Any P.I. experience?
A P.I. license comes with a lot of privacy concerns.
There's a chance anything a private investigator finds could wind up in court.
Yeah, well, I prefer to resolve this quickly and quietly as possible.
Quick and quiet
- That's what I do.
Tell me about your problem.
A few weeks ago, I noticed unusual activity on the computers.
Files moved, log-ins at odd times.
And then, I started hearing a buzzing sound in my office phone.
I checked it out.
Infinity transmitter in its base.
Saw a lot of that in the dot-coms.
Whoever installed it didn't isolate the circuit.
You're hearing a little feedback.
I wanna know who planted this.
Any idea what they're looking for?
I sell about $30 million worth of art a year.
It could be thieves, buyers looking to lowball a bid, other art dealers.
Too many possibilities.
My business, my reputation... depends on information remaining private.
Let's take a look around.
Now, the gallery's under 24-hour video surveillance.
Can't get through here without someone seeing it.
What about the executive offices?
There's no cameras, but all the offices are keypad access only.
No one gets in here without me knowing.
Well, somebody has.
Does anybody have a habit of working late?
No later than I do.
I'm the first one in, last one out.
So what do you think, Mr. Parker?
Think you can find whoever's doing this?
I'll see what I can do.
I need a floor plan of the office.
I'll have something by the end of today.
Excuse me.
