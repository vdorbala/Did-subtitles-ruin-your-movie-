There's this psychiatrist a lady named Dr. Frances Cress Welsing. She has a theory about the black man in America.
She says that because of the system of racism he's been made to think of himself as a baby a not-yet fully formed being who hasn't realized his full potential.
To support her claim, she offers the following:
First off what does a black man call his woman?
Mama.
Second, what does a black man call his closest acquaintances?
His boys.
And finally, what does a black man call his place of residence?
The crib.
No!
I don't want to lose my baby!
Baby!
Come on, babe.
You all right?
We'll go straight home, okay?
Jody!
Baby, come on.
Just take it easy, okay?
Just get in.
Take it easy, baby.
Baby?
Yvette?
You going to sleep?
Are you hungry?
I'll go to Lucy's and get you a cheese enchilada and a strawberry shake.
That'd make you feel better.
I'm fine, Jody.
You don't need Daddy to be here for you?
I'm just trying to take care of you.
Seems like you already done that.
Leave me alone, Jody.
Just get out of my face.
Then I guess you don't mind if I use your car, huh?
Since you're going to sleep.
What's up, little homie?
What's going down with you?
Get the hell home.
Peanut?
Why are you screaming?
I'm hungry.
Fix me some food.
You gonna give me some love?
Hey, Ms. Herron.
How's Daddy's little girl doing?
Look at you. Suckie-suckie, now.
Come on.
How's Daddy's little baby?
-Jody, you're parked in the driveway.
-Sorry.
I'll move it.
Least you can do is wash mine before you leave.
I got it.
Say, "Daddy got it, Grandma.
Daddy got it all under control."
Look at my pretty baby.
One thing I know how to do is make some pretty babies.
That's my baby. That's my little girl.
When will you say "Daddy"?
You want to go to Disneyland?
That's my baby.
Sleep, sleep, sleep.
Go on and pull the damage out.
What you doing to the backyard, Mama?
I told you I was starting a garden.
You've said that for the longest.
I must be getting old.
I'm doing the same things I seen my mama do.
I'm planting collards, mustard greens and all this over here will be my corn.
Tomatoes.
Then I'll get a lace awning at Home Depot so I can sit here, tune you out and sip my wine while my tomatoes grow.
My cabbage is over there.
My beans, onions and sage.
How's Yvette?
She's all right.
Sleeping.
I can't give you money every time you get a girl pregnant.
I know, Mama.
This is Melvin.
He's helping me with my new garden.
He owns a landscaping business.
Maybe you can work for him and make some money.
Your mama told me you got a problem finding a job.
I know how that is.
I had that problem too, before I got my own business.
I'll take these back to the truck.
I'm gonna see you later?
I hope so.
So you got a new boyfriend now?
Mama gotta have a life too.
I'm trying to get money.
That's all I'm about. I desire sleep.
-Hey, homie. Want some weed?
-No, man. I'm cool.
I ain't gonna make no money here.
There's too many weed mans.
Let's go holler at these hos.
How's moms doing?
She cool.
I think she got a new boyfriend.
Some old thug-ass nigga.
I know she'll want to kick me out.
He'll want to lay up in the house, move me out so he can get at Mama.
Next thing you know, he'll be goin' upside her head.
Ain't that the way it go?
Why are you still with him? You're always at the clinic.
It ain't Jody's fault.
It take two.
I stopped taking my pills.
There you go blaming yourself again.
How many times do you call on the phone about his ass?
Cut him loose.
I don't care if you got a baby. He don't own you.
Look, Jody don't put his hands on me, no matter how mad he get.
He ain't crazy.
Bitch, how long you been with Chris?
Three years?
How many times has that nigga gone upside your head?
How's your eye feel?
It's all right. It's all right.
Shit. At least we living together.
He just want to play with your life and string you along.
He with his other baby's mama when he ain't with you.
Please believe. He don't love that ho.
Oh, but he love you, though.
You need to check him.
What's he say about moving in?
Jody wants to live with his mama, not with me.
Jody, my Jody.
He's a mama's boy.
He'll never leave his mama.
Then let him fuck his mama.
Have her ass up at the clinic. Shit!
I love you, Jody.
I love you too.
I want you to have my baby.
I want to have your baby.
I want to have your baby.
I love you, Jody.
I love you.
I love you too.
I love you, Jody, but you scare me.
You scare me.
No, that's my baby.
Oh, my baby.
Don't cry, Mama.
Give him back!
God, please, give him back!
Jody!
Can I have my car so I can get to work?
Your car?
My car!
Go on with all that, girl.
I'm here asleep.
It's Monday.
I can't be late.
Monday?
What's that supposed to mean?
Get up!
Please be on time.
I'm always on time, Yvette.
Don't have me waiting.
Give me some sugar.
-Love you.
-I love you too.
You gonna have a good day?
Be good.
Listen to Daddy.
I love you.
Love you too, Mommy.
Thumbs up. My man.
You be good too.
-I'm always good, baby.
-Yeah, right.
Come in front, little man.
Young baller, future shot caller.
5:05, Jody.
Don't be late.
You want to nod your head too?
That's my boy.
Wait a minute, Jody! Hold it! Shit!
You got a man out here waiting.
How do I look?
Okay.
Where you going?
I don't know.
I'm just going. He asked and I'm going.
Necklace or no necklace?
You don't know.
Why don't you know where he's taking you?
How'd you know to wear that tight-ass dress?
This is an all-purpose dress. I am prepared for anything in this dress.
He likes music, so we're probably gonna hear music.
You know where he live?
Been to his house yet?
What you know besides him smiling at you?
He could be crazy.
Is he a killer like Henry?
Why don't you get an L-7 boyfriend?
A white-collar brother with a briefcase.
You like them thugs.
I don't know why.
Your daddy was a thug.
I need a man who can handle a woman like me.
He's got to be a thug to handle you?
Melvin's not a thug.
He's a nice guy.
I'm going out, that's all I know.
That's all I need to know.
I got a date.
I look "okay"?
I look good.
What's up, man?
Them's some nice shoes.
Stacey Adams.
Stacey Adams, huh?
OG style.
So where y'all going?
I'm taking her to a club on Crenshaw, listen to some music.
My partner's in a band there.
That's good. That's real good.
My mama likes to dance.
I asked 'cause I just met you and I didn't want to chaperon you old folks.
That's my brother, Ray.
He lived here until Mama kicked him out over her last boyfriend.
He dead now.
My brother, I mean.
So where you live, man?
I live in Inglewood.
I grew up on 101st and Vermont.
The Hoovers.
That was a long time ago.
I was young and dumb.
Jody, are you messin' with my date?
No, I'm keeping him company.
Playing the host.
Nobody likes sitting up here, waiting alone.
Why can't women be ready on time? They always make us wait.
Whatever, Jody.
All right, y'all have a good time.
Mama, remember your curfew.
You need money?
I got some change for you.
Jody, you ain't got no money.
Bring me back a Fatburger, on the real, little cheese.
Go in the house!
You be careful with my mama, man.
Got that pure cake.
No butter, no sugar.
Straight, like my brother's soul.
We got pound cake.
-Give me some pound cake.
-Here you go, brother.
Thank you, brother.
Have a good day.
Today I begin a new life.
I am the master of my abilities and today will be a great and beautiful day.
What?
I said, today I begin a new life.
I am the master of my abilities and today will be a great and beautiful day.
Pillows, pillows. Goose down, $35.
Pea, are you a buyer or a seller?
What?
Videos, homie. Videos.
DVD, CDs, Master P, Charlie's Angels.
Look at yourself.
How many millionaires you got on?
I count at least three.
What are you talking about?
Pea!
Look around, man.
You see what I see?
I see money.
Look at my man there selling T-shirts.
A brother selling pies and papers. Cake Man over there.
Everybody moving, making money, right?
While we standing still, being broke.
I figured all this shit out, man.
All this.
The world moves forward through transactions.
Commerce, nigga.
The exchange of goods and services.
All the real ballin', successful folks are sellers.
All the broke people playing catch-up are buyers.
I ain't trying to go out like that.
I'm gonna be a seller.
I'm gonna get my own business.
Change the game.
You want to sell clothes?
Like the man who came to the phone company selling dresses.
Remember?
Cute ass.
-Women's or men's clothes?
-Women's.
Women buy clothes every other day.
But you need to know about women.
I know all about females.
You hear your son?
-You're a bad boy.
-Believe me.
Are you trying to be a salesman or a shyster?
You buy from a shyster, you feel like you got took.
You buy from a good salesman and you feel lucky.
A good salesman makes you feel so good you'll go back again to give more and more money.
That sounds like sex.
-What else should I know?
-Sizes.
You gotta know a woman's size on sight.
Don't wait for her to tell you.
Just know.
-Compliment them, even if they ugly.
-Especially if they are.
-Like Bernice.
-She's big.
They'll be your regulars.
You need to know her favorite color, what's in season....
And fabrics.
How it feels on our skin.
What's an average size?
I'm a size 5-6. That's average.
For who?
A white girl?
Jody, I'm a size 1 6 and that's average too.
-Remember that, you'll make money.
-It's best on payday.
Rachel?
My name is Joseph Summers. My friends call me Jody.
You want to be my friend?
I wonder if I could talk to your customers show them my merchandise.
I didn't want to come in and talk to people without your blessing.
What you selling?
You see this?
That's your color.
You're an earth-tone woman.
It match your hair.
Feel how soft that is right there. See that?
See? See how soft that is?
This is from Paris, France.
You'll change the game with this. It's couture.
Girl, that's polyester blend.
You pop it in the dryer and go.
This dress is perfect for you.
It's an all-purpose style. All-purpose dress.
You know what that means?
You can wear it to work, go straight to happy hour.
Them pants got happy hour written all over them.
Baby, I ain't gonna lie to you.
Them is one of a kind. Explosive!
You see anyone with them pants on, you can come bite me.
It ain't happening.
How much?
I'll let it go for $40.
Forty dollars? !
Look, $35.
That's the lowest I can go. You're killing me.
Okay, 35.
Thank you.
I'll squeeze my tiny ass in this and upstage these bitches in here.
You like it? Cute.
One two hundred, three....
That's four hundred dollars!
That is crazy!
Lord, that's crazy. That is crazy. Okay.
Come on, dog.
I like!
It look good. Your mama look fly, don't she?
Your mama look good?
-I got another surprise.
-What?
That beautiful dress, my son looking nice....
We're doing big things!
What'd you do to my car?
I got them tinted windows done.
I got some 1 0s from my Mexican homies.
I told you she'd like that.
Daddy got taste.
Want some breakfast?
--I learned so many incredible secrets.
When placing ads in newspapers just one secret I can show you can make you a fortune.
Nice, huh? State of the art.
Yeah.
This is the bomb.
-Mama didn't say she got a new TV.
-She didn't know.
It's a surprise.
Oh, yeah?
I have to hook up the VCR and set the timer so she can see--
I hooked it up and set it already.
Pass the remote, youngster.
Let me show you how it works.
I got this bad boy from my man for free.
You know how much it costs in one of them electronic stores?
-It cost a grip.
-You got that right.
But we black folks live by the barter system.
You know about that?
When black folks had no money, we traded for things.
My man give me this TV 'cause I did some work for him back in the day.
You know, shot a couple niggas, cut up some folk.
I was like you, Jody.
Young, dumb and out of control.
I did a dime.
Ten years straight in San Quentin and Folsom.
All over some dumb shit.
But you? You're smarter than I was at your age.
I gotta hand it to you.
You're smart.
You're no killer like me. That's good.
I was bad.
I ain't had my dome straight.
But, Jody, peep this.
On the real.
Me and your mama are getting real serious so I'm gonna be around here for a while.
I ain't trying to be your daddy or nothing, but if you need advice feel free to talk to me.
'Cause I seen it all and I done it all to the full.
You may think you see new shit out here, but it's just a rerun to me.
You know what I'm saying?
Mama?
Mama, have you got this nigga living up in here now?
-Can't I have a life?
-You got a life!
Them days are over.
I ain't like Big Mama. I got to have fun.
You have fun.
Why can't I?
But why does the man have to live here?
He a killer, and you got him in the kitchen scrambling eggs and drinking the Kool-Aid?
He was making me breakfast!
All right.
What am I supposed to do?
Roll over and die?
You gonna kick me out?
You gonna kick me out?
Let me know now.
I don't need no surprises.
I do.
Surprise me and move out.
You could learn from Melvin.
He's done well for himself.
He's turned his life around.
He has his own business. I don't have to force him to get a job!
You're not a baby no more, Jody.
You need to grow up.
You got your own family.
Why don't you and Yvette get a place together?
Why are you so afraid to grow up and be a man?
Leave the nest.
I am a man.
So you're kicking me out?
What for?
To be with this nigga?
You don't even know him.
What do you mean, "leave the nest"?
You didn't! This is Grandma's house!
I don't have to leave if you never did!
What are you talking about?
Mama needs a life too.
Fuck you, bro.
Can you tell your son something?
No, I'm not in it.
But why he do the things he do, Miss Juanita?
You must know.
I don't know what to do.
I love him, but how much can I take?
I can't believe this!
I told you, I won't be in y'all's business.
What's between you and Jody is you and Jody.
What do I do with his selfish ass?
He got me and his son walking while he rolling in my car.
The car I'm paying the note on.
Man, I feel so stupid.
You ain't stupid, Yvette.
You're just in love with a man.
When you in love with a man, he can make you feel high.
So high you just be in outer space.
But he can also make you feel low.
Real low. And he can keep you there. Keep you down.
If you let him.
But don't even worry about feeling used.
It's just temporary.
We all get used. Men use women, women use men.
Just accept that you'll be used.
But if you feel so used that you got nothing left if the man ain't giving you the energy you need to love him even when he's acting like a bastard, you need to let go.
If you ain't got nothing to give yourself or your baby you won't have it to give to him.
Good boy.
Now the corn.
Did you finish the tomatoes?
There you go.
Thattaboy. A little more water on the greens.
Hi, Juanita.
Where's my baby?
Hey, Mama.
Bring my grandbaby here so I can kiss her goodbye.
Bye, sweetness.
Be a good girl.
Ooh, Melvin!
Oh, baby.
-You gonna give me a cavity.
-Oh, yes, baby.
Melvin!
Okay, circles. Around and around.
Take it, take it.
I love to ride!
It's the African squat fuck. The old nigger squat fuck.
Squat, baby. Squat, baby.
Can y'all keep it down?
People are trying to sleep!
Let me down, baby.
Fuck!
--and that she was impressed. Broke her off.
Made her feel good.
Now I got myself a regular customer.
What the hell is he looking at?
Trying to psych me out, talking about being a killer. Old-school nigga.
He don't want us to have to put heat on his ass, do he?
Want me to take him out?
Let the nigga breathe.
He make my mama unhappy, we make his ass bleed. On the real.
Make him feel the steel.
Long as she happy, he got his life. Won't be no strife.
And I hope his ass hear me too.
I hear you.
You know your problem?
You think you know everything, but you don't know shit.
I see you got a little business going.
Well, that's good.
You make that paper.
But when you making paper, there's rules that go with it.
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter.
There are two types of niggas. Those with guns, and those with butter.
What are the guns?
That's the real estate.
The stocks and bonds.
Art work.
Shit that appreciates in value.
What's the butter?
Cars, clothes, all the other bullshit that don't mean shit later.
That's what it's all about.
Guns and butter.
You little dumb motherfuckers.
See what I'm sayin', cuz?
This nigga doing this shit every night.
What?
Why can't you just sit still and relax?
Don't complain. You left me here all weekend!
Don't complain. You left me here all weekend!
Why can't you sit still?
That's what divides us as a people. No focus.
Why don't you sit down and focus?
Watch some PBS or something.
You so full of shit. So fucking selfish.
What's this old pizza?
Since you're starting shit, where you been since yesterday?
Slinging dresses, making money.
Got the brakes fixed.
What you been doing?
-You been fucking around?
-Nope.
Let me smell your dick.
Go on with that.
If you ain't been whoring around, let me smell your dick. I can tell.
Go on.
I ain't playing with you. Move!
I'll knock your ass out.
See?
My shit smells good, don't it?
See what? You probably washed it off.
I'm tired of you messing around on me.
I know you and Sweetpea was out doing me wrong.
I didn't do nothing.
You gonna sit there with a straight face and say that?
I didn't do nothing.
I was over at Kim's, playing spades.
You're a liar!
You went to that after-hours spot.
Some nasty heifer was shaking her ass in your face then you went to a private room with the bitch and did I don't know what!
I know 'cause Chris was there. Sharika's Chris?
He saw you.
You busted.
It's all on your grill, stupid.
All right.
I was there. But I didn't fuck.
She just danced for me, that's all.
-Did you touch her?
-Hell, no. That nasty girl?
We can't touch them anyway.
It's against the rules.
Private dance, that's all.
Just a quick lap dance.
You don't believe me?
It's the truth.
I didn't fuck!
It was a private dance, in the corner. I didn't do shit.
You must take me for some kind of fool.
You foul. I smell your dirty ass from here.
Why you got to be around them nasty girls?
They do that shit every night, dummy.
You know how many dicks they suck every night?
And you go down there like the rest of them fools!
You better not bring me nothing from them bitches.
Fuck it then! Don't believe me.
I said I didn't fuck that girl.
Stop putting your hands on me.
Where you going?
I hate you!
You're selfish, arrogant and stupid!
-Whatever.
-I don't need you!
I'm tired of sitting here, not having a man with me.
Being lonely. I'm gonna do what the fuck I wanna do.
What are you gonna do?
I said I'm tired of waiting for your ass.
I hate you.
I'm gonna have me a man.
A man who wants to be with me and my baby and have a family.
A real man, Jody.
Not some little boy, still living at home with his mama.
Fuck you! Kiss my ass!
Go out on the streets and be a trick. I should knock you the fuck out.
You better not, or I'll call your probation officer and they'll put you back in jail! Now....
Kiss my ass, nigga!
You better walk away.
I hate you! You so stupid!
You hate me?
Keep on saying that shit.
That's right.
I hate your ass.
You make me sick.
I can't stand your black ass!
You act like a little boy instead of a grown man.
I hate you!
You know what?
I hate your ass too.
Do something.
Give me my keys.
You ain't going--
Get off me!
There you go, coming downstairs showing off before the neighbors.
-Fuck them! I hate you!
-I hate you too!
I love you! I love you so much!
I love you too.
I ain't going nowhere.
-You feel him?
-Yes, I feel him.
You feel him?
Oh, my God, I feel him!
He big!
-What do you feel?
-Daddy Dick.
-You love Daddy Dick?
-I love him.
-You say it.
-I love Daddy Dick.
You gonna clean all that mess up?
-I'll clean up!
-You gonna cook some tacos?
My God!
I'm about to come. I'm gonna come!
Yes, I'll make the tacos!
Oh, my God....
I could bite you right now.
Damn, boy. Shit!
Now what?
That's the beat-it-up-white dance.
You are so stupid.
I was over there to the right. Did you feel me?
-I see you ain't going nowhere.
-That's 'cause I'm sprung.
So you're gonna clean up that mess and make tacos, right?
I'm gonna cook and clean.
You put it down.
I'll feed you, you big old monster.
I love you, boy.
I love you too.
-Bring that chocolate here.
-I'm on my way.
Come here. Just make sure you can handle me.
You trying to go for round two?
Jody, when I say I hate you, what I really mean is that I love you.
But you scare me.
It's like we ain't gonna be together.
I'm trying to sleep.
We'll always be together.
Unless I get killed or something.
Don't talk like that.
Don't even play around like that.
I'd go crazy if something happened.
On the real, you know why I made you have Joe-Joe?
I thought I was gonna get shot out in these streets. I wanted a piece of me to still be here, even if I was gone.
When he was born, I was like, "Cool.
No matter what happens to me I'll still be here in some way."
So if something happened to you, what about me?
You'd be all right.
Go to sleep.
You don't want me here? Kick me out!
Shut up, Pea!
Nobody said that!
Y'all in there- - What? Sinuating?
-You need to shut up.
-No, you do.
You're the one talking loud and making noise.
Are you back-talking me? Huh?
You don't know how to act towards your man?
I'll put my foot so far up your-- Come on in, Jody.
A houseful of women! Houseful of sensitive females dealing with they damn hormones! Y'all unstable creatures!
I won't say the "B" word. "Unstable creatures." That's my new word.
Mama, don't say nothing.
You'll make it worse.
He's leaving anyway.
I'm trying to concentrate.
They won't let me be.
Want a drink?
-No, I'm cool.
-Why are you acting all shy?
My house is your house Mi casa es su casa!
I got milk, water, Kool-Aid strawberry soda.
I'll get you a strawberry soda.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Daniels.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
And Kim.
In fact, I love you more, 'cause without you Kim wouldn't be here.
Y'all said you love me!
You told me I could stay here!
Bought me new clothes and the video game!
I thought we had a family!
I got no family!
I'm trying to make that happen with y'all.
-What, nigga?
-Come here.
I'm talking to my family here.
I love y'all.
Both of you.
Come on.
I need you to roll with me.
All right, then. I'm leaving.
Let's go get some liquor. Strippers ain't at work yet.
You don't need liquor.
You're already too fired up.
Who the fuck are you calling fired up?
You're responsible for the shit they give me.
You still ain't found me no job! Hook me up with your business!
When you gonna find me a job?
-Why I gotta find you a job?
-'Cause you my man!
Okay.
Step to my office.
All right.
You have a mission.
I'm gonna give you one piece of merchandise.
If you can sell it, we can talk business.
-Sell one thing.
-One thing.
Check it out.
I got dresses, shoes, baby clothes.
Take your pick.
I'll sell this dress.
-Not that.
-I know what I want to sell!
Yes, the original cake. The original man.
Salaam. Break bread, brother.
Hey, take a look at this dress.
Want to buy it?
-Not my color. -No, no, hold on.
Stand still.
Look at that.
That looks good.
I don't want it.
It don't even look in season.
It is.
They're wearing this in Paris.
I saw Tyra Banks in this and you finer than her.
What's the material?
Goddamn!
You want to buy the dress or not?
You treat me like I'm some fucker asking for change.
I'm doing something constructive.
I could be out knocking folks over, but I'm trying to live right.
You call that living right?
Selling a stolen dress?
I ain't stole nothing in my life!
I got this from my homeboy.
That's what y'all do?
Boost?
Sell stolen stuff?
Like that man there trying to sell that camera?
-You don't want me answering it?
-Go ahead. It's probably for me.
Collect call from California Correctional Facility.
Correctional Facility?
Do you accept the charges?
Hell, no!
Who's calling you from jail?
That nigga Rodney?
Oh, you don't hear me now? Hello!
Rodney's lonely.
He just want someone to talk to. Don't trip.
That why the phone bill was an extra $1 00?
I'm paying you to talk to him?
You putting my money on his books too?
Didn't I tell you to put a block on the phone?
You don't listen to nobody.
Don't even trip.
Collect call from California Correctional Facility.
I accept.
-Hello, Yvette?
-This ain't no motherfucking Yvette.
Put her on the phone!
This is my house!
Don't ask to speak to my woman!
Your house, nigga?
You don't even live there.
Is this Jody?
The Jody that got my boo pregnant?
Who won't take his responsibilities as a man?
Living at your mama's house?
Running around like a little boy?
You's a bitch!
Look at you! What you got?
Your ass in jail!
Don't tell me how to handle mine.
Don't call my fucking house no more!
My girl ain't feeling you, cuz!
Nigga, concentrate on not dropping the soap bitch-ass nigga!
Fuck you, cuz.
I want a block on the fucking phone!
All right, Jody! Damn!
What are you doing, sitting on the phone, telling him my business?
He's saying:
"You still live with your mama!" I don't want to hear that!
She's so suspicious.
She always think I'm fucking someone.
I go to the bathroom, "You got a bitch in there?"
I'm going to the store, "There a bitch at the store?"
Then I got to come home to Melvin and his bullshit.
I want to get saved.
Say what, bruh?
Get the fuck out of here!
We're talking.
Poncho!
I'll be done with your bike in an hour.
I want to be saved, Jody.
I need to be baptized, so I can go to heaven.
Wash my sins away, so them gates open up.
I don't want Jesus to say, "Turn your ass around."
You should do it too. Get baptized with me.
What did you do, man?
You did something bad to be saying this.
No, I'm trying to keep from doing something.
I need money.
A job to keep me busy.
Something besides playing Madden all day.
I don't even stay at Kim's house during the day.
I leave at 9:00. Come back at 6, acting like I did something constructive. Like I'm working.
I ain't did that shit since continuation school.
Sneaking around Kim and her mama like I'm a child. Like I'm a scared little boy.
I gotta ask my woman and her mama for money.
How do you think that makes me feel? Like a man?
This shit is tearing me up, cuz.
It's eating me alive.
I don't want to end up killing nobody.
What am I gonna do, Jody?
Shit, I was in the same boat too.
You gotta find something you like to do. Something you're interested in.
Like I did.
What you good at?
Robbing.
-Hey, Jody.
-What's going on?
-What's up, Jody?
-What's going on with you?
-I need some new boots.
-I got you covered with gator, girl!
They might be bootleg, but I got you, girl!
Dresses! I got some business suits coming in!
You'll love those!
Why are you yakking and talking shit?
I'm trying to make money.
When money come in, you never complain.
Don't be cute.
Nice and quiet.
My own little spot.
Watch my tomatoes. Got some wine.
Over there.
I think I see some weeds by the peppers.
Why don't you use Weed-B-Gon?
I'm a natural gardener. That's how it was done way back. You get on your knees and pull them up.
It's what my mom and daddy did. It's what I do.
Remember to put the weeds in the compost pile.
You doing nothing but bossing me around.
I think I'll plant some summer squash next year.
-Jody, we got to stop this.
Every time I come out, you go in the house.
Nobody's thinking about you, bruh.
This is where I relax.
Take that noise somewhere else.
Every time I come out to work in the garden, he goes in the house.
Give me some wine.
Seven, winner.
Baby, be sweet.
Eleven, winner. Seven, eleven.
That's all I'm rolling.
How come you ain't brought your kids around?
Don't you got a son, 1 7, named Duquan?
And a little girl about 5 named Maya?
-You tell my mama about them?
-She know.
Why ain't you brought them around?
You ashamed of them?
They ugly like you?
I don't get along too well with my babies' mamas.
-I'm sure you understand.
-No, I don't.
I'm cool with both my babies' mamas.
-We'll see how long that lasts.
-Long as I want it to.
But we're talking about you, not me.
I talked to your son the other day.
I heard you say his name when y'all old niggas was here playing cards.
He live five minutes from here, in Inglewood.
I drove to Morningside High School and asked him about you.
He didn't have shit to say about you 'cause you whipped his mama's ass.
What do you think about that?
You gonna beat my mama?
No.
I think you know better than that, don't you?
You want to walk around here with your chest out, saying you a real man.
Know why I don't like you around my mama?
'Cause you foul.
You're a dirty motherfucker, Melvin.
Don't think I'll let you get it in her head to kick me out like the last nigga did my brother.
'Cause I ain't having it, bruh.
No way, no how.
Ah, youngster.
You get your ass out of here.
Mama!
Yeah, that's right.
Call for your mama.
I stayed off you out of respect for her.
If not for your mama, I'd have broke your little ass down long ago.
"Jody?
Little Jody?"
Know what I see when I look in your eyes?
A scared little bitch.
That's what I see.
If we was on lock-down, I'd make you get on your knees.
Twenty years. Let's see where you be 20 years from now.
Melvin?
What y'all doing?
Nothing.
Can you go get me some cigarettes?
-Maybe some beer.
What you doing?
-You're so sweet.
Watch your hands.
Hurry back, okay?
Want anything from the store?
What's up, Jody?
The candles smell good.
Aromatherapy.
You smoke?
No.
I don't mess with that.
So you and Yvette got a baby?
Where y'all stay at?
We don't live together.
You ain't gotta lie.
I know y'all live together.
You drop her off and pick her up every day.
That's just what we do.
I don't want to discuss 'Vette.
We don't need to talk.
I just want some dick.
Why you want to fuck me?
To make my girl mad?
-That what you want to do?
It ain't like that.
I just think you're cute.
I mean, I see you all the time.
When we was in the parking lot I thought we was feeling each other.
Was I wrong?
Yeah, I was feeling you. But I ain't feeling this.
I'm out.
Jody, come on.
Don't be like that.
This is just between us.
I see how you look when you come around.
You saying you don't want to hit this?
Come over here and get this pussy.
I don't need to go there with you.
Yvette.
Besides, I ain't got no condoms.
No way.
Somebody don't want to leave.
Oh, fuck!
What are you doing, girl?
I can't do this.
Oh, shit.
I know you want this.
I can't do this.
I promise it'll be good.
No, this shit is foul. It's foul.
This shit's wrong!
Get off me.
I can't fuck you.
My girl finds out she'll kill me.
I love her too much.
So you a little bitch?
Your girl tells you what to do?
I told you it was a trick.
Hood rat.
I don't need you! I can get dick any time I want!
You want this!
No, you want this.
You lucky I let you taste it.
This Daddy Dick belongs to Yvette.
Not from what I hear, you ho!
Fuck you!
You don't know how to suck dick anyway.
Why is that bitch staring?
I don't know, but she about to get slapped.
Fuck you.
No.
How come you ain't waving at her today?
I ain't thinking about her.
She was staring at me today.
She was about to catch a beat-down.
I think she's a lesbian for real.
She want your sweet stuff. Do some carpet munching.
Shit! She better get back.
-All around the world.
-Stop!
Nasty!
-You cooking tonight?
-No.
-Lazy ass.
Whatever.
Let's go to Lucy's then.
-Cheese enchiladas.
-Strawberry shake.
I got it.
No, I got it.
-No, I got it. -I got it.
All right, then.
Have it.
Let me get two steak tacos a chicken burrito and two strawberry shakes.
That'll be $11.89.
I'm starving. Hungry as hell.
What's this?
Condoms.
How'd you get that?
Don't flip this.
What's it doing in my car?
-Hello!
-Can I get the food?
I can't believe I fell for that shit you said the other night. How you're gonna do right by me and Joe-Joe. How you won't cheat not gonna hurt me, keep breaking my heart.
What was all that?
Writing on the money.
-Give me that!
This is bullshit.
Get the food!
Thank you so much.
"Thank you so much." You being funny?
"Trojan.
Very Sensitive.
Lubricated.
America's No.1 Condom." At least you went all out.
All I get is a trip to the clinic.
Give me my shake!
So who was you fucking?
Don't lie.
You been fucking somebody in my car, Jody?
No.
I don't know.
You don't know?
You mean you don't remember who you were with?
You been with that many girls?
I'm tired of you fucking around.
Damn, I want to see other niggas!
That's right.
They be asking me out too.
But, no. I'm here, sticking to your ass!
-All right. Go out, then.
Whatever.
Who did you fuck with these condoms?
I'm not stupid.
This is a three-pack and there's one left.
Tell me the truth!
We're grown. We ain't kids. Be real.
Be a man for once in your life.
You still fucking Peanut?
I know you're still fucking Peanut.
I figured that much.
I ain't even mad at you, 'cause I already knew that.
Did you fuck her with these condoms in my car?
No, you didn't fuck her in my car.
Did you?
No.
Are we picking up Joe-Joe?
He's fine.
Take me home. We gonna finish this.
Jody, I know you love me.
I also know you fuck other girls.
I don't like it, but I know you.
So just be real with me.
Will you be honest?
If you can take it.
You're starting to get on my nerves.
I'm getting on your nerves? You're the one fucking around.
You get with any of them clients of yours?
A few.
Feel better now? I love you, girl.
You got my son and you'll probably be my wife.
-You want me to be honest? -Yeah, I do.
You're my woman. Them other hos is tricks.
I want to be with you, but I fuck other girls occasionally.
I don't know why, I just do.
That's it.
You feel better now?
There's honesty for you.
Deal with it.
I love you enough to be honest.
If you loved me, you wouldn't lie to me all the time.
Move!
Hold on.
You got it all twisted up!
I lie 'cause I love you.
Being honest means I don't give a fuck.
Out on the street, I tell the hos the truth.
I lie to you because I care.
It's obvious you can't handle the truth.
You fuck Pandora?
Why-
- Come on, Yvette.
Open the door.
If this food gets cold, I'm gonna be mad.
Since you're being honest, just be real.
Did you?
If you want me to, yes, I did.
What do you mean, if I want you to?
No, I don't want you to!
Oh, my God.
You did.
Why, Jody? -I didn't.
I was playing with you.
-Not with that bitch!
-I fucked others. Not her.
With someone at my job?
-No. I wouldn't do that to you.
That's breaking the code.
I wouldn't do that.
-Staring at me and shit-- Why you so fired up?
You gave those bitches at my job a reason to laugh at me!
Calm down before I come slap you.
You ain't doing shit!
Why you insecure?
Nobody's laughing at you.
They're probably jealous you got a man who loves you.
Don't be so insecure.
I can't stand it.
If I'm insecure, it's because you made me this way!
All you think about is yourself!
Out of all people, why'd you have to fuck that girl?
Damn!
-I told you I didn't!
-You're a liar!
-I'm out of here.
-You ain't leaving.
-Get out of the way. -Stay here!
I'm sick of your shit!
Don't put your hands on me!
Are you fucking crazy?
Shut up!
Are you crazy?
I'm sick of your cheating on me, Jody!
You make me sick!
You're full of shit!
I told you to stop hitting me!
Oh, shit, Yvette.
Come on. Get up, baby.
Get the fuck off of me, Jody!
Baby, I'm sorry.
You hit me!
Yvette, come on. Get up. Get up, baby.
-Get your hands off me!
-Stop it.
I love you, girl.
Get off me, Jody!
You lied, Jody.
You said you'd never hit me.
I'm sorry.
You lied....
I hate you, Jody.
Why are you doing this?
Baby, why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I promised.
It was my fault.
I'll make it up to you.
I'll make you feel good.
Jody!
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.
Who are you?
I'm Popeye the sailor man!
-Who are you?
-Who am I?
-Who am I? -That's what I said.
Popeye, you ain't gonna do nothing.
Son of a bitch!
Someone stole my damn car!
Son of a bitch.
Mama!
Yvette.
Hi, baby.
Baby, don't be mad at me.
It ain't my fault.
I love you.
I'm listening.
Some Mexican stole your car.
What? Jody--
You hear?
I hear you.
You got that tracking thing on?
Cool.
We'll find it in 30 minutes.
Call the po-pos.
-I ain't doing that.
Why?
I know who stole my car.
Who?
Tell me and I'll get it back for you.
I stole my car, Jody.
Jody, where you rolling?
Y'all watch my bike, homies.
Open the door, Yvette!
Go away!
I'm sorry I hit you, okay?
You blacked my eye too.
What about me? Why are you mad?
When will you grow up?
What? I am grown!
No, for real, Jody.
When will you realize you had something really good?
I take a lot of shit from you because I love you.
Baby, I understand.
I understand, okay?
Please open the door. Let's discuss this inside.
I won't be selfish no more.
I won't fuck other girls.
I'll be good, I promise.
You hear me?
You don't mean it.
You're just running your mouth, like you always do.
You don't mean that shit!
Open this motherfucking door!
Why'd you steal my car?
-Your car? !
Yeah! If not, give me back the Daytons I put on.
The tinted windows I paid for.
The money I put into the engine and the brakes!
-Open this door! -Jody, don't do this!
Daddy!
No, Joe-Joe.
Come here.
-I want to see my daddy!
-I want to see my son!
I'm gonna call the police!
My son wants to see me!
Why are you keeping me from my son?
-Stop kicking the damn door!
-Jody, please go away.
-Your neighbor's snooping!
-Go, before I get put out!
-Fuck you, Yvette. -Me?
After all the shit I put up with?
Fuck me? ! Fuck you!
All right.
You remember this shit, girl.
That's fucked up. I can't believe this shit.
You okay?
Hey, Jody. Come here.
Come dance with me.
What's that thing y'all do?
The C-walk?
I got it.
Look.
That's it. Look, Jody.
Come on, Jody!
She don't understand how much I love her ass, Mama.
I mean, I cheat. I do what I do, but I'm good.
I'm good to her ass.
I take her back and forth to work, I fix the car when it breaks I give her money for the phone bill and groceries.
I even rub her feet sometime!
She say I'm selfish.
Ever see it from her point of view?
What if you was Yvette and she was you?
What if she fucked around on you took your car and left you at home all day with a baby?
-You're taking her side.
-Hold it.
All I'm saying is you may be a little selfish.
Jody.
Look at me.
You have got to think of her as a woman.
What if someone did all the shit you do to Yvette to me?
Your daddy used to do the same shit you're doing now.
I just know how Yvette feels.
Yvette loves you. She just feels hurt.
A woman gets tired of a man after a while if she feels used and unappreciated.
Believe me, as much as you're thinking about Yvette she's thinking about you too.
Stop telling girls you want a baby while you're doing it.
They believe your lying ass.
I fell for the same shit when I was their age.
Yvette.
You know you love this shit.
No, you love this shit.
You bet I do.
I love that big ass, girl.
Yeah. For sure.
Please believe that.
Hey, girl.
What you doing?
Are you on the damn phone again?
Get off the phone.
What's that noise? You okay?
That's Chris.
Nigga is trippin'.
We've been drinking thug passion.
Get off the phone! Bumping your gums, talking to hos.
You made up with that nigga Jody yet?
I ain't thinking about him.
Yeah, right.
Jody know that's his pussy.
-I won't put up with it no more.
-Am I invisible?
I feel you.
-Hello!
Lights on.
Anyone home? -I definitely feel you.
Hang up and come here so I can drop it in your drawers.
Damn!
These niggas trip when they think they own you.
You need to check him.
You need to check these nuts.
Shut the fuck up!
You see I'm on the damn phone!
-Shut your motherfucking ass!
Always talking to them bitches about they niggas.
Attend to your nigga.
Jody crossed my last nerve.
I can't put up with it no more.
-You know what I'm saying?
-I know.
Who the fuck are you talking to?
Who is that?
I thought about getting back together but I gots to teach him a lesson, know what I mean?
Girl, I ain't gonna lie.
I miss his ass like shit.
I love him to death but I can't have nobody act like they own me, even my baby's daddy.
You feel me, girl?
I feel you. I feel you.
I gotta go.
Jody.
I knew that nigga would get his shit together.
Oh, shit.
What's happening, baby?
I'm home.
What you got to eat in this motherfucker?
I'm hungry as fuck.
You know how I get down.
One Alizé a day. $15.15 exactly.
A cup?
You think I'm gonna drink in front of the store?
Throw your ass off my motherfucking bike, nigga!
What up, cuz? This all the Alizé you got?
We got Alizé.
You niggas don't want to see me.
I'm Looney Toon.
-You know who you fucking with?
-So? Do something!
Nobody want your punk-ass bike, cuz.
Pea! Pea!
Pea, get out here!
What happened?
-Shit! Nigga, what happened?
-I got jumped.
-By who?
-Some little niggas.
By little niggas?
! Get my gun!
Is that the niggas there?
Yeah, that's them. That's them, Pea.
I got something for their ass.
Pull up over here.
She just started Dorsey.
-She 14?
-That bitch look like she 21.
The one with the hat's the one who took my Alizé.
Y'all talking about these hos. Let's go get some.
Hold up, nigga.
Nigga, watch that shit, man.
It's your size.
What the fuck are you doing, nigga?
Shit, nigga! Your ass stinks!
Leave us alone.
Get on the ground, motherfuckers!
No, Pea!
Get on the ground.
How you doing, homie?
You ain't so hard now, huh?
What up, nigga? What you got in your pockets?
Say something.
You stinky-ass nigga.
Take a bath, homie.
These broke-ass niggas ain't got no money.
Fuck that shit.
Stand up.
Teach you to respect elders before you die.
Looney Toon, huh? Bark.
Punk-ass nigga.
You tried to take my liquor!
And you tried to take my bike.
What kind of bitch-ass punch was that?
I thought I taught you better.
I hit the nigga in the teeth.
Are you saying his teeth are harder than your fist?
Let me show you. You gotta learn the one-hitter quitter.
No, Pea.
Not him.
Hit Mr. Alizé there. He took my liquor.
Do him first.
You got to get up close.
You kind of draw back.
Not too far, though. Aim for the nose or mouth.
-Prefally the nose.
It's soft.
-"Prefally," huh?
Nigga, you know what I mean.
It's over then.
You try again, nigga.
-Get your ass up, bike man.
-Come on, cuz. My jaw hurt.
Nobody got sympathy for you or your homies.
Trying to jump somebody.
Get your bitch ass up right now before I bust your head open!
Don't flinch, nigga.
Stand still.
I said, don't flinch.
That's it, baby boy.
Don't flinch.
Don't move or I'll hit you with two.
Chuck that shit up. Chuck it up, little nigga.
Oh, shit. This nigga got heart.
Look at this nigga.
You got heart?
You got heart, cuz?
Go ahead and tell us.
Don't fuck with him.
He got heart.
Let him go.
Yeah, I won't hit him.
I won't sock you, 'cause you got heart.
I respect that.
You ain't no punk-ass mark like the rest of your homeboys.
-I won't hit him. I'll whip your ass.
I'm gonna whip your ass!
Who's your daddy?
-You're my daddy.
Louder, nigga!
I'm gonna beat your motherfucking ass!
Fuck you, jumping punk!
Get up!
I'm not done with you.
You need a whuppin', motherfucker.
Respect your motherfucking elders, punk!
This stupid motherfucker's crazy!
Be off this bitch, cuz.
What part of "couch" don't you understand?
I'm fresh out.
Ain't you happy to see me?
No.
I didn't tell you to come here.
You invited yourself.
When my parole officer saw your letters, he approved my stay here.
I wrote you twice, just to be nice.
I wasn't thinking about you.
You wasn't? Why'd you accept all them calls then?
I must've been in your head.
I'm your first.
Your first, your last and you're my only.
-Quit playing and give me some love.
-Get the fuck out of my room.
I ain't going there.
And don't wake my baby.
You can have a baby with Jody, but you won't fuck me?
You better get to the couch before I call your parole officer.
-Oh, like that?
-Yeah, like that.
Give me an extra blanket.
Get it out of the closet. And close my door.
Who are you, loc?
Where's Yvette?
Jody?
Nigga, are you Jody?
Yvette ain't here.
You come to get your little son?
Come get his ass.
I ain't trying to be his father.
Joe-Joe, come here.
You okay?
Go downstairs.
Hurry up.
I can't believe he had the audacity to come to my house after he talk shit to me when I was locked up fucked my bitch and had a baby by her! Go get the heat.
Fuck this!
-Hey, nigga.
-He's riding a bike?
You sound real hard on the phone.
-Y'all got to get that nigga, cuz.
-That nigga's a moron. -I'll get that fool.
-Full speed ahead.
Come on, little man.
You're getting heavy.
You hungry?
You know about that music, youngster?
That's grown folks' music.
Oh, that's Marvin!
What's he say, baby?
Jody.
Marvin?
Please believe me.
-Them niggas still at your house?
-No.
Wait right here.
I didn't ask Rodney to come.
He just showed up.
Now he won't leave.
You wanted a man at the house.
I guess you happy now.
I didn't ask him to come, Jody.
I'm not fucking him, if you're thinking that.
The car broke and the engine needs fixing.
Ain't my problem.
-Get the fuck off my doorstep.
Wait!
He don't love me no more.
He don't love me no more.
Oh, my God.
He don't love me no more.
Get me out of here!
-Peanut, what you doing?
-Nothing.
You miss me?
You love me?
You hear me? You love me?
What do you want? I'm busy.
You ain't doing shit.
Get me so I can give you a sample.
What? I ain't coming to get your ass!
Where's your other baby mama's ride?
Why you doing all that?
Tell you what.
When I want some dick, I'll call you and you can find a way to get here.
Is this what I think it is?
Jody!
Jody! What is this?
Cannabis.
It was in my tomato plants!
I show you something new, and you do this? Plant this shit in my garden?
-Are you saying I planted this?
Who else?
I didn't.
You need to check your boyfriend, Melvin.
You're blaming me for his bullshit.
You know you did it!
Melvin wouldn't do no shit like this.
You trust him before me?
Why would I put weed in my mama's garden?
-Shut up!
What kind of fool do you think I am?
Where's Melvin?
Ask him!
-He's a bitch-ass nigga.
-Shut up, Jody.
Watch. I'll show you.
Tell him.
Tell him, Mama.
Tell me what?
She found the weed you planted.
Tell her about it so she can get off my case.
You did it, huh?
Melvin....
-Yeah.
-Kick him out, Mama.
-Mel!
What were you thinking about?
-Getting blazed.
I'm not understanding.
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
Ain't that a bitch.
Oh, so it's cool now? When it was on me, it was World War III. But since Mr. Melvin 'fessed up to it, it's all good?
See how you is, Mama?
I would never do that shit.
I don't want to go back to jail, or put you there. But I don't get no credit for that.
-Shut up.
-Can't stand the truth?
Shut up!
How you think I feel, you laid up with this thug-ass nigga you don't even know, who wants to kick me out.
I can take care of myself!
You don't need to check the folks I deal with.
Am I in your business with all the hookers you run with?
No.
So I need the same respect!
You are getting on my last nerve with this shit about Melvin!
This is my house too!
Your house?
Your house?
Do you pay any bills in this motherfucker?
Do you fix anything?
When's the last time you paid a bill?
All you do is eat, sleep and shit!
Walking around here like you're King Tut!
Don't give me mess about whose house this is.
It's mine!
If I want to bring a man in I'll bring a man in!
That's my say, not yours!
What the fuck you laughing at?
-Your spoiled ass.
Melvin, honey.
Don't start anything, please.
No, 'Nita.
He need to hear this.
I keep quiet out of love and respect for your mama... -...but you need to be a man.
-Be a man?
What do you mean? Like you?
I should be like you, Melvin?
You could never be like me.
You don't need to be.
What you need to do is to stop blaming everyone for your problems. Check yourself.
You know what your problem is, baby boy?
You got shit twisted.
You got an Oedipus complex.
Your mama ain't your woman.
But this is my woman.
My woman.
All right, that's enough.
Come on.
Forget this shit.
I got heat for niggas like you.
-Jody, that's enough.
-Nigga, you need to move!
What, motherfucker?
I said not to fuck with me!
Stop it! Melvin, stop! Melvin!
No, Melvin, stop it! Stop it! Break it up!
Are you crazy? !
I told him not to fuck with me!
But you want to fuck with me?
I try to be a good nigga, but I can't because bitch-ass niggas like you want to fuck with me!
You want a nigga with two strikes to go to jail for life!
I'm leaving.
No! I'm leaving.
I can't live like this.
-That's right!
You leave this house!
-You deal with your son!
-Or I'll kill him!
-Don't go.
-Deal with him before I kill him!
-"Don't go"? !
You're choosing this nigga over me? !
Your flesh and blood?
Your child?
You are not a baby anymore!
You are not a child!
Wants to fuck with me, I'll kill him!
Wait! Calm down!
If I get killed it's on you, Mama.
You got your own life.
Yeah.
Mama got a life too.
I know now.
Don't call me when he starts beating you.
I'm sorry.
I fucked up.
Nigga, who told you to light my candles?
I'm trying to set a mode.
Ain't no "mode," and get your feet off my table.
Ow, nigga!
You will never taste this again, ever!
-Hush with that.
You know you love me.
-That's why you out there.
Quit bullshitting yourself.
You quit.
Better use your hand! Towel's in the closet.
Do what you know, jailbird. Good night.
Hold me.
Hold me tight.
Rodney, wake up!
Goddamn!
Rodney, you have to find somewhere to live.
You can't stay here no more.
You know I ain't got nowhere else to stay.
I don't care where you go, just go!
Get your monkey ass out!
My house smell like stale feet!
Get out!
Good morning, scrub.
Built you a little fort, huh?
-I don't give a fuck about your fort.
-I hate you.
I hate you too, li'l nigga.
You ain't my son.
Shit.
-Come here, Yvette.
-Get off me.
We need some order around here.
-Get your hands off me!
First, we need to get married.
-Then you'll have my baby.
-I ain't having no baby by you!
Why not?
You got a baby by that punk-ass nigga Jody!
-Two days and you ain't gave me any.
-That ain't my problem!
-Get off of me!
-You know you love me.
Get out of my room!
Get your ass back over here!
I'm sick of playing games.
Sit your ass down.
I'll break your fucking face if you get up again.
You're gonna give me some.
Turn over.
I'm horny.
Don't hit my mommy!
Shut up!
Go watch cartoons.
-Joe-Joe, go to your room, baby.
-Open up.
-You're gonna have my baby.
-Leave my mommy alone!
Stop it!
You're gonna rape me?
In front of my son?
Stop!
Stop it! Get off my mommy!
Get off me.
-I want my daddy.
-I know.
-Fuck your punk-ass daddy!
-I do too.
Fish and bread keep a poor man fed.
Add 'em up, bro.
I'll get you something to fight with.
It didn't take you that long to sit down.
He see you.
He's just trying to front.
Thanks, Kim.
What's up, Pea?
Strike 'em up.
Where you at, Pea?
Come on, add them up.
Where you going, Yvette?
Why you acting all man?
It's like you don't miss me.
You don't know what I've been through the last two days.
Rodney tried to rape me in front of Joe-Joe.
He was screaming, "Daddy!" and I was there alone.
Baby, I'm here.
I miss you. I miss your ass so much.
I love you.
You're my rib.
You heard of Adam's rib?
That's how God made Eve.
I'm gonna get my stuff.
Damn.
I can't do this.
How you gonna get him out?
I don't know.
But if we whip his ass, he'll come back with his homies and shoot me, my girl and my baby.
I ain't trying to be no killer.
I can't have that on my heart, Pea.
I feel you.
If you don't want to, I'm with you.
But if you do want to take this fool out, I'm here too.
Let's pray on it.
Dear Lord, please forgive us for the sins we have brought upon us and show us forgiveness for all our sins in the future.
I know you understand that niggas ain't perfect, but we try, Lord. We try to keep our heads up in bad times.
This is a bad time.
Show us the way.
And if you can't show us the way, then forgive us for being lost.
Jody.
Motherfucking Jody.
I'm sick of this bitch-ass motherfucker.
Cuz, you ready to smash on this nigga?
I know where his homie stay.
Turn on Vernon.
This nigga's dead.
You're a lover, not a fighter.
Y'all thirsty?
I'm straight.
Holler if you need anything.
Cool?
Everything's copacetic.
I hope Yvette hurry up and gets back over here.
There's my girl.
Yvette?
You see this shit, Pea?
Played too much.
Yvette!
Get your ass over here.
What happened to Jody?
-Go back inside!
Thank God.
I thought I was.... I thought I was dead.
Fuck!
I thought I was dead.
Yvette?
Where you at?
What's up with the lights? Yvette?
So you're just gonna turn off the electricity?
What? I'm supposed to be scared or something?
Shit!
Come on!
Look! Get him!
Blast!
Come on.
Fuck! Goddamn!
Finish him off, man.
Do it, cuz.
Shoot me, motherfucker!
I done seen everything except Christ anyway, motherfuckers!
Shoot me, nigga!
Come on! Come on!
Fucking coward. I'm a fucking....
Get the fuck back, nigga.
What's cracking, Mama?
-You hungry?
-No.
Where you been staying?
-I found a place.
Everything's grown now, huh?
I'm about to pick some greens for tomorrow.
Throw them in the sink, wash them.
What do you want, Jody?
Money? I got no money--
No, Mama.
God!
I'm cool. Gee whiz.
You want some money?
Yeah, I want some money!
20 years' worth.
If you was one of them mutual funds, I'd be paid.
Melvin told me y'all had a talk.
Yeah, we did.
I'm glad you got a boyfriend.
I'm glad you're happy.
I just thought once you got a new boyfriend, you'd kick me out. I'd be out in the street and get killed like Ray-Ray.
You did kick me out but I ain't dead yet. I'm a rider for mine.
Nobody kicked you out, Jody.
You just left the nest.
And quit this talk about dying.
Nobody's gonna die no time soon.
You don't know what life'll deal you.
Just try to be happy while you're here hope there's another place better than this and hope that Jesus lets your ass in.
But while you're here you better watch your back.
That's what I know, Mama.
That's what I know.
Let me get some of this wine.
That's mine.
Go get your own.
Why? You realize I'm a grown-ass man right about now, right?
-It's cool.
-So stupid.
I'll get my own.
I love you.
I love you.
You be good.
Ain't no thing, Mama.
I'm gonna do my thug thizzle.
I'm gonna make some changes, change my life.
What's cracking?
What's up, Jody?
Not much.
Loving this California life. You know.
Keep my mama happy, bro.
I'm on the job.
Stay up, baby boy.
I got you.
What you know about that?
That's my shit, youngster.
"You know nothing about it.
It's for grown folks."
I used to get a lot of pussy off that song.
Pick up a bigger jumpsuit.
Why you always leave me walking?
Walking will help you drop it off.
Real funny.
I can't wait to drop it off.
I love y'all.
I'm about to spank that ass.
No, I'm about to spank that ass for life.
Please believe me.
On the real!
-Is that what you think?
-That's what I know.
I bid four books.
-Gotta get four. Stop talking shit.
What?
That's cool. Take your little shit.
Bring it back.
Girl, you don't know nothing about this.
I got things going on you wouldn't understand.
-All that talking.
-That's all to Jesus.
Nigga, put the card down! Put the card down!
I'm gonna take it.
-I love you.
-I love you, but I'm gonna take that.
Can I get some love?
Don't say you love me and don't give me no love.
I get a little pickle tongue?
Okay, back to the ass whuppin'. Here we go.
Talk to me, baby.
Should I bid for nine?
Bam, nigga! What nine?
You better get your three bucks.
Be gentle with my baby, okay?
-I know.
I should. -You'll create a gangsta.
It's a girl.
This one is mine. I need a girl.
It was doing the Crip walk last night.
It's a boy.
No, it's a girl. Please give me a girl!
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again?
An instant of pain, perhaps.
Something dead which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE
We'll be there soon.
What the...?
It fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.
They came they defused it and they left it there. Nobody can move it.
Follow me, please.
Carlos...
Wait for me here.
We won't be long.
Who are those people outside?
The caretaker and two men who help him.
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.
They're building a ohicken coop.
What's going on out there?
- They've arrived.
- Ayala and Dominguez again?
Yes.
Ayala's wounded.
They're always in trouble.
They've brought another boy.
As if we didn't have enough already.
Let's go.
Are you a new kid?
Got any candy?
Or a bit of bread?
I'm Galvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he looks a lot.
I'm Carlos.
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?
No, but I've got some comics and toys.
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.
I can't do it.
I can't accept another boy.
I can barely feed the ones who are here.
I'm sorry.
He's the son of a comrade killed at the front.
The boy doesn't know.
He doesn't know.
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.
Oh, no!
I'm the brave one.
Ricardo was a man of books of ideas.
He decided to die and leave me here to defend his ideals.
The Nationalists will arrive any day and what will they find?
Reds looking after the children of Reds.
Not to mention this!
If you want to leave the boy, take the rest of the gold.
There are 10 ingots left.
At least you can buy guns.
I can't even buy bread with it.
Take it away.
We can't.
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- You decide.
The boy goes hungry here or gets killed out there.
Class time!
Come on!
Look, Owl, a comic book!
I'll swap you.
Look at this marble.
It's my favorite.
It's from China.
Or look at this one.
Owl made it himself.
All made from snot and mud.
It's six months of snot.
Hey, you!
That's mine!
- Are you here to stay?
- No.
Then why are you here?
I came with Mr Ayala, my tutor.
What's a tutor?
He looks after me while my father's away.
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.
Take the comic from me.
Go on.
Take it away.
C'mon.
Carlos, look!
Mr. Ayala.
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!
Stay with him for a while.
He seems well behaved.
I'm sure you'll get along.
We'll have to fix it.
"The Count of Monte-Cristo. "
Has Edmond Dantes broken out of prison yet?
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.
- Do they manage to escape?
- I don't know.
Why don't you read on and tell me?
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.
She teaches maths and reading.
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?
Her name is Carmen.
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She's the principal.
Why did they leave me here?
Why can't I be with my father?
Carlitos you're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.
So be patient.
Your soap has to last you all year.
Be careful with it or you'll be punished with two weeks of extra tasks.
You can play in the yard, but never inside the building.
This is your bed.
Number 12.
Why are there so many empty beds?
Some boys run away, but I wouldn't advise it.
It's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...
For your locker.
Do you understand?
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.
See where they put the new kid?
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!
Pig and I think that even though you complain a lot you're all right here.
Far away from the war, well hidden.
Well looked after.
- What could be better?
- Granada.
Why go to Granada?
We're getting married.
We want to buy a farm there.
Sure.
Granada!
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?
I don't need anyone.
I've managed fine on my own up to now.
Right.
And without parents.
Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.
- Yeah, the school's gold.
- That's why they eat so well here.
You don't believe me now but you will.
I'll try these two tonight and let you know what happens.
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?
- No.
- All right, so long.
I don't like those two.
...I'd stand here in the middle of the yard and I'd look up at the sky.
I dreamed of getting out of here.
I prayed to become rich so I could buy this dump and tear it down.
You're so complicated.
I don't want anyone to know I spent 15 years here.
Well, I'm glad you came back.
Let's go to my room, it's getting oold.
San... ti...
Who are you?
What are you doing?
- Me?
Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?
The fucking new kid spilled our water.
Come on.
You'll have to get more from the kitchen.
Isn't that off limits?
No one's ever been caught.
What about the "one who sighs"?
What's it to be?
Are you going or not?
Who's the "one who sighs"?
You're chickenshit.
No, I'm not.
You're a shit, a queer.
All right, I'll go.
But you're coming with me.
We'll each fill a jug.
But if you're scared...
They say it's switched off.
But I don't believe it.
Put your ear against it, you'll hear ticking.
That's its heart.
It's still alive.
And it knows we're here.
Hide!
That one.
C'mon.
See you outside.
"No one's ever been caught. " Bastard. Shit!
Hello.
Who are you?
Do you live down here?
Many of you will die.
Jaime!
What are you up to?
"Out, out, yearnings of mine.
It flatters pity...
It flatters pity not to be able to hide.
Let your lips bear witness...
... to the blaze in your heart.
No one will believe the fire if the smoke sends no signals.
He who cares for his wellbeing keeps not his feelings silent.
My grief is greater than I
And that being so it will be easier it will be easier for it to defeat me than for I to command it.
Consideration does not suffice to prevent the cry.
He is not a brave prisoner.
Who dares not break down his gaol. "
A grain of strength.
Carlos, are you going to tell me who was with you last night?
He's not going to tell.
He'll squeal in the end, just wait and see.
You understand?
Then, for the last time... Who was with you last night?
I was alone.
That boy won't talk.
If we want to know who was with him...
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.
Perfect.
Very well.
You may begin.
They think Carlos has told, but they don't care.
They're ravenous, look at how they're eating.
The first one to look up from his plate is his accomplice.
Marcos,......
Galvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here.
I knew you wouldn't squeal.
Dr. Casares tricked me.
That's what I said.
It isn't your fault, we were punished.
Dr. Casares is real smart.
He sure is!
Careful.
Come on, Owl.
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!
Well, well!
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.
Are things that bad?
If the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...
Try it now.
I told you.
Dance with me.
- No.
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on, dance with me.
I can't dance.
Ayala said so.
Catalonia is about to fall.
Then Madrid will fall, and then...
- There,s talk of a ghost.
Have you heard?
- Yes.
Sometimes I think that we are the ghosts.
Galvez... Last night, you didn't shoot.
That's right.
Wow, that's great!
It's for you.
Why are they laughing?
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.
England or France might still intervene.
That's just wishful thinking.
- You're like Ricardo.
- No.
No, I'm not like him.
20 years ago, I found the place for me.
And I stayed.
That's all.
Look at it jump!
Where's the new kid?
Are you the "one who sighs"?
Do you live down there?
Listen...
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr. Casares.
Ass-kisser!
Throw him down!
Go on!
He can't swim!
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!
There he is!
Grab him!
Careful!
What's going on?
What have I told you?
And you, eh?
What the fuck are you doing down here?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
If anything happens to you, I get the blame.
Get out!
Out!
Say a word about this and I'll cut you in half.
Got that?
There you go.
Our Carlos has been here five minutes and he's in trouble already.
Have you read any more of "Monte-Cristo"?
Do you believe in ghosts?
There aren't any in the novel.
I think I saw one, here.
Carlos, as you can see, I'm a man of science.
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.
Europe is sick with fear now, and fear sickens the soul.
And that, in turn, makes us see things.
in town they call this "the devil's backbone"
They say a lot of things.
That this happens to children who shouldn't have been born.
"Nobody's children. " But that's a lie.
Poverty and disease.
That's all there is.
The liquid they're in is called "limbo water"
In the old days, it was made with various spices cloves, rum...
So this is very, very old rum.
I sell it in town and the money keeps the school going.
Do they drink it?
They say it helps to cure blindness, kidney ailments and also, apparently, impotence.
Rubbish, but you know...
After 60, men will pay anything just to...
You know.
So if you're going to believe in ghosts and all that rubbish you should have a sip of this to heal your wound.
No, I'm not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?
Yes, of course.
And be more careful?
Calm down.
I'm not going to hit you.
So don't make any noise.
Carlos get out your comics so we can look at them.
- That ring is pretty.
- It's from a oigar.
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.
Look.
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, like a photo.
She's a looker!
Who drew this?
Her pussy's the wrong way round.
It looks like a mouth.
What would you lot know?
Look, a slice of fig cake.
It's a bit squashed but it tastes good.
No, give me back my comics.
I want it back.
All right.
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.
You're a real artist.
When I grow up, I want to draw comics.
Like mine?
No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.
And big ships with lots of cannons.
These bugs are disgusting.
What do they eat?
Did you hear that?
A sigh.
I didn't hear it.
I heard it too.
Don't kiss me.
Right, I forgot.
This is the last time.
"This is the last time. "
Same old story.
Don't make any noise.
Scared the old man will hear?
I've never been scared.
I'm ashamed.
Yeah.
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.
He's a gentleman.
What a pity that isn't enough.
You need a hard cook as well.
And your husband and the doctor...
Tough luck.
The old man looks at you with love.
He did that even when your husband was alive.
I was 17.
By then, they took care of the poetry and I of the flesh.
This leg...
I don't like to think about this leg.
It hurts.
Some days I can't bear it.
But I need it to stay on my feet.
I saw those lights again today, in the sky.
That's the war, it'll never end.
The war's shit.
Well, like it.
You like it, dickhead?
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.
My mother says that the earth's so dry here.
and the air's so hot that the dead get stuck half way to heaven.
- That's rubbish!
- It's like the "one who sighs".
Not that again, you little shit!
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared.
Santi.
Since then, no one has dared take Jaime on.
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.
Shit, I'm telling the story.
The teachers think that when the bomb fell Santi got scared and ran away and maybe some shepherds found him and he's alive.
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.
Yeah.
They sell the blood to rich people to cure their tuberculosis.
And where's the ghost?
It came with the bomb.
Maybe if you ask it...
Take that one.
Out of the way.
Put those in, but be careful!
Don't break them.
Miss...
Look, I found this.
I thought you'd like it.
Open the gate, Jaime.
It's lovely.
It looks like gold, but it isn't.
Well, for me, it is.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
What's that?
Kids' stuff.
Can anyone tell me what these elegant gentlemen are hunting?
- Galvez?
- A pig.
Well, a boar.
Why not a giraffe?
Carlos?
A mammoth.
- Very good.
And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.
Very good.
Your tutor taught you that.
In those days, men had to act in groups.
No one could give up.
Imagine the death of a mammoth.
It must have been terrible.
A mammoth steak, great!
When you get to draw your comics I could help you write the stories.
I don't need anyone.
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?
Tomorrow, we'll continue with the second part of prehistory.
Leave your things in the dormitory.
Then it's recess.
Santi...
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.
Here you go.
There isn't muoh.
Hey, you!
Bastards!
What's going on?
International Brigade. 2 Spaniards, 6 Canadians, 1 Chinaman.
What the fuck's a Chinaman doing in a Spanish war?
You, look at your damn feet!
Someone you know, doctor?
Bomb...
If you're alive tell me where Santi is.
Santi...
Talk to me.
I don't want anyone to die.
Many of you will die.
Please.
A grain of strength.
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.
I need to talk to you, but I don't want the boys to hear.
Things are very bad out there.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.
We have to leave.
Today if possible.
- Ayala was taken prisoner...
- Ayala?
Yes, I'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.
Go where?
To Marseille, with the Ricards.
- We can't stay here another minute.
- But I can't leave the boys!
Very well, we'll take them, as many as we can.
- We'll use the gold. - The gold belongs to the cause.
fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!
I always thought there'd be an afterwards.
There is no afterwards!
Carmen if anything happened you...
Doctor...
The boys are waiting for your permission to have breakfast.
I'll need some papers.
But we'll go.
Boys, you may start.
Come along.
Get started, please.
Get started.
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.
She's coming for me soon.
Last night I saw the "one who sighs"
Last night?
You're making it up.
It's Santi.
I'm sure.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
What about me?
Fuck me, right?
Well, good.
I want you to finish breakfast, but while you're doing so listen very carefully because I have to tell you something...
You can go, but the gold stays here.
The gold?
Is that all you care about?
That's it.
What are you doing?
I hid you here so you wouldn't die outside...
- ... with no one to mourn you.
- Give me the key.
You know what?
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.
The lost one.
A prince without a kingdom.
Shut up!
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said, shut up!
Get out of here, or I'll kill you!
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.
Will this weapon work?
You know that while you say sweet things to this old hag I'm the one who screws her?
And now get out.
What did you see?
You know already.
I don't know anything.
Tell me.
Santi.
He's the "one who sighs".
He's dead, isn't he?
Come on, boys.
Conchita...
Would you bring me a few cans of gas for the journey?
Please, no!
You'll all travel in the back of the truck.
It'll be a long journey.
The older boys will have to look after the little ones.
If any of you are scared you can sit with me.
What are you doing?
Are you all right, ma'am?
It's my bad leg.
It's heavier than ever.
Did you think someone would just give us a farm?
What are you doing with that?
You're crazy.
They're all inside.
You going to shoot me?
Please...
- What was that? - The children!
Get them out!
It's going to blow up!
Outside!
Carmen?
Alma, leave it be, come on!
Get out!
All of you!
- I'm very cold.
- It's all right.
Don't move.
Don't move, don't look.
Is it bad?
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!
They won't have heard the explosion in town.
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.
If I walk all night, I'll get to town by noon tomorrow.
I've...
I've got something to tell you.
- If I don't tell you now...
- No, please, don't.
I couldn't...
I can't hear you.
So, please...
This time let me do the talking.
- I've learned a new poem.
A poem.
"Stay by my side as my light grows dim, as my blood slows down and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain as my heart grows weak and the wheels of my being turn slowly.
Stay by my side as my fragile body is racked by pain which verges on truth and manic time continues scattering dust and furious life bursts out in flames.
Stay by my side as I fade so you can point to the end of my struggle and the twilight of eternal days at the low, dark edge of life. "
Miss...
A grain of strength.
Carlos, look.
Dr Casares...
That son of a bitch...
I should have killed him when I had the chance.
But he'll be back.
And I'll be here waiting for him.
Carlitos bring me my records, my music.
I need them.
All right?
Are you hungry?
"Eat beans, good for the heart.
The more you eat, the more you fart. "
My stomach's all upset.
But the little ones might be hungry.
Could you kill someone?
I could.
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.
But I didn't kill him.
- I thought...
- I was with him.
I saw everything.
It started in the pit.
I dared him to come down with me at night to gather slugs.
Run, Jaime.
Jacinto's here.
- What did you see?
- Nothing.
- Did you see the safe? - No.
Did you see the safe?
Why the fuck are you in here?
Who was with you?
Get up.
Get up.
I was a coward.
I was always afraid of Jacinto.
Very afraid.
But not anymore.
The next time I see him I know I'm going to kill him.
Look who's here.
What'll he do?
Say you're sorry and get in the car.
I'm not scared of you.
You're making me look like a fool.
Say you're sorry, they're looking at us.
I'm not afraid of you.
Say you're sorry.
You're an animal.
Doctor, I did what you told me.
I did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.
Conchita...
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming, dootor!
Help me on my feet.
Jaime, put on the record.
Turn the horn towards the window.
Didn't you say he was dead?
Bastard!
Nobody knows anything.
We're going to wait.
They're leaving!
All my life I've always stopped short left things unfinished.
I'm not going to leave you alone, I promise you.
I will never leave this place.
We'll wait for you upstairs.
I'm not going to run away.
I want to talk to you.
Nothing.
They must have driven on.
Tell me, what do you want?
Jacinto.
Bring him to me.
I understand.
I'm going to help you.
Jaime!
I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!
I had to break the old man's fingers.
Even dead, he's stubborn.
Hurry up!
Come on!
There's something here!
Marcelo!
Out of the way!
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.
This is yours, isn't it?
We have to get out of here.
One of us has to climb through the window.
And then open the door.
And what then?
What's wrong?
You scared?
Yea, I am, asshole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.
You're not bleeding, you're not even hurt.
Santi is dead.
Jacinto killed him.
If we stay here, he'll kill us all.
Do you want to sit and wait?
You think that he'll let us go?
That it'll all work out if we behave?
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.
Yes, but there's more of us.
Wait!
Wait.
Check if they're still working.
Go on.
All right.
Galvez, did you hurt yourself?
A bit.
fuck!
Look again!
There,s nothing here but souvenirs, photographs!
Just crap!
One of us has to go out and get Galvez.
Who'll do it?
I'll go.
No, not you.
I'll go, I'm skinnier.
Who opened it?
Dr. Casares opened the door.
He said I'd be all right, and that we should be brave.
There's no fucking gold here!
You hear me?
You and your fancy ideas!
fuck!
Gold, gold...
My ass!
My father.
He was from Canada.
He was an accountant.
My mother was from Toledo.
And that's me.
It's blurred, 'cause I moved.
But that's me.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Pig, do you think your brother in Portugal could put us up?
We don't have much time.
"How lonely, the prince without a kingdom the man without warmth.
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga. "
I saw that gold.
It's here.
We just have to look for it.
We'll find it, and tomorrow we'll burn everything.
And the boys?
They've got no parents.
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?
We're at war.
A drop in the ocean.
Look, Jacinto.
Burn the place, kill the kids, I don't give a shit.
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.
- We need stuff from the car. - Hurry up.
I'll need a hand.
Come on, Pig.
You're crazy, asshole!
fuck you!
No, fuck you!
It's all for me.
Son of a bitch!
What a joke!
Calvez, you go over there.
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle.
Santi...
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again?
A moment of pain, perhaps.
Something dead whioh still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
A ghost.
That's what I am.
TO MY PARENTS
- No.
Hmm ... come ...
Coffee?
As a rule they put down the kitchens downstairs, but here it's upstairs.
It's not actually terribly convenient, I've spilled no end of stuff.
But the guy upstairs is never home, so I just spill things, and there's no one to see.
Oh, you really live here?
You asked me that last time.
I'll sort it out when when I've got some cash.
Are those CDs in the boxes down there? - I'll show you.
So.
It's a bus lane, you cunt!
This is Ian He'll be helping you tonight.
He worked a while at the Atlantic.
What day are we today? - Wednesday.
I'll see you later.
Do me a favor and put my coffee in the fridge, will you?
I'll finish it later.
Steve worked Saturday night at closing time, you had already gone.
This French bloke dropped off a CV a fortnight ago,
Seems OK ...
They all seem OK, maybe we should hire someone who wants to do this job
I'm surrounded by assholes who are doing this job only while they're waiting for something else to turn up.
Scratch the surface of any one of the fuckers, they turn out to be actors or dancers, or some pansy or other
I'm not kidding, I've had it up to here with these assholes who miss no opportunity to tell the front who they really are, what they're really into.
"Oh, where do you do your classes? "Isn't it difficult keeping up one's career?" That's made up, isn't it?
- Made up or not, it pisses me off.
Oh, right.
- A bar is not a restaurant...
Come the evening you can get a completely different customer in here.
Now I'm the head barman, which means that I get to do whatever I like to do, and you get to do whatever I tell you to, so you can forget what those people told you upstairs, you haven't got a week to get used to it,
Either you click right away, or not at all. Where's your vodka?
In the afternoon anyone can serve them their beer. It's not quite so simple in the evening.
And there's always someone out for your blood too...
You are slow! Oh Jeez.
You see that big guy over there in the suit?
He's been drinking since four o'clock this afternoon. Come closing time you've got to chuck him out.
See this woman coming along here now: she's the type that always orders the same thing, but she still needs you to ask her each time what she wants.
Been in evenings now for three months and she hasn't changed her record once.
Hello there sweetheart;
my you're looking cheerful today!
Do I have to dance on the table to get some attention? Okay, so what does she have?
Oh, she'll tell you ...
It doesn't include a tip.
Susan?
We're up here!
Dads, I love everyone.
Alex ought to come to my party, and he is not allowed.
Not allowed? But that's terrible ...
Who is Alex?
Alex, he's a prick.
Are you cold?
A little bit?
You're sure?
Now, I'm going to get you some tea in a minute.
Hurry up and come down stairs, we'll play.
All right.
The children are looking peaceful at the moment.
Yes, they're looking very well.
You do love them, don't you?
Cold? ...
Cold, but it's alright.
And next Wednesday ... is there a Wednesday too?
Well, is he what we need?
Oh he'll do. Customers like him.
G'night. - G'night.
Two vodkas on me.
The barman will do, buys his host a drink.
You know that woman who's always in here? The one you were chatting up the other day... Today she said to me, 'You're Joel's brother, aren't you?
She said what?
-'You're Joel's brother.'
I didn't give her a yes or no, but she took that as a yes.
Oh that's cool, I quite like the name Joel.
'Cause When I was little I used to listen to lots of Billy Joel.
Billy Joel?
Oh spare me.
How old are you, exactly?
Look, it was my sister, Who was not seventeen first of all. She had everything of his.
and I used to listen too. The stout! ...
Got any here? - Jesus Christ, come on, spare me.
How long have you been working here, then?
Since my eldest son was born, six years ago.
Before that I was a musician, like Billy, sort of ...
Funny, I'd never have guessed you had kids.
One day a year ago, I just walked out, went to stay with a friend.
Things can happen like that in life. Very simple things.
One night arrives which is the last you spend at home;
in a house, with a wife and family ...
Next morning, you just open the door and close it again.
And if the house is already empty, well that helped.
They had all left already, so that was a help ... You mean you didn't say anything;
you just split? Say what?
Billy Joel ... fuck you know ...
You say you were looking for somewhere to crash?
It's a fuckin' nightmare when you get nothing left and you got to start buying all over again. I didn't want want people to give me the gear.
Other people's gear makes me puke.
You want to piss me off good and proper, just drag me down to the local office-found.
This is all new, clean, unblemished, no past ...
Hey listen, drink?
No, let's have a look too, first.
Yeah, well, we'll have a look too.
Uh, my room in there...
No great interest, nothing to see. You've changed lots of things ...
Victor, was that there before?
Mind you, that's been there for ages!
Your room.
My room.
OK? Good? You like that?
OK.
What's wrong? - It's OK ... Good.
Hey, there's another room at Jay's place. - Oh, come on Victor, please!
Jay lives in a house now.
I told you, it's a room on the ground-floor; it's nothing like this place.
Anyway I don't need extra rent. Well, less than you fucking do ...
What the fuck do I know?
There are all manner of reasons why Jay here needs just as much bread as myself.
He keeps mum about it, but I can imagine ...
See, when you leave your family, they clean you out;
house, kids, bled dry ... that's what we are.
Are you living with anyone?
Are you a queer?
- What do you think?
You just fuck all over the shelf?
Victor, give the guy a fucking break, will you!
Jay and me, we were like two brothers here.
Old twins, that's us.
One or other of us could have been left by the wayside at any time, but no onward as one
And how many people can you say that about in a lifetime?
Jay and me, we've both done our share of drifting but at each bend in the road, we always did what we wanted to do.
And that makes one fuck of a difference.
Enthralled to our desires, that's us.
Victor is that impeccable gentleman, who rings your doorbell one evening and suggests: cable TV.
I can get you a very nice price if you fancy a wee set for your room. - Oh!
What is that?
Well, I guess the minute ...
Maybe you don't want a tenant, after all? OK, OK, - What?
- Victor needs money, he needs a space to crash.
Wait, it's so simple, you have to complicate it?
Then again, maybe it's me, maybe I've got the whole thing wrong ... We should drop the whole thing.
Fine by me, if you can help!
I have nothing against it.
I have my own life. Don't look to me for anything.
Victor provides the room first off.
Let's put the money on the table and that's that.
Cash, no checks.
My son told me he wants to go to art college.
When I was sixteen, I used to paint a pack...
Funny, eh?
You know it's not good for you to be on your own. Come on Victor.
If you're on your own, the moment there's trouble fucking head your way.
Jesus, would you just listen to yourself? - All right.
I don't need you setting me straight.
Thanks for dropping by.
And all that crap about twins too.
What is that shit? Oh, twins! Pisses me off!
Hello, Tommy!
- Hello, love.
Daddy?
- What, just a minute ...
What, what... Look.
Oh, you've had a little accident.
Maybe you'll do the same for me, some day ... huh?
Let's change these things.
Good.
Your eyes are upside down today.
Why do you say upside down?
'Cause when I turn like this ... See, they look like eyebrows.
Your head works both ways round.
On your Mother's side, they got big bags under their eyes like that.
Wait a minute, I think I can see...
No I haven't got those.
- Maybe one day. No I won't.
Wait, wait ...
What?
- It's all right.
Oh, Victor, what the fuck are you doing here?
Piss off!
Sorry, I know I should have called you.
I don't know where I got this idea that you never have anyone. Right?
It's bloody stupid.
Mind you, it's nice to have people around.
I used to like it.
Hey, your friend of yours, Ian, he never showed.
Did he say anything?
- I don't know.
You haven't got any gear knocking about?
I'm feeling a bit wasted ...
I don't use that stuff.
- Have you got everything you need here?
I can salt you out with cable whenever you want?
You never told me you were seeing someone.
"I'm not seeing anyone" you told me.
She's my landlady.
She was coming to check if I had everything I needed.
All right, yeah, yeah, I get it.
Personally I've always thought it's best not to have anything to do with those people.
It gets them kind of emotional and then you manage not to be able to ask for anything.
Like, when the heating fucks up, or ...
This place is fucking gigantic!
Is it just you here?
Something that your landlady does especially well, apart from freaking you out?
Have you seen the look in your face?
All right, two days, You can stay two days.
But that's all.
People all have their own faces, don't they?
Everyone manages to have a special one; it's great.
If I look at them I can see they're all different, But tomorrow, put me in the same carriage with the same people, I won't recognize a single one of them.
Will I see you on Friday?
Why, don't you want me to come? - Oh, Betty!
So how was your day, then?
- Nothing to write home about.
Have you got the tickets?
It's over there, downstairs.
You mustn't expect too much more. - What do you mean?
She seems all those things to you and me because she's ours; we love her.
We don't even know she's crippled anymore Don't say crippled.
You know, I never allow that word to be used.
Face facts, Mother. she is.
And that's not all.
- What do you mean 'not all? '
Laura is very different from other girls.
- I think the difference is all to her advantage.
Not quite all.
In the eyes of others, strangers, she's terribly shy, and lives in a world of her own.
And all those things make her seem peculiar to people outside the house.
Don't say'peculiar.' - Face the facts.
She is.
I don't intend to humor your silliness, Laura, so just sit down and compose yourself till they come.
Thomas has forgotten his keys, you'll have to let them in when they arrive.
Mother, you answer the door.
- I'll be in the kitchen, busy.
Oh, Mother, please, you answer the door.
Please don't make me do it.
That is your brother and Mr. O'Connor.
Will you open the door? , Laura
Mother, you go to the door. Please!
Can you give me one good reason ...
Oh, coming.
Just one second!
Why you should be afraid to open a door?
Laura Winfield, you march right to that door!
Yes, Mother. ...
Laura, this is Jim;
Jim, this is my sister Laura.
I did not know Shakespeare had a sister ...
Do you like it?
I don't know. I'm not into the theater at all. Ah ...
- They haven't got much space here, have they?
They aren't like a company that does different plays.
No, they take two each to a group of actors ...
How long have we got now? - Fifteen minutes.
Let me get the drinks. - Oh, no, it's all right.
A Guinness, please.
What will you have?
Thanks, I'll have a Coke.
Only a Coke?
- Just a coke, I'm working.
What would you like?
- Can I have a coke too please?
Just a coke?
Yeah, two cokes.
Mom was wicked tonight, wasn't she?
Yeah, Yeah - Whats that?
I thought Mom was wicked tonight.
He loves coming, you know, he'd come every night if he could.
You know, I'm watching it but often I'm really nervous, I'm thinking how will she get along or just going to trip over
Or I keep just checking around, making sure people are enjoying it.
But he'll watch it, watch the entire play. He's got a real knack for it.
Don't you? You really love it.
Here we go again, the second half ...
Do you like Tennessee Williams, yeah?
I've got to leave someone, and I don't know how.
Fucking out
- So what's the situation this time?
It's just a girl I'm seeing. She comes around. We fuck.
Without me asking to come back or anything like that.
Alright, I asked her around once, but ...
Well, What would you say?
It's crazy, right?
I mean, you suggest something just this once; they make a fucking habit of it.
Okay, it's not a hassle to me or anything to be ...
Actually, it is. That's exactly what it is, just that.
I think I find the ... yeah, a drag.
But only now, not before, but now, all of a sudden, it's become a real pain in the ass ... really quick.
I mean now, right this bloody Wednesday, the thing is like we owe it to each other or something.
It's all wrong.
She'll understand.
People do understand.
What would you do to end this?
Oh, I'd stay just the same. It breaks up by itself.
Still, can you believe how desperate that woman must be?
Wednesdays, two to, I don't know, four wanting that, and only that?
Who's to say she's any more desperate than you?
What do you mean. - Why should she be?
You didn't ask her to come back, and she didn't ask you if she could.
Even so, you open your door to her, and that's how it works.
Where's the desperation in that.
It's not so, when you come across someone who wants the same thing.
Maybe you give her a lot; you don't even realize it. Wait, how do you know?
You don't even know her.
But I can imagine her.
I'm sure you gave her a lot.
I do not know, I can hardly believe she wants the same thing that I want ...
I don't have the impression of being with anyone, either.
And what she says about all this?
- I don't know, we don't talk.
Victor? !
Well, your polish is all dried up.
- You shouldn't even be here to see it.
Fuck it. Why is it always the same with you?
I said two days, only.
I'm leaving tomorrow!
Today is Wednesday; you know you should not be here on a Wednesday afternoon, and in any case ...
Okay, all right, fine, well ...
you should have said so.
OK, fella, just leave ... - All right. - Now, come on.
If there was a problem, you'd tell me, right.
Are you not down at the pub?
Come on, I forgot the Pub; I'll only drink.
That's no solution.
Yeah, that's no solution ...
Hello, eh, you want to catch the show again?
Not surprised, such a pretty evening.
And here you are again, and that proves it.
It's not as if you're a real theater buff, right?
Do you work here?
Oh, no, no ... Looks like it, right, but no.
I've already forgotten what happened just there.
What?
-Oh, in theater ...
I think we don't talk about it after.
They see the show and they bugger off, just like that.
Makes her sad.
So I tell her: I'll hear what they say on the way out and tell you later.
I know,you're not supposed to give a toss and all that, but as a rule my wife does all right.
People really like her, you know, in principle ...
That depends on what part she's playing, of course ...
My wife's in the show.
Yeah, she's the one playing the girl, Amanda.
Laura.
- Yeah, Laura. I don't know any more ...
Anyway, I'm sure I told you this.
I'm a sot.
You know, personally, I can never really tell whether someone's good or bad. when I go to the theater.
The punt has got an opinion about everything.
It's really interesting.
But there I am , listening in at the interval and all of a sudden, bang, I ask questions.
And I don't feel like a twerp doing it.
Any one, whether it's someone from there or not.
Sure, but they don't know who you are, do they?
No, I mean the others in the company. They're used to see me around, you see.
I lend a hand from time to time.
You call me a wanker if you like, but I feel like a pig in shit.
This really suits you here ...
In more ways than one actually.
Being with her of course, because this passion of hers, it could cut her off from us.
It's true, isn't it?
If you really, really love something, you often end up ruling out something else, right.
Absolutely.
Yeah, well, I don't want her to fall victim to that, you know?
So Claire and I have decided not to rule out anything.
I'm Andy ...
- Jay ...
So she's called Claire?
Who?
- Your wife.
Didn't I tell you?
I told you all sorts of other things; I forgot the most important.
It must be pretty unusual, a bloke following it all, though, like you do.
I don't know, there's always doing a doing a job right;
I want to get some feedback, you know ... people to talk to me, but then again, maybe I'm the only one that it upsets ...
It becomes my job.
I drive a cab you see, black cab.
OK, so I got a fare in the back, I got a job to do ... but if we don't talk, I feel like I'm only doing half the job. You know, if we don't talk, if I don't talk to him. - Yeah, right ...
If you fancy a game?
Upstairs, downstairs? Start wherever you look.
That's what's good about it here.
And you, you married?
When you're with someone, there's only a very short time when you can really give each other things for free ... with neither of you having to ask.
Because later on, all you do is make demands of each other.
Perhaps the only difference between her and all the rest ... is that she's asking you for nothing.
But what have you learned?
You scare me ...
Haven't you learned anything at all from leaving home?
Perhaps I should only go out with people who fit in well.
Only a man would want all this, baring your wounds and all that shit;
it's not for me, just not my style.
She's seeing someone else, too.
And aren't you?
- Me?
No, not at all.
This woman, she's all I've got.
Where are you going?
A handsome guy just went by.
I'm off, if you don't mind.
Joan, hi.
Hi. - Joan, this is Claire.
Hi.
- So, did the tour go well?
I suppose so, like any other tour, bye ...
You know, a tour would suit me down to the ground.
It's just what I need to get my blood tingling.
All that moving around.
I don't look like a tart, do I? A tart?
No!
Tarts don't look like that.
It's just that I was at another casting session this morning and ...
I realized it's pretty murky at my place, so I tend to ..
Were there any calls?
So, you give classes? - Yeah, but to amateurs.
You could come one day, if you wanted. Sometimes something happens.
When they are?
Tuesdays and Fridays, but Fridays at three o'clock.
Okay Friday, I'll come on Friday.
You know, the first time we met, I found you a bit stuck up.
Like you were shittin' on us or something, but that's not right, is it?
Just the way you look.
Well then again, you know, some days it's a fucking life we all lead ...
it's all very well, the theater and all ... but I know full well she does too much.
But there you go ...
I was thinking, I was saying to myself the other day ...
People who are really fond of each other, I mean really fond of each other ... What could possibly come between them, and fuck everything up ... at some point or another?
What would you think?
Well, people who are in love, or just mates?
Oh no, I think, in love.
Or why not, maybe they're even lovers.
You for instance, Andy ...
What could possibly fuck up your marriage, once and for all?
You take a look at me, I've been working in this bar, waiting for something else to turn up, for ... I don't know, six, seven years now maybe.
I mean, at first it was just for a while, see ... but now I'm stuck in a rut like a fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, if I'm honest with myself ... the only time I can really say "'Jay said he'd do it and he did it" ... was when I left home.
Ah, so you are married.
Yeah, yeah. I thought of you the other day; it does ...
Except, when you have an idea like that, you tend to keep it to yourself, don't you.
When everything is going down the drain and all you can think is getting out, you keep that to yourself.
So who did you tell you were going to leave?
A couple of mates. One mate, actually.
Well, that's when it gets ugly, isn't it?
When you do that ... You know, you hurt people when you do that.
I mean, they get shit, yeah, that's an example.
That would really get to me.
Except when you're caught in the middle of it, Andy, you can't see anything.
It was really only when I was out on the pavement again ... that I could see how unhappy I was.
How low I'd sunk, pretty low in fact.
Because, after all, Andy, it's so very easy to stay ... Isn't it?
Don't you find that's how it usually goes with people?
What about you, how did it all start between the two of you?
What do you mean.
You mean, me and my wife?
What's going on here? Now hang on a minute.
That's private business.
I've got a big gob, right?
But not even he knows about it! Back off.
Right, boy?
Now get yourself a drink from Mozzie.
Don't go outside.
Put it on the tab.
You all right, Luke?
- Yeah, thanks.
Yeah.
- Yeah. - Good. Good man.
What would you think of a mother who has it off on the sly, regularly ... and then goes back home in the evening, as if nothing happened?
Goes back to her family ...
And all of that with a wicked gift for pretense ... because, I mean, how ...
How, can you after being fucked all day by some guy go home in the evening to your husband, to me, I mean, to Jay her husband, her family, as if nothing happened?
You want to know my opinion?
- Yeah!
Really?
- Yeah, I'd like that.
Well, I think ...
I think there's a lot of blokes around ... Like you.
That's no help to you, is it?
Because she's got to go back, hasn't she? In the evening.
Kiss the kids, give them a hug, pour herself a drink, pour a drink for the fuck wit sitting opposite her at the table
Maybe she's even got to talk about her day,
"A slightly tiring day, dear, of course ... but a really lovely day." ... after being shagged all day, by some ... some fucker who ...
On top of that, he doesn't even say a word to her.
Andy, play, fuck sake!
Else Jay here can take over, and I can find me a game somewhere else.
You know what, mate?
That was the moment that she looked at me with the most attention ...
Susan, my wife.
She'd come home every evening and she'd just eat me up with her eyes.
Give yourself a break, man ...
Because ... She's bound to compare, isn't she?
When she comes in the evening, and the fact is, she's there at your side, and she's happier than she's ever been before ...
Are you listening to me?
What do you think, though?
I say that as long as she comes home every evening, that's ... That's just fine.
Yeah, yeah?
All right, I'm not surprised you say that, and I don't even hold that against you.
No ... I think until you've lived through something like this Yeah, you do feel really sheltered, don't you?
Yeah, right ...
And then when it actually happens, you're not even surprised, are you? Right ...
Right?
So you're saying ... If we stay ... It's because we can't face it, right?
Oh fuck, I've got to get out of here.
I've a fucking bed to chase.
Was your wife seeing a total cunt, or what?
You said that you never said a word ...
Even you talk about it, you're so worked up it sounds more like you're the one that got dumped, right? Yeah?
Marriage, Jay, It's a wonderful thing.
It's a war, it's a battle, it's a terrible journey, but ... It's a reason for living.
I thought you were saying you couldn't play very well?
Ah, don't listen to him. It's not true.
Jay's not a bad player ...
You'll bounce back, I'm sure of that.
I've bounced back a bit already.
- I've got no worry on that.
I've bounced back, definitely.
Have you told about ... this woman I'm seeing once a week on Wednesday ... and we fuck?
I suppose it's better than nothing ...
She loves it though;
she's a really good fuck, too.
You're probably the sort that doesn't bother with that side of things ... but for me it really counts. Oh yeah.
What day did you say that you say you saw her?
- Wednesday.
That's a really good day for me, Wednesdays. Yeah ...
Yeah, I do really good business Wednesdays.
But then again Saturday is cool off.
What makes you think I'm not interested in a good fuck?
Because I don't mention it?
She's got a husband, you say?
I didn't say.
I don't know, actually.
That's a good question.
Fancy another game?
There's no performance tonight, just the two of us ...
There's no performance?
No, actually I was just passing through ... You know ...
Your wife in anything else on here?
Ah, no, come off it ...
No, tonight she's out giving her poxy fuckin drama lessons out in the fuckin sticks.
Victor, didn't you say you wanted me to help you with something today? What?
Oh yeah, yeah.
I was wondering if you would come to my insurance company with me.
But ... we can just stay home ...
Where are you going?
I got to go, I got things to do, you know.
But it's only two o'clock ...
Yeah, well I'm not going to sit around all day like a pillich.
It's not two, it's ten to.
And if you're staying and the bell goes, you don't answer it.
It won't go, but don't answer it anyway.
But this thing of yours, I mean ... we could both do it.
You were leaving ...
You didn't drop by last Wednesday.
I wasn't there. Oh good.
I couldn't.
We hadn't agreed, had we? Yeah ...
No ...
I know ... Yeah.
Let's go. ... Shall we go?
What?
No, not like this ...
The condom.
Gideon!
Pamina. let's go.
Pamina, let's go.
That's not touching.
She won't let me touch her butt, and I'm supposed to.
That's not touching. It's fumbling.
How can I carry on a love scene, if she doesn't want to love me?
We couldn't get here any earlier.
They were delivering our sofa bed.
Oh, and you've been trying it out, have you.
- Just concentrate on the scene. Carry on.
You mustn't go.
Can I kiss you? - Yes.
My little Betty ...
Why'd she call me little?
And I'm not Betty.
Oh, my little Betty Look into my eyes.
I can see little gold spots in your eyes.
Kiss me, give me a kiss.
- You give me a kiss.
I don't know why I bother ...
I have no idea.
Here we've go Betty as stiff as a board ... she has never touched anyone in her life. And Dave is arrogant as ever.
You're ridiculous!
I don't believe a word of it.
That's not a love scene. OK.
That will do. - They've known each other for ages. See?
I imagine there'd already been contact.
You know what I mean? No. This is the first time he's touched her .
He's bound to be. You picked a bad day.
- It's OK. They're great!
Maybe I don't have to do it this way ... but I am so into this, I get the feeling I'm Wilmer Todd.
Sometimes when you're so cool talking what you're going through ... you don't even clock the other person there.
You understand me?
- Carry on.
I need to speak to you, Betty.
Not here, alone, not here.
You come with me?
- I want to speak to you, too.
I want to kiss you, such long kisses ...
Such tender kisses ...
Where?
Your lips ... your body.
I mean: Where do you want me to come to?
To my home.
Come to my home.
When?
Stop it there. Call it a day. It's not working.
Next couple.
But last week, when we did in improvisation ... Well, you said that it was good.
I was already to fuck her just then!
Right then, I loved her!
What I know ... - No, you know nothing!
The thing I know, is that what you're supposed to be doing ... is to make Betty gather up all her things ... find an excuse to go out and put the whole of London to come and see you!
And wasn't I doing that?
- Who said it was so far away?
No one did! But it is.
It has to be.
I'm so glad, I really am.
You know, I was thinking of giving up.
I really was. I was really down on acting and you're not going to make any money and all that, but seeing that two ordinary people ...
I mean they were just brilliant, weren't they?
It was fantastic, renewed my ... I've forgotten something.
I have to go back. You go along.
Are you all right?
I'm just lonesome.
Someone ... close?
Was it sudden?
... Sorry.
Yes ... My little finger bends to one side, both of them.
It's what each hand has a mind of its own ... by the look of it.
Champ, after all, if you'd asked me ...
I would have said you were a real shit today to me just now.
But don't be sorry, someone torments me like that ...
But well, you know, Claire, the thing I admire about you is that in no time at all you can get on the wrong side of the whole group. I'm proud of you when you do that, it's not easy to be horrid.
Don't talk to me, Betty.
No one understands a thing when you talk.
OK. But you're in the right job.
And I know, because I have taken other acting classes, and this one ...
Let's the two of us stop being I guess with me ... I'm not understanding a word you're saying, you understand ...
OK.
Excuse me.
I'm bothering you.
You're not learning anything, Betty.
Still, neither am I.
We're not the sort to give up easily, right?
Look! I can be a real shit ... but you come back.
I'm useless, but I keep meeting people who think I'd be "Perfect" for the part, yeah, who say no.
When you're not gifted, you see, that's what you've got.
You keep at it. You don't let anyone down. You do your Tuesdays, your Wednesdays,
You just dabble with this and that. - Just dabble with us No ...
I mean ... with myself.
Come on, Vic ...
- What the fuck are you doing here?
Where'd you spring from.
Were you getting bored, was that it?
Oh, I didn't come to find you. Only came for the atmosphere.
Jesus, you make me ashamed!
It sounded so great on the phone, when they rang.
Oh, I got to hand it to you, choosing better places to die in every day.
It's three o'clock in the bloody morning, I'm doing my own thing.
So, fuck you, Jay! Get him out, for fuck's sake, he tried to beat me up.
He'll catch his death of cold. Me?
No, I never get sick.
Even beer doesn't keep me drunk these days.
"Just go home" that wanker said to me. Been expecting you.
What about the duck you had?
You want to talk to me like that?
Can't you see you're all taking a piss?
With your soaking trousers and your ass hanging out.
Why don't you take a bloody look at yourself?
When Jay is giving up on you, he doesn't even tell you.
He just carries on smiling, with his mind on something else as he walks away.
There's a few phonies out there.
You can exploit people, you can be ungrateful ... and at least you can live with it, you know.
Look, I can't figure it out.
What do you know about life?
Have you ever lived with anyone?
My life is fine, back off!
Jay keeps single to everything.
He doesn't even say who he's fucking.
You 're always complaining, but Jay's worse off than you.
'Cause you, in fact, you do all kinds of things, and you get it out of your system.
Jay makes himself ill.
Perhaps he doesn't know how to love.
Maybe it never got to him. It doesn't everyone.
Why do you say that?
Little cunt ...
Fuck you both.
You know Vic, I swear, I think I've got Alzheimer's.
I'm not kidding.
I think i've got, feel this, feel this right there.
What is that?
Hay, hay ... look, look, the one on the left, giving you the eye.
She must be a better fuck than your landlady.
I knew the singer in college, we were friends. He was a really nice guy, you know, really clever.
I think his band was really good too.
They were never to go very far ... but I think that there was actually something there, you know, a basis.
There's such a character, that stupid guitarist, he was so mouthy, you know, always just like uh uh ...
And such a massive ego.
But they kicked him out, and after that he became a drummer. Funny that you should know them.
- So, this is your place, then?
Yeah, we used to live three streets from him with a friend, but we fell out.
Funny, it's real hard, because at the same time we were absolute best friends.
Natasha, you saw her earlier. I like her, but it's not the same.
Don't you think it takes time to get to know people? I mean, really know them.
Perhaps you and I will be really good friends too, I don't know ...
And, you see, I really like it here. This is my place, I decorated, you know.
I put it together myself ... and when people see it, they know something about me
They see the walls, they see what I have here, they see my things ... and they see a bit of me,you know, but ...
Come on.
What? - Come here.
- Come here. Stay here with me and dance.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me!
It's locked ...
You really are an old fart ...
What's inside the chicken, boys?
Have some more chicken.
You do not like the skin?
You're sure you don't want anything? No ...
No.
It's a while since I've seen you boys. Right?
I've brought these back for you.
I mean, it's Wednesday, right?
Is she pretty?
Who is she?
It's no one you know.
So, what are you gonna do?
- Look after myself. That's what I'm going to do.
After all, someone has to ...
OK, boy.
Bye bye. - Bye
Everything OK?
And you?
What will you have, Jay?
- Hello, game later on?
Enjoy your second half.
It's much funnier than the first.
It's a bit shorter as well, so you got more time to have a drink afterwards.
Hello, Jay! - Hi Andy.
How nice to see you, you're becoming a bit of a regular.
Well, enjoy the second half, it's good.
I should finish this fag ...
You just can't take that second half, can you.
It stopped raining ...
Where does the music come from?
From Paradise Dance Hall across the alley.
- We'll cut a rug this week
Or is your program filled up? Let me have a look.
Every dance is taken. I'll just have to scratch some out.
A waltz!
- I can't dance ...
That inferiority stuff ... - Come on, just try.
- I'm going to step on you.
Hold up your arms a little, leave it to me ...
Let yourself go now, Laura. Let yourself go.
Come on, come on.
Hey, that's lots better.
- Am I?
Much better!
What did we hit?
- A table.
Did something fall off it?
I think so. - Yeah. I hope it wasn't the little glass horse with the horn.
Oh. It broke?
- Now it's just like the other horses.
It's lost its - horn.
It doesn't matter. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
He'll never forgive me, I bet that was his favorite piece of glass.
Come on, two hands are better than one.
I'd still like you to meet my wife. Come on.
This is Claire, my wife.
Hello, Jay. - The great actress, as you know.
Oh, back again, are you Andy. - Jay's a real theater buff.
Even though he's hardly seen anything.
- What you mean, hardly seen anything?
He always leaves during the interval.
- Boys! You don't look like an agent ...
Have you called in to see if we're all right, is that it?
Shame, all my best scenes are in the second half.
Jay's ... There's a big, big Tennessee Williams fan.
Personally, I wouldn't go that far myself.
All the women in them always seem so hysterical, don't they?
Jay's that bloke I was telling you about.
He left his wife. - He hates her now.
I'm sure I mentioned to you.
He sees this woman, sees this woman once a week.
And not only sees her, if I understand right ...
OK, I'm going up..
Good night everyone.
- Night, Claire.
- Good night, Love.
Andy. - Oh yeah, shoes ...
Bless you.
All right, I'll see you in a minute. Back in a sec.
I haven't finished dressing.
I'll be there straight away.
See you there Nice meeting you.
Stay for a drink?
Want me to shut this?
I mean, at one point, the fact that you never said anything. I wondered. A woman who keeps her trap shut so much
All those scenes I was hiding; scary, isn't it?
Look, you know?
Fucking reassuring, Very reassuring.
Vows, fidelity, support, faithfulness ... the whole works. Why should you miss out on all that?
You'd have been the first woman who ever had.
That's not why I'm here, though. that's not why I'm here, you know.
At one point, just to make it very clear where I'm coming from ...
At one point I thought that if what we did together was all that you wanted, it was because you knew more than me.
I thought you'd found something. I thought you were ahead of me and that in the end you would tell me what you knew.
That was the really great thing, that some fucking point in the future you would tell me what you knew.
But, of course, you just keep your gob shut.
What the fuck are you doing with him?
- He's my husband.
You wanted to talk?
Well then, here we are ...
Talking.
So then, you're an unhappy bloke who's managed to bounce back.
Is that it?
Well if it's good, What can I say?
It's good actually... See you at least one last time,
Otherwise I might have been worried, like some stupid cow.
Hey. Back there for a minute you looked really sad ...
But think of everything that's yours, everything that you're going back to your family, and your kid, and your husband that loves you so, and a job in the theater that you so love ...
Everybody listens to you, don't they?
Everybody listens to you.
Even me. I don't even know you, you don't even know me, and here I am listening to you, interested in you.
In some fucking half-assed little theater that stinks of piss.
Jesus Christ ... It's all your game, isn't it?
I didn't picture you like this ...
You didn't picture me like this?
What a fucking game you are. That first day you must have been really surprised. I thought everything...
I didn't seem to make a big deal out of it. That ... that didn't seem to hurt me that much, you not saying anything ...
I didn't give you do not saying anything a second thought.
You didn't picture me like this?
You didn't picture me like this? I didn't picture you at all.
Right. It's much simpler for me, and now every thing's settled in one go.
Well that's fine. I like it when things are over and done. No time wasted.
I'll be back in a second.
Mom was good tonight, wasn't she?
But she's always good, isn't she.
No, it's Dad ... He says she's "uneven."
But he can't talk, since he only goes to the first few nights. So he can't really compare.
I like seeing the play lots of times, because I don't always understand everything the first time.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Like a girl you like a lot at school?
How are things going between the two of you?
Well ... - Come on, we're off now. Come on.
Say goodbye.
What about Thursday?
When you're in mourning, you know ... all the more reason, I think, to carry on as usual.
That's the only of handling it.
But then, again, ... can't you say to the bloke who runs the evening classes Someone's died, after all!
You know, Betty, actually, no one has died ... actually died.
Well, if no one has died, that must mean it's you.
But if you feel like you're going to die, I'd rather be with you, no question.
In fact, I'm flattered to be here.
when I died there was no one there.
I had to go through the whole thing on my own.
OK. I did it, but a bit of company won't hurt.
Perhaps I should be getting back ...
So, in principle, if you're serious, they have a program the day you die.
having a laugh with the kids ... we did that last night.
Then comes going to tell someone something something you're dead set on, for good or bad, something you'd never have said.
'Cause on the day you die, you have total freedom of speech.
In principle ...
I met a man ... not like me, I don't know how to use my energy but he does; he's really determined.
And then one day he found out how to turn it against me.
And just like that, he took back everything he had given me.
That's what he wanted, I think, to screw everything up.
And it worked.
Between the two of us, it worked.
What was it, the day you died?
It's in the past
It's fine, you know.
There's no more to say about it.
Thank God ...
Claire says she wants to give up the acting class.
I'm all upset.
- She's just a bit tired, that's all.
She gives too much of herself, you see.
I'm always telling her... It's like these classes she gives. It's always out in places where the train takes longer to get to than the time she spends doing the classes.
That's a bit confusing, but you know what I mean.
There you go. There's nothing you can do about it.
Claire's like that. It's like when she decided to have a go at acting. The age she was, she's no spring chicken.
and she'd never really done it before, but ... There you go. Straight forward, didn't you.
And when we met ... I was ... No thanks ...
Well, I hadn't any plans ...
But she saw me.
She chose me Bang! Made a beeline straight for old Andy.
Very strong people ... can do totally incomprehensible things.
Right?
I'll go shake a leg.
I'm Glad you came.
- I'll be off, then.
We'll drop you off.
This is it.
Thanks.
See you Tuesday.
Betty's nice, isn't she?
I'm very fond of her now.
I'm not going to leave, or anything.
OK?
Claire's telling Andy she's going to stay with him.
Fine.
I wasn't worried.
So, did you find you Jay, or did he come looking for you?
I don't give a shit about all that!
You know what the saddest thing is?
You know what hurts the most, you know what it is?
You'll never be an actress!
Never! It isn't easy for me to say that. It isn't fun.
I really wonder what good you do your students.
Well, they seem to like you.
All the same, for some, that's something for the want of anything better.
I've got a share, my part in this. Haven't I?
I mean ... because I never really believed in it from the fucking start ... not one minute!
No, but I dove in, both feet first, like a fucking idiot. People have your fantasies, the little girl who doesn't know what she'll do and ends up doing just about anything.
like a stupid prick, driving a cab around day-in, day-out.
As for that fucking moron ... you know, who thinks he's so smart, one of these days ...
- There's a fare for you there.
You know What?
I'm not even surprised.
You remember that look on your face, when we first met?
I could see that same torment on your face now.
Since you right!
You are the least alive person I know.
I being with Jay is in fact a great opportunity for you, right?
A pathetic little piece of adultery. Of course you have to be against something like that. Who wouldn't be?
Oh, it's OK. Andy's just a sod, but he knows London like the back of his hand.
You don't even know who I am!
You don't even know how to hurt me.
If you knew me a little bit longer, what you call my lack of talent, sure it makes me suffer, but it won't kill me!
You can't choose any look, this stuff's a solid week ...
Same again , please.
You know, if you were doing this job properly, you wouldn't have time to notice how I look.
Great place. Great place.
Give me a beer?
Actually, it's like seeing a whore, right?
seeing this woman one day a week, not speaking ...
Yeah. But she found a way of telling you she was married, didn't she?
She's very good, for things like that! Just don't get carried away.
I'll bet she's done it before, no way you're the first.
I stopped.
I don't see her any more.
I was about to suggest we share her.
but it sounds like there's nothing left to share, right?
One day a week, that wouldn't fuck up my marriage, would it?
Just kidding, I'm just kidding you ...
I love her more and more as time passes.
Just wanted you to know that.
Ian, have you got any black bags?
- Yeah. I bring them down.
Don't ask me. I'm going to head off.
Oh yeah ... Okay ... Cheers.
Well, I'm going now...
I'll just get my jacket from downstairs.
I thought that perhaps you'd said something at one point that I didn't hear, and that's what you're holding against me.
Listen, I don't understand the first thing about you. How can I hold anything against you?
Did I miss something? What did I miss?
You wanted to ask me something?
Anything you like. Go on. All right, I'll ask you something.
It wasn't worth it, was it? All that fuss for nothing.
Still, I don't know. Maybe that's how it works between you two.
You tell him each time, and then that's it ...
I mean, for Chri ... you weren't like someone who you ask to drop by who comes by, and fucks, and goes, and just for the thrill of it.
What was I meant to feel?
Who was I supposed to be like? Who should I have been ... to keep everyone satisfied just to come and see a man and bury myself in his arms, because I wanted to?
It's been a long time since I wanted someone.
And it was with you that I wanted to start again.
Not supposed to say that usually, are you?
I know you've given me something that I never asked for. and that no one does that, ever, and that I should be grateful.
And yet, somehow, all I seem to do is to hold it against you.
that you should be so close to someone ... tears me apart.
Your being close tears me apart.
I'm a divorced man. I have two children. who are getting used to me not being around.
I suppose I'm their best friend. That's something.
And also I'm this "Wednesday" man to a woman ...
who I've never asked anything of, and she's happy with that, that's no problem to her
But it really fucks me up
Everything.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
Sorry ...
You missed nothing, Claire.
You missed nothing ... because I said nothing.
I didn't know it would be like this.
I didn't know that I would become so closely tied to you.
I thought it would just blow over.
Stay with me ...
If you've come back, stay.
Come back.
Stay ...
Now ...
Stay now.
No, Jay.
Have you left him?
Sorry, but I have to be off now.
Are you dumping this?
Sorry ... I'll come back to finish up later.
I'm going.
Mrs Larson?
It... lt won't be much longer, Mrs Larson.
Well, is he in a lot of pain?
No. No, no. There will be no more pain for your husband.
He's heavily sedated.
OK. I think I'm gonna go send little Hal in now.
No. No, no. I don't think that's such a good idea.
With all the painkillers, the reverend's not exactly himself.
Look, I think my boy has a right to say goodbye to his father.
I mean, the man means everything in the world to him.
Well, your call.
Nurse?
Yes, Reverend Larson?
- Did you see the cowboy? - The cowboy?
The cowboy who gave me the singing nickel in Pudding Town?
OK. I think it's time to turn down the morphine drip.
Reverend Larson, your son is here.
OK, sure. Send her in.
Ladies?
A little privacy.
Dad?
It's me, Dad. Hal.
Glad you're here, kiddo.
Got a few things to tell ya.
First, I want you to promise that no matter what you do in life, you will never ever settle for average.
Yes, sir.
Second, don't be satisfied with routine poontang.
Don't do what I did.
I married for love, and your mother Betty has been a nightmare.
But, Dad, Mom's name is Marian.
Listen to me. I'm giving you pearls here.
And third, find yourself a classic beauty
with a perfect can, and great totties.
That will put you in good stead with the Lord. lt's all in here.
Yes, sir.
Hot young tail's what it's all about.
I'll make you proud, Papa.
Jackass, can you not hear me down there?
I don't want anything to do with you, you little warthog.
You had me at "Get lost."
- What's up, Mauricio?
- Hey, Hal.
- How's the crowd tonight?
- Good. I got a few bites.
- Can I get you a drink?
- l won't say no to that.
Two beers.
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.
So, I didn't expect to see you here.
Where's your new girl Loni?
- Lindy. - Lindy.
- There you go. Actually, I didn't tell her I was goin' out tonight.
Why not?
Things OK with you guys?
Yeah, a little too OK, ifyou know what I'm talkin' about.
- What does that mean?
- Things are going in the shitter real quick.
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?
- She's not. I'm dumping her.
- You're dumping Loni?
- Lindy.
- What, are you crazy?
Lindy's gorgeous.
On the surface, but when you get to know her better, there's a whole other story goin' on.
Yeah? How goes that?
We're sitting there, you know, and she's got her bare feet up on the couch, and I notice that her second toe is, like, half an inch longer than her big toe.
- That's it? You're breaking up over that?
- Hey, I don't need that circus shit.
Well, couldn't she get the toe filed down or something?
What, then I'm dating a nub?
I'm starting to think we're jinxed here.
- Speak for yourself, my friend.
- What, you got the promotion?
I don't hear till tomorrow, but guess who is now officially going out with Jill.
Jill? Your neighbour Jill?
You're going out with Jill, your neighbour?
And she doesn't exactly hate me.
Get out!
You are the luckiest man on the planet.
So what are you doing here?
She's hostessing until 11. I better get going.
I'm gonna try to catch her on the way home, see if she wants to get a drink.
If I know you, that's not all she'll be gettin'.
See you later.
- l said no.
- No?
Why not?
I don't wanna have a drink with you. I wanna go home. ls that so hard to understand?
- What's goin' on?
Are you mad? - No, I'm not mad. I just...
Go on, say it.
You know what?
No matter what it is, we're gonna work it out.
Hal, I'm not attracted to you.
So what?
You think everyone who goes out is attracted to each other? Get real.
They're attracted to each other in the beginning.
Oh, come on.
That sounds like a bunch of New Age hooey.
Maybe for some people there's a little spark in the beginning, but for most, the attraction part happens way later. Whoa!
What?
That's it? Just like that, we're breaking up?
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days. That's all I need.
- Why do you need five days?
- Tomorrow I'm finally getting my promotion.
There's gonna be parties, dinners, this, that. I need you now.
Hal, you're gonna be so busy, you won't even think about me.
How am I not gonna think about you?
You live right across the hall.
I don't know, Hal.
Maybe you should think about moving.
Hal, we've made a decision regarding that wholesaler position.
Yes! It's about time, Dave.
We decided to go with the gal from Merrill.
She's a proven entity. A big producer.
- l'm sorry, man. - No, it's...
The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?
- Hal, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.
- You should have gotten it. You deserved it.
- No, I didn't.
I didn't put them in a position where they had to promote me or lose me.
It's a good lesson.
Make yourself indispensable, that's the key.
And to make matters worse, Jill dumped me last night.
Dumped you? Don't you have to be going out to get dumped?
- What does that mean?
- Well, I just thought it was more of a...
Anyway, why do you care so much?
Jill wasn't right for you and you know it.
How can you say that?
She was perfect.
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.
And by the way, her tits weren't even real.
Well, I could squeeze 'em. That's real enough for me.
Hal, I don't understand how a guy who's as nice and loyal and generous as you could have such a huge flaw.
What are you talking about?
It never occurred to you that picking girls on their looks may not be the best way?
Am I supposed to apologise for having high standards?
High standards? In the five years I've known you, every woman - l should say girl - you've gone after has been completely out ofyour league.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She doesn't mean anything by it.
She's just saying you're not that good-looking.
Oh! I thought she was implying something really mean.
No.
Hey, it's you.
You're the TV guru guy.
- Yes, Tony Robbins.
Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah! Oh, man!
So, wow! You gave advice to whatchamacallit.
- President Clinton? Mandela?
- No, no, no.
