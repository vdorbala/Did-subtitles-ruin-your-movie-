No, man. And now you've been going around with Big Ass.
You talking about Linda from Parkview?
- Yes, Big Ass.
Hey, hey! Slow down right here.
Slow down.
She a ho, huh?
- What?
I said, she a ho!
- No!
Yo, Billy. Go.
- Stop!
Stop! What the hell you doing?
Billy, stop this car, man!
J.D.?
What the hell's wrong with you man? What the hell's wrong with you, fool?
I knew it.
- Get that flashlight out of my face!
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
I thought you said "go."
- I did not say "go"!
I remember the last thing we were talking about was Linda from Parkview... and you said she...
- "Ho"!
I said, Linda is a ho!
Get the goddamn chain!
Come on, man!
Let's go!
Come on. Move it!
Pull the chain, fool!
Take the moneybag, let's do it!
Come on.
We're about to get paid, baby!
Let's go.
We're about to get paid!
- I'm gonna get this.
This ain't Christian, but it's gonna do.
Come on get in!
Throw it up in there!
Go!
What the hell?
- Cars ain't made like they used to, man.
What did you tie it to?
- What?
Get out and get it!
- Why I got to get out to get it?
Get it.
All right, here we go, baby!
Let's go.
- Here we go, baby! Here we go!
Come to Daddy!
The future's behind us, baby!
That is our future behind us.
No!
Calvin, what are you doing?
- Hey, baby.
Trying to get this studio together so we can finally make money off this stuff.
That's what you said about the T-shirt company and Herbalife vitamins.
Why you gotta bring that up?
That's in the past.
This is a whole new venture for us, baby.
Really?
Look, let me show you something.
Can I show you something?
- Yes.
Let me show you.
- You've got a picture.
Yes.
- Okay.
See that?
That right there is Oprah's guesthouse.
That's just the guesthouse.
So, if Stedman act up, this is where he gotta sleep.
Okay.
Why do you have this?
Because that's what I'm gonna buy for my baby.
Both my babies.
As soon as I get somebody, rent out the studio, make a platinum CD... and we get paid.
You don't like strangers coming in and out of the shop.
You want to have them coming in and out of the house?
It's 7:00. You gonna be late for work. You better come on.
I got some eggs for you.
You better come on and get 'em.
That damn shop.
Boy, they sure know how to kill a man's dreams.
Come on, Stedman.
Calvin!
Come here.
What was that for?
Well, it has been a whole two years since you took over the barbershop.
I mean, look at you.
You have hung in there.
Baby, you have no idea how proud I am of you.
You know, your father would've been proud of you, too.
Come here.
Okay, go.
- All right, I'm going.
Stay off your feet, okay?
My store! Look at my store!
It has been destroyed!
Get away from my shop!
Get away!
No! No! No!
Get away from my store!
Hey, yo, brother!
- Get out!
Brother!
Stay strong, brother!
Yeah, stay strong.
Get out of here!
Go on!
Calvin!
It's always something on a Saturday, isn't it?
What's up, Janelle?
You know Tanesha Jenkins' boy got a drug problem.
You think he did that?
- Damn, girl, you gossiping already?
First get your shop open. Then start the rumors.
I know you are not talking to me about how to run my shop.
I don't tell you how to run your business over there.
Anyway....
Hey, did you hear...
That's why your nose so big. You too damn nosy.
Hey! Did you hear about Clarinda?
Her husband caught her in a prime hoochie-koochie with another man!
Hey, man.
- Calvin.
How you doing?
- Fine.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
- Hey, what happened across the street?
You know this neighborhood.
It's getting worse every day.
How's Jennifer?
- She getting big.
You know. Mean, too.
So, got some good news for me?
- No.
Calvin, I need a cut like Ronnie's last week.
Little off the top, long in back, slope to the left like Gumby.
Munster front, Wyclef right.
Hook that up for me.
- You got any money, Lamar?
I'm gonna pay you back.
I got a Job interview.
When you get that job...
- Come on, Calvin, don't do me like that.
Just a little edge on there.
- I don't cut hair for free.
Out the door!
Calvin, your father would have hooked me up.
Go get hooked up.
Come on, dog!
Don't do me like that, Calvin!
See what I got to deal with every day?
- I know, but...
No. Get out of here.
Go!
So, what did they say?
The bank's not gonna give you another loan.
We've already given you a small-business loan... and a grant that you used on your other businesses.
Calvin, you know I want to help you.
But if you don't pay the property taxes, the bank is gonna foreclose on the shop.
I'm sorry.
There's nobody you can talk to?
Calvin... it's not gonna happen.
All right.
Hey, what can you do?
I appreciate you coming by.
I really do.
Don't worry about it.
How did you do this for 40 years?
I gotta do my own thing.
Hey, how you doing, Mr. Wallace?
Yeah, this is Calvin.
You know, over at the shop?
I was wondering, was you still interested in what we talked about the other day?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll see you then.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.
Okay.
You got it?
- Yeah.
We gonna get paid.
I never knew money could be so heavy.
Hey, slow down.
You all right?
- Yeah. Okay, I got it now.
Hell, no, man.
- What?
Hey, what's up, big guy?
- What's up, player?
Hey, this is my grandmama's oxygen machine.
She can't breathe without it.
Let us through.
You see us carrying this thing.
Move out the way.
Come on, man.
This thing heavy.
See, you do this all the time, man!
Billy, come on.
- No, man, he do this all the time!
My mama's trying to come back, and he is doing that.
It don't make no sense.
That's cool.
Just take it down.
Kevin, come open this door!
Kevin!
What's wrong?
Why didn't you answer the door?
You knew it was me!
I worked a double last night.
I Just got home two hours ago.
Don't play with me, Kevin.
Where is she?
Let's not do this again.
- Where is she?
Wait.
You ain't finished.
Why don't you look under the bed?
Go ahead.
I bet you I would hide a woman under that bed.
If you gonna look....
I'm sorry.
Terri... do I look like I'm thinking about somebody else?
I don't know.
You want to know how I really feel about you?
Just think about that Babyface song.
Which one?
You know, there are a lot of Babyface songs.
No.
- All of them, baby.
You know I do.
Come on.
I got some time.
Come on, real quick.
Yeah.
- Well, real quick.
Come on.
- Okay.
No.
- Let me take my jacket off.
Come on.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, let me take my jacket off.
What are you doing?
No, I'm just helping you get your jacket off, baby.
Who is she?
I don't know.
When I'm finished with her, you'll remember!
I can't believe you got someone.
You gonna make me catch a case before I go to work?
Where you going?
- Nowhere!
Get up!
I dare you!
Honey, cover your face now.
Hey, how can I help you today?
Okay.
I want a grande, triple non-fat, half-decaf... soymilk, French roast, caramel cappuccino.
Now, with just a splash... just a splash of hazelnut.
Okay?
And orange extract.
The extra foam in a separate cup.
I'll have to spoon it on myself because y'all never get it right.
You understand?
Thank you.
Asshole.
You have to find the guys, Officer.
- Okay.
We'll take you inside and get your information.
We'll be right with you.
Look at my store!
Then I walked in like pah-dow!
Know what I'm saying?
Ass so big, it look like two midgets in a sleeping bag!
Tyrone.
Can we talk about something other than big, fat, Juicy asses, please?
We could talk about something else.
- But why?
When does a woman just have too much ass?
Ass is like money.
You can never have too much. Hey, Ricky.
Just the man I want to see.
Hey, Ricky, yo!
School these boys on your philosophy about ass because they can't distinguish... between a woman with a big ass and a big-ass woman.
Hold tight.
It's mathematics, cuz. It's the ratio.
Now if you measure around a woman's waist, right?
Measure around that ass, you come up with a ratio about 3-5.
Okay.
Now that means that a 24-inch waist... is gonna yield a 40-inch ass.
The mathematics is correct, right?
- That's good, right?
You with me?
- Yo.
So give me an example.
I mean, break it down.
Okay, all right.
Jennifer Lopez.
Right?
Woman with a big ass!
Now, on the other side, we got...
- Right.
Mother Love.
Big-ass woman!
Good morning.
What's up?
Hey, you have any idea who poked that hole in Samir's store?
No.
You sure about that?
Just playing with you, man.
Hey, how you doing, Detective?
What's going on across the street?
I'm on this convenience store thing, so somebody's getting locked up.
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Ricky here?
No, he'll be in a little later, though.
You don't think he had nothing to do with that.
Ricky's been keeping his nose clean ever since he's been working here.
Hey, Rick.
Come in the back?
- That's my girl.
Yeah.
She got big drawers.
That's all right, though.
Is this chair free?
I figured not.
You mind just trimming me up a little bit?
Why you come over here, dog?
Why you sweating me?
- Are you sweating, Richard?
You're a two-time felon.
One more, it's all over for you, brother.
Calvin went out on a limb for you with this Job, man.
I mean, why you want to play him like that?
We got a surveillance tape from the camera at the check-cashing place next door... and by the end of the day, I will know something.
You understand?
Later, Calvin.
- All right.
Yeah.
Yo, I got to go, man.
All right, man?
I love you, boo.
See you later, baby.
What's up, man?
All right.
What you singing?
- What?
What are you singing at?
Mind your business.
Here come Jumbo Mutumbo!
Where I come from, to have girth is a sign of opulence.
What the hell did he just say?
- He said in Africa, fat people got loot.
I heard they circumcise women, too.
- How you gonna do that?
Anything that's extra, they just clip it off.
- Come on.
All right, fellas, I'm free.
Who's next? - Not me.
Not me.
I'm cool, man.
- Forget you.
Thought you had a Negro membership card?
Soaked up some BET, memorized some Tupac.
Shut up, Jimmy.
Calvin wouldn't give me a chair if I couldn't cut heads.
Three days, front chair, no customers.
What's up?
Kill that noise.
You know everyone starts out in the first chair.
That's exactly where you started.
Listen up!
I don't want no trouble!
Just give me your wallet and your Jewelry, won't be no problem.
Hey, don't you make me....
What's wrong?
You one of them rappers?
What's that?
You got a Rolex or a platinum chain?
Eddie.
- What?
Get your ass here.
Leave the boys alone!
Sit your old ass down!
You read him?
That boy almost turned over the money!
You all right, brother!
You all right!
Shaking, shaking a little bit!
He was shaking like booty meat!
Wasn't it good?
I had him.
I had him shaking like Don Knotts in a card game or something.
Remember, we're raising money for Johnnie Brown's raggedy shoes.
Scout will be here!
I need $20.
Let's give it up.
Come on.
You all right.
We need some more money.
We need it right now.
You smell good, Terri. ls that Obsession?
Five minutes.
What'd she say? - Hey, man.
Where you going?
You see that attitude?
She can't cut my hair.
I'll be back later.
Don't be scared.
- I'm free.
I'll cut your hair.
No, I'm straight, dog.
Motherfucker.
Who drank my apple juice?
Y'all don't hear me?
Who drank my goddamn apple juice?
Terri!
Stop cussing!
This ain't Def Comedy Jam.
I put a big-ass red...
- Terri!
Stop cussing!
I put a big red sign saying:
"Do not drink me."
Maybe no one drank it.
Maybe it evaporated.
I'll slap you.
Don't get on my bad side.
You've been here just a minute.
Girl, it's not like a bottle of Hennessey or nothing!
It's just some funky-ass apple juice.
- This is my funky-ass apple juice.
I don't touch nobody else's stuff--
Hey, Terri....
- What?
Jimmy drank your apple juice.
Hey, hold up...
- Why'd you touch my apple juice?
Excuse me.
- I don't want your cooties.
Did you see me drink it?
- I didn't have to, you asked about it.
Do you have ocular proof?
Did you see me?
"Ocular"?
- What'd I just say?
I said I didn't have to see you drink it...
- Oh, shit.
I don't have to see you...
- What'd you see?
Say you ain't drink it.
- Did you see...
Knock his college ass out!
Hey! Come on!
Come on!
No, Calvin, let them go!
This ain't the projects.
This is a place of business.
Calvin, your father wouldn't put up with this mess.
You have to handle this.
Checker Fred, just sit there and play checkers.
Do I look like my father?
- Yeah.
Yes, you do.
- In the nose, right here.
DVDs, CDs.
Not today, man.
Whatever you want, man.
Got the new DMX, baby!
Just go on out, go.
Put somebody out. Always.
I'm never coming in this shop again.
It's a possibility that Jimmy drank your apple juice.
Small possibility.
But nobody saw him.
You didn't see him.
So all you can ask...
That's not fair, you're taking his side.
I'm not taking his side.
Ask the man.
If he says yeah, kick his ass, if he says no, then squash it.
Ask him.
Did you drink my apple juice?
Did you?
lnquiring minds want to know.
Did you?
Nope.
Answered, done deal.
Come on, let me buy you some apple juice.
Case closed.
Well, one of y'all MFs drank it.
I'm tired of y'all, I swear!
Y'all better not touch my stuff no more!
Stop slamming them doors!
I know it wasn't me.
I'm lactose intolerant.
Hey!
- Hey, girl!
Damn!
It's cool.
Man, she messed up your whole arrangement.
How much them roses cost?
$2 or $3?
I'm Crazy Howard.
Topping the news, last night someone stole the new ATM machine....
'Cause people can't raise their kids....
Gabby!
I tell you, the first thing I'll do, Joe.
Player, you lock your door?
- Yeah, I ain't stupid.
Come on.
Then why's your sister in the room, man?
- I'll tell Mama!
No.
What?
Close the door, dog!
This is just a big video game!
No, it ain't.
It looks like a cash machine to me.
And this ain't no supermarket, so I'm gonna tell Mama.
No!
You can't tell nobody about this, you hear me?
Why not?
'Cause I said so.
I mean, think about it.
Gabby, who'll take care of you?
- My mama.
She got you on that.
- What can I do to keep your mouth shut?
You gotta pay me.
- Pay you?
I'm getting a headache.
I just paid you $10!
I don't care!
- Hey, dog, whup her ass.
You can't touch me.
I'll whup her ass.
- No, man, don't do that.
You better give me my cash back later...
- I'll give it back!
Take it, girl.
That's all I got.
Go on, get out of the room there, girl!
Go on!
Get on!
That's how you lock a door, dog.
What?
- It's your fault, man!
Now we've gotta take this someplace else.
I've gotta think how.
- The same way we stole it, the truck.
I said I'm not messing with my crazy-ass cousin no more.
He too violent.
He comes from a broken home.
He don't even know his mama.
And after last night... I ain't messing with that fool no more.
We wouldn't be doing this if you'd locked...
- I did lock the door.
Your sister's a demon child.
- Whatever, man.
Your mama don't have real silverware, so we could get in here?
Whatever.
Oh, come on, man. Let's just take it up.
Hey, Billy, take it down.
Wait a minute....
Take it down.
Come on, player.
Come on, big man.
We'll get you this time.
Push it through.
My finger!
This ain't gonna fit.
My hand!
My hand!
You got it?
- I don't have it.
This is good chicken, too.
You ever had this chicken?
How can you sit there with all that chicken and not offer us any?
I paid for this.
You give me a quarter, I might give you a little mashed potatoes.
How come he can eat out front, while we...
- 'Cause Eddie's old, man.
You see that right there?
You know what that means?
That means I've got senroyity.
S-who?
- Senroyity.
Don't you mean "seniority"?
Whatever.
That's nothing but gray hair poking up out your follicle. lt means nothing.
Don't mean anything?
Let me tell you something, boy.
I was here in '68 when they robbed and burned down... everything here but this barbershop.
I was here in '74, when desegregation started... and they bussing in white kids, and bussing out little black kids like you.
Yeah, I remember that.
And then I was here in '77... when Walter Payton came in here... the day after he had rushed 275 yards against Minnesota.
And I lined him up in this chair... and I got the picture to prove it.
Eddie, how do we know that's really Payton?
That's Walter.
That's him.
The signature says "Sweetness" right there!
What more do you want?
I don't know, a real picture?
That's "Sweetness" all right.
What did you do?
I got a patch in my head!
Patch the little boy's head up.
I told you to keep still...
- I got a patch on my head!
Shame, you put a patch on the boy's head.
Got him looking like 101 dalmatians.
You heard of that movie?
Looks like a Dalmatian, that's 102!
Mind your business.
I didn't move my head!
It's not my fault!
Man, why do I gotta...
You look good.
- Take care of the thing.
Quit talking, more cut.
Wait till my mom gets here.
I've got it now.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Got that little boy looking like a leopard.
He needs little spots all around. Look at him!
Don't ignore me.
Don't ignore me like that.
Turn their heads....
How's everybody doing?
My bad.
Clean you up or something?
How you doing, Mr. Wallace?
- How you doing?
Good to see you, thanks for coming.
- Yes, indeed.
Wanna go out back and talk?
- Yeah.
All right.
Eddie.
- Nigger.
Calvin, I'm glad you called me back.
I was beginning to think you don't like Lester.
Heard you just bought Big CarI's Auto Shop. Left everything the same.
I was hoping you'd do the same thing here.
I told you, I'm a man of my word.
You know, Calvin... if you can't make the payments... you're gonna lose the shop... and have nothing.
Or, if you sell it to me... you make sure that the sign outside always says "barbershop."
I can live with that.
If you take this money, that's as good as a contract.
I wouldn't want to have any misappropriations going on up in here.
Yeah, me neither.
You know, I made your father the same offer... but he turned it down.
But you're a better businessman.
You got vision.
$20,000, that's your buyout.
I'll manage bank payments, as discussed.
And I'll get the paperwork to you next week.
Okay.
You're sure you're gonna keep the barbershop open, right?
I'm a businessman, and a barbershop ain't exactly a cash cow.
So I'll turn it into a gentlemen's club.
Wait a minute.
That's not what we discussed, Mr. Wallace.
You told me that the sign outside would always say "barbershop."
It will.
It's gonna be called "The Barbershop." I'll keep that same theme going.
The girls dressed like little barbers.
You can come in, and they'll give you a trim.
And you can get some trim.
Hold it, Mr. Wallace.
Mr. Wallace!
You have a nice day.
I just don't understand why someone would drive into the store like that.
Now, see, I told Sitting Bull across the street over there... not to put no cash machine in his store... 'cause black people don't know how to act.
Who're you telling?
That's why black people can't have nothing.
Apparently, neither can Indian folks.
Give me! Move!
Samir is not Indian, okay?
He's Pakistani.
He's from Pakistan.
All I know is, he can pack and stand his ass on that corner all he want to.
But if Geronimo keeps on, somebody's liable to bust a cap in his ass, right?
Right, Eddie, he's gonna get it!
- He's gonna pah-yow!
Samir is not Native American, okay?
He's not Arab, he's not Mexican, he's not Eskimo.
He is from Pakistan.
Pakistan, yakistan, you-back-istan.
I don't care where he's from.
He ain't from here, I know that.
He ain't gonna win in the South Side, either.
Damn, speaking of Pakistan....
That's all right!
Boy, what's wrong with you?
He cut a patch in the back of my head.
I'm sorry, ma'am, it wasn't my fault.
He kept moving, so...
I did not, I did not keep moving.
Bless her.
You know you kept moving.
- What're you talking about?
It don't look that bad.
- Yes, it does.
Think of it as a new style.
Before you know it, everybody'll be walking around with a patch in their head.
Why would people walk around with a patch in their head?
So, that makes it free, right?
Ain't that right?
Right?
Okay.
Come on.
Jimmy will never touch your head again, I promise.
Thank you.
Damn!
Hey, babe, me and her, mostly me, I tell you!
Come on, man, this thing heavy, dog.
I'll take it.
Damn, my phone's ringing.
J.D.
- What?
Would you please back up?
My bad.
Thank you.
I couldn't breathe.
- Come on, man, get in there.
Open the door.
Is that that punk Jay?
My foot! - Jay!
You all right?
Jay!
Come here, you punk!
I'm gonna get your black ass.
Billy!
Get up!
Come here!
Billy!
What the hell are you doing, man?
Man, you just let him get away.
He owes me $5 from a crap game.
I ain't paying your ass nothing!
What?
- Billy!
Bring your ass back over here!
- Lucky I ain't got my Jordans on!
Come on, Billy, bring your ass back over here.
$5!
You gonna cause a scene in public for $5?
Man, he owes me money.
We've got $50,000 back at the motel.
You're gonna cause a scene for $5?
$5?
It ain't even about the money.
It's the principle.
What?
- That's right, the principle.
He's supposed to pay.
This is Chi-Town's finest, and I ain't going out like no sucker.
You ain't going out like no sucker?
- No.
You know what, player?
We're gonna get caught.
And you wanna know why?
- Why?
There's a stupid nigger in every bunch, who messes up everybody.
You know what?
You that dumb nigger.
You know what? I tell you this.
If he owed you money, you'd be chasing him, too.
I would've whupped him last week.
- Why you think I was chasing him? What....
Shit!
What?
Keep it moving.
Ain't nothing to see here.
Come on, man.
I lost my head.
But you understand, it wasn't just money.
- $5, player?
I'm telling you, they got about $15,000 or $20,000 in that ATM.
Those machines are worth more than the money in them.
There may be a reward.
- For an ATM machine?
I wish the money in it was mine.
I'd use that money, I'd take my girl out to a real nice dinner, like Red Lobster.
See, now that's upscale.
Red Lobster is the IHOP of shellfish.
That is not upscale.
I don't hate cheese toast just 'cause I'm eating... scampis and shrimps and scallops and shit.
You are truly ignorant.
You don't know what a scallop is.
It ain't even a shellfish.
Did you know you get on my nerves?
Pampers if you're too late.
- What's with the dogs?
Get them dogs out of here.
- You like dogs.
Don't make me smack you.
- I told you once.
Y'all need some dogs I got this one, if you buy this one... you get this one half off.
- Don't come back, man.
Going home.
I'm never coming in this shop again.
I work for me.
Calvin, what that boy name?
I've told you four times, that's Ricky.
Hold still.
What?
- What do you think you doing?
I'm just trying to get him clean like them Gillette commercials.
That's the problem with y'all today.
Y'all don't know nothing.
Sit up there, just watch too much TV and listen to that Jigga Ray... and all them folk up in there, hippity-hoppity nonsense... and don't know nothing.
Let me.
Sir, you mind?
Rick, get that off there, and lean him back.
Roots, get me a hot towel.
Dinka, Eddie.
Dinka.
These young boys don't know nothing.
Let me get you lathered up here.
Put that towel on his face.
Get your foam nice and lathery.
Y'all come over here and learn something.
You finish that up.
Put that on there.
Put that on the side over there.
See, in my day, a barber was more than just somebody... who sit around in a FUBU shirt with his drawers hanging all out.
In my day, a barber was a counselor.
He was a fashion expert.
A style coach.
Pimp.
Just general, all-around hustler.
But the problem with y'all cats today... is that... you got no skill.
No sense of history.
And then, with a straight face... got the nerve to want to be somebody.
Want somebody to respect you.
But it takes respect to get respect.
Understand?
See, I'm old.
But, Lord willing...
I'd be spared the sight of seeing everything that we worked for... flushed down the drain... by someone who don't know no better... or care.
Calvin.
- Hey, baby.
Can we talk in the back?
That's coming right on off there.
See, that's smooth.
When he get through, his face gonna be real smooth, like Gary Coleman.
Calvin, baby, what's going on?
What you mean?
Janelle called me and said that she saw Lester Wallace in here.
Why Janelle won't stay out my business?
God.
When did you start doing business with a loan shark like him?
Lester Wallace is not a loan shark.
- Really?
He's just a businessman from the street.
Okay, but wait.
Why was he here?
To get a haircut.
Calvin, Lester Wallace wears a hairpiece.
He had to get that faded a little bit.
So, I just.... No?
All right.
Come here.
Let me show you something.
I'll show you something that's gonna make you much happier.
Check it out.
What did you do?
I sold the barbershop.
You sold your father's barbershop to Lester Wallace?
Don't, "shh" me.
We're trying to get our recording studio started.
Recording studio? Have you forgotten?
You almost electrocuted yourself this morning.
What matters is, I made this move for us. This is for us.
Us?
- Yes.
Tell me something. Why is it you make all these spontaneous decisions... and then we got to get us out of it?
Baby.... I had to do something to get the monkey off our back. That's what I did.
But, listen.
Your grandfather opened this shop.
He handed it down to your father, who left it to you.
And all he did was give away free haircuts.
Now they want freebies.
He let all those barbers in there use their station whenever they wanted to... pay rent whenever they wanted to, and we're in debt because of that.
It's because of him.
I'm not gonna work my ass off for that.
Dinka.
What're they saying?
Something about a monkey coming back. But his ass has too much pressure.
You deserve more than this.
I'm trying to give you the world.
You know what? I don't need the world.
I don't need Oprah's house.
It's not Oprah's house.
It's Stedman's guesthouse... and it's a five-bedroom, four-and-a-half bath... with a Jacuzzi, pool...
This shop had very little debt until... you started spending all the money on those get-rich-quick schemes.
It's my fault?
Let me hear you say it.
It's my fault?
Well, yeah, it's your fault.
How is it my fault, and I'm just trying to better myself?
Wait a minute, I see what this is about.
This is about you.
Okay.
- No.
You know what? I mean, think about it.
How could you sell this place?
I met you here.
My father used to come here every Saturday.
He loved this place.
You used to love it, too.
What happened?
This is a little too much for me right now.
You gonna mess around and send me into premature labor.
I can't believe you sold your father's shop.
- Jennifer....
Still couldn't hear nothing.
Can you help me with this shoe?
From the heel, dog. Let the toe go.
Pull this sock off for me, too.
- Are these socks clean?
They're my mama's socks, man.
You know we wear the same size shoe?
Damn. You need a Band-Aid, man.
I'm going to go get that for you.
Oh, no. Hey.
I'll go get the Band-Aid.
'Cause you can't seem to do nothing right.
You just stay here, work on the ATM.
Damn. I mean, man, your foot's Jacked up.
It isn't nothing but some dead skin.
All I need is some cocoa butter.
I can get that.
Excuse me, player.
Excuse me, dog.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, God!
Okay, man, are we straight or what?
Next.
- Hold on, man.
$20, man.
- All right.
Here's a little something extra for Johnnie's shoe fund.
Take care.
Hold on, player.
- Wait!
Hey, hook me up, Cal.
See, I was next.
- No, I was here earlier.
You got any money?
-Man, I got your money--
-See, I got money too.
I'll do you next.
Sit over there, fish.
I'll do you next.
Either that or go see Eddie.
I'm busy.
- I don't want to see Eddie.
That's right.
Come on.
Take care.
You know I got stuff to do, man.
Get these nose hairs for me.
Nose hairs?
You ain't got my money, I'm going to get them ass hairs for you.
I hear that Evander Holyfield gonna put a Red Lobster in a church.
How is he gonna call himself a man of God?
You know what? You're right.
When he down there in Georgia, slinging his thing through half the state.
I bet that you all didn't even know Jesus wasn't a Christian.
He was a Jew.
Hey, Jimmy.
- Yo.
Why you always throwing out random trivia, like you know everything?
I don't think I know everything, I'm saying that being educated... guarantees I won't spend my life behind bars.
That's what this is about?
Me being in the pen?
I'm just saying...
- Who you talking about?
I'm just saying, being educated means you have opportunities.
And the rest of us are doing what?
Biding our time?
Can you guys stop arguing for once?
You're like a bunch of little kids. Back and forth.
I'm getting a headache.
That's cool. I'm not gonna get worked up.
This isn't the end of the line for Jimmy James.
Well, leave.
You could do a lot worse than being a barber.
And a lot better.
And don't hate me 'cause I'm trying to make something of myself.
Black Picasso of the ghetto!
- Barber's a respectable occupation.
I'll have my own mural, my own shop.
I might even take over this shop if Calvin don't give it to his son.
Let me tell you something.
You will never own a black barbershop.
I will if I want to.
- If Tony Roma can make ribs better... than black people, Isaac can own a black barbershop.
Ribs better than black people?
You want some good ribs?
You should go over to CK on 75th.
Tony Roma boils his ribs.
That is not authentic.
No.
Tony Roma's is delicious.
You know, I don't see white or black.
I just see red sauce on everything.
Well, you're new here.
He don't boil his ribs.
- I like them.
Know what? Jimmy got a point.
Because nobody in here want to be a barber... for the rest of their life.
Thank you.
That's all I'm saying.
I like cutting hair.
Wait a minute. A barber is a craftsman.
I mean, it's respectable.
And I must admit I like it.
So I guess I agree with Terri.
You agree with everything Terri say.
Watch it, Jimmy.
- You a hater.
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Hey, Lamar.
Run, nigger.
Look at him go.
Be right back.
Hey, Lamar.
Don't bring your skinny ass back.
See that?
That's why you can't have no business in the ghetto.
You must not know me.
Well, I'm Chi-Town's finest.
I'll whup into you like that, boy.
Now, I'm gonna have to poke you.
Oh, I think I got it.
Just give us the money.
What's my mama's code?
Thank you, cutie.
You're welcome, my beautiful black sister.
What's up, little man?
I got an announcement to make.
I bought some more apple juice.
And I want nobody in here to drink it.
Have some respect and decency for other people's stuff.
What you looking at me for?
- Because I know you drank it.
Did you see me drink it?
-I don't care.
I'm being real nice right now.
Don't touch my apple juice, or there will be repercussions.
You know what? Repercussion, my nuts.
- Grow some.
You hear that?
Barbershop.
Terri, it's Kevin.
I'm not here.
What?
- I'm not here.
I know you heard that.
All right.
Let's kill all this applause, now, because we all know... that she's gonna go right back to him just like she always do.
Don't make me run these clippers up your ass.
Might need some help with that.
- She told you.
Terri, you all right?
I should thank you.
For what?
This morning, I made such a spectacle of myself.
But your words were kind.
I believe they were, "Stay strong, brother."
Something like that.
How much I owe you for this?
For one brief, embarrassing moment, I chose to give up.
But your words were just the reminder I needed.
Perhaps insignificant to you... but sometimes I think... we are unaware of how the little things for us can be so huge for others.
Hey, honeybun.
Hey, boo.
- This is just too much.
Hi.
It's okay.
Take your time.
Oh, my boo.
Anyway, I do find it amusing that the people... who stole my ATM will not get any money out of it.
Oh, yeah.
You can't break into those things.
'Cause there is no money in it.
It is brand new.
It had not even been loaded yet.
There's no money in it?
That's a trip. - Yes.
How much I owe you for this? - No.
Put your money away.
You take this.
This is for you.
Thanks, man.
So, what you gonna do?
I rebuild.
I fix the store, and I stay right here.
The fight must go on.
Either that, or I go back to India.
India?
I thought you were from Pakistan.
Heavens, no.
Who would tell you such a thing?
Jimmy.
No, India. PunJab State.
Northwest side, close to Pakistan, though.
Thanks, man, I appreciate this.
Your words were payment enough.
What else can I have...
- No, that's all you get.
What about those...
- No.
Thanks for the juice, man. - You're welcome.
I'll see you soon.
Fellows, what's up?
Got the shoes.
Hey, Checkers.
- You got them?
You got the shoes.
I'll show you how to play.
I'll show you how to play some hardball!
Y'all, look at this lady.
Give it up!
- Now you're talking!
Come over here.
You got to see this.
You're missing it!
Somebody out there doing somebody's car?
Damn!
She wanna be real, crack that windshield!
That's what I'd do!
I'll get you good!
Man, what kind of car is it?
- Toyota Camry.
Wait, that's a good car.
I got one of them. I just bought one.
Sick!
What color is it?
Silver.
Pimp!
Player!
That's a good color.
It got a chrome rocker panel?
That's my car!
What the hell you doing?
That's my car!
Stop hitting on my car!
This is Malcolm Brown's car.
Put the bat down!
I don't know Bobby Brown!
Leave my car alone!
Stop hitting my car!
Stop it!
Put the bat down!
This ain't Malcolm Brown car?
- This ain't no Malcolm Brown.
I just bought it!
It look like Malcolm Brown car.
Lady, I don't care what it look like!
It's my car.
Wait a minute. This ain't Malcolm's car?
Fuck!
Who the hell is Malcolm Brown?
Damn.
Well, my bad.
Your what?
What you say?
Your bad?
I hope I never make a woman that angry.
Hey, Ricky.
What's up?
I'm feeling to go get some fish.
So, Ricky... what advice can you offer a guy like me on the art of wooing women?
On what?
You know, getting the hookup... the digits, the skins, ill nana, snappy nappy, oochie wallie?
Yo, just be yourself.
I'm big-boned, Rick, hefty, rotund.
There's too much of myself to go around.
Hold it. There's plenty of fat brothers pulling good ass.
Look at Biggie, Heavy D.
They were world-famous rappers.
I, on the other hand, am an overweight barber from West Africa... with a fondness for poetry.
Attitude will put you on.
Confidence.
Okay.
She got to know that, at a moment's notice, you know, you will not hesitate... to put the pimp hand down on Jesus himself... if he ever made the mistake of disrespecting her.
How you think Captain Kirk got all that booty?
Yes!
Thank you, brother!
Put me down.
Hey, Calvin.
- What's up man?
Got them shoes!
I was just looking at these!
How are you doing, Mr. Wallace?
This is Calvin.
You think it'd be all right if I come through there and talk to you?
First thing I'm gonna do, get a tattoo.
Say, "Thug Nasty, Nasty Thug."
Matter of fact, I'm going to get myself a Bentley with some 20s on it.
That's what I'm going to do.
Thanks to you.
I'm going to get some 25s.
And you the reason why.
That's what I'm going to do.
You wanna act like you ain't giving it up, but I'm going to get that, just like I got you.
And you better have my money.
Oh, no!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Damn!
Open this door!
Who is it?
- It's the manager!
Open this door!
What's going on up in there?
- Nothing.
What you mean, nothing?
What the hell is that smell?
I got diarrhea.
- Diarrhea?
If you done messed up...
How come you up here like you the police?
If you done messed up this room...
- Ain't nobody messed up your room.
You better open up this door!
Diarrhea, my ass.
I ain't got to worry about you.
Why are your keys Jingling out there?
Come in this room and see what happens.
I'm calling the cops!
Call the cops, then.
- You better...
See how you like it when the cops come.
Wait a minute.
I take that back!
Don't do that.
Come back!
Damn!
I'm calling the cops on you two!
What the hell?
Put it down.
Watch your toes.
All right, this is what we going to do.
I'm going to take this to my grandmama's house.
And I want you to see what the word on the street is.
Just hang out at the barbershop.
You sure you can handle that?
Do I have to draw you a picture?
- No.
But can I go change my drawers first?
Because they sticking to me.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
But when you're at the barbershop, you keep your mouth shut.
I want you to be inconspicuous.
The Panthers, you got to give it up to them...
Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson... and you got to give it up to Rosa Parks, period.
Because they was deep, and they was on the front line in the '60s.
Who the hell is Rosa Parks?
- Who's Rosa Parks?
She's only the founder of the modern civil rights movement.
'Cause she sat her ass down on the bus?
- Come on, you know who she is.
Man, she was tired.
That's what you do when you tired.
You sit your ass down.
I sat on a bus and got thrown in Jail, and ain't hear from nobody in a whole week.
Laptops, computers, ceiling cleaners.
I done told you twice.
- Come on.
You know what? He need to hear this.
You sit down.
You sit down.
You need to hear this, too.
Sit down, Rayford.
I probably wouldn't say this in front of white folk.
But in front of y'all, I'll speak my mind.
Rosa Parks ain't do nothing... but sit her black ass down.
No, Eddie, you're wrong.
Hold on, now, Seinfeld.
You might learn something now.
I'm gonna give her just due for what she did.
Her act led to the movement and everything... but she damn sure ain't special.
It was a whole lot of black folk sat down on buses... and they got thrown in Jail, and they did it way before Rosa did!
Only difference between them and her... is that she was a secretary at the NAACCP... and she know Martin Luther King, and they got a lot of publicity.
To me it sound like you got a little haterism in your game.
Like hell! This ain't no hateration, or no holleration in this dancery, okay?
What I'm saying is, is that black people need to stop lying.
There's three things that black people need to tell the truth about.
One, Rodney King should have got his ass beat... for driving drunk and being pulled over in a Hyundai.
Two, O.J. did it.
O.J. did it?
Oh, man!
And three, Rosa Parks ain't do nothing but sit her black ass down.
That's right!
I said it!
I'm going to back you up on that, 'cause he was on the bus back in the day.
And he on the bus now.
Not only is what you're saying not true... it's wrong and disrespectful for you to discuss Rosa Parks in that way.
Wait.
Hold on here.
Is this a barbershop?
- Yes, it is.
I mean, if we can't talk straight in a barbershop... then where can we talk straight?
Nowhere else.
You know, this ain't nothing but healthy conversation.
That's all.
Tearing Rosa Parks down?
There ain't nobody exempt in a barbershop!
You know that.
You can talk about whoever and whatever, whenever you want to in a barbershop.
You know you wrong, keep on walking.
You're walking by yourself.
I ain't with you.
I'll tell you one thing.
You better not never let Jesse Jackson hear you talking like that.
Man, fuck Jesse Jackson!
Jesse, Randy, Tito, Freddie, Action, I'll take them all on!
That's what I got to say!
Man, I love this place.
To make that paper, you see what I'm saying?
Man, you got to have it with you.
What's up, man?
Where you going?
You can't just walk past me like you don't see me.
I'm talking to you, dog!
You can't just walk past me like that.
What, you Magic Juan or something?
Is Mr. Wallace in there?
- He here.
I lead.
You follow.
Okay, lead.
Two steps, motherfucker, two steps.
You know, Calvin... I have never come across anybody just wanting to give me my money back.
The whole thing, frankly... vexes me, to be honest.
I swear to God, I'm not trying to vex you.
I don't even know what that mean.
All I'm saying is, I done had a change of heart.
I had all day to think about it.
If I'm going to lose my shop, I just don't want to lose it this way.
Which way is that?
My money ain't good enough for you?
I'm just some old street doo-doo, is that it?
You walk your black ass into some white man's bank... and you'll find out that I'm the only friend you got.
On the subject of the money I gave you this morning... the money is yours, the shop is mine.
But I'd be willing to call off the whole deal... if you were to get me my money by, say... 7:00.
No problem.
I could do better than that.
Give it to you right now.
$40,000.
But you only gave me $20,000.
That's double.
You expect me to pay you double by 7:00?
Come on, Mr. Wallace.
Get out of my office.
Here go your money back.
I'm putting it right here on the table for you.
I'm sorry about any misunderstanding, or... if I led you on in any kind of way, I'm sorry... but I can't sell my shop to you.
You forgot something.
- That's not mine.
What you mean?
- I don't want it.
You keep it.
You going to take this money.
How you gonna renege?
You keep it!
No, man, you keep it!
You forgot something!
Take this money!
- I don't want it!
Do I look like Barry Sanders?
Do I look like Lawrence Taylor?
I don't want it!
- Shut up!
I got a Job to do!
And you ain't allowing me to do it.
Come on.
Hold on.
Damn!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Got me running all over the goddamn place.
This money's yours.
You hear me?
Yeah.
My grandmama home.
Girl, you got a great future behind you.
Oh, shit!
What the fuck?
What the hell am I gonna do?
6-0-5.... 613, we've got a 10-1 at 81st and Corrigan.
That's us, man.
Come on, we got to go.
Forget about the cash.
You got to buy lunch.
I don't have any money.
Let's go.
The machine broke, y'all!
I said, the machine broke!
Wait, I'm sorry I messed up your flowers and everything.
They were real pretty.
You talking to me?
You the only one standing here, right?
Yes, this is true.
And the card... what it said, it was pretty, too.
You wrote that yourself?
No.
Actually, that's a love poem... by a man named Pablo Neruda.
He knows what to say.
Got me feeling all gentle.
So, Terri, I know you have a boyfriend and everything.
But, you know... I was wondering... maybe we could, you...
- Kevin.
Brother K.
Hey, baby.
Excuse me, brother.
These are for you.
We need to talk.
Hold on a second, baby.
Super-Size-Me Mandela, you wanna get up off my neck?
Hold on a second, baby.
What, you don't understand English?
Stop.
Be gone, Mandingo.
- Kevin.
I'm talking to my lady.
Can you believe Shaka-Zulu?
- Listen!
I need to say something.
All right, I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say, but...
I love you.
- Bullshit.
You know that.
Everybody up in here knows this.
So look, why don't we just go outside... talk about this?
Come on.
No.
I can't do this no more.
- Do what?
This. Us.
This game.
I ain't playing games, baby.
Let's just move on.
So, what, you just gonna break up with me?
You're breaking up with me?
I mean, come on, baby.
Look at you.
You ain't even all that fine.
You just average.
I didn't mind 'cause you was good in bed.
You do that thing.
But I can find better.
I didn't mean that.
See, I want you.
You are... sorry.
You're so sorry.
Leave.
Get out.
Don't put your finger in my...
- Leave.
I do want... - Out!
Clown!
Gonna get my blade.
Cut me somebody up in here.
That's a safari punch!
Get him on out of here.
I'm gonna call your mom and tell her what happened!
Dinka, boma ye!
Fool almost messed up my part.
Damn!
Ray-Ray?
- It's me.
They said you was working in the street.
I didn't know you was cleaning them!
What you got? - Nothing.
Do you and nothing need a ride? - Yeah.
Bring that nothing on.
Come on.
Can you see all right?
I'll watch out on this side.
Just right around the corner.
Thanks.
- Okay, you take care, now.
Good to have you here in Chicago.
Welcome to the Bulls.
Michael who?
See you on Sports Center.
- See y'all soon.
If he can't be the best, he can go to hell, too.
They're going be good.
What the hell is you looking at?
I'm curious, man.
I've been getting my hair cut here since I was a kid.
And I ain't never seen nobody in your chair.
I got plenty of customers.
You just come on the wrong day.
That's Monday to Saturday, except Sunday, when we're closed.
Don't worry, Booker T.
You think you could hook me up like Iverson?
'Cause that's my dog.
Fade away, boo-yah!
What you laughing at?
- Don't hate on me 'cause you a sellout.
I didn't hear that.
- You heard me, "Bourgie" Banton.
You got the black girlfriend, the ride, and I'm a sell-out?
You're nothing but a minstrel show turned on its ear.
Al Jolson in a FUBU hat.
Blackface for the new millennium.
You think you could hook me up with your black girlfriend, white girlfriends...
With your higher education, how come you only talk about me?
'Cause you don't belong here.
The white barbershop is uptown.
You know what I think?
You wish you were me.
You wish you had my fly-ass girlfriend and my pimped-out ride.
Man, you even wish you had my clothes, my style, my walk.
Why you think my fly-ass girl ain't with you?
'Cause your little bitch ass can't compete.
I got news for you, white boy.
You're not black.
I'm blacker than you, and in your best day, you could never be me.
-You gonna take that?
-Turn it up like this.
Come on!
What you got on me?
Come on, what you gonna give me for it?
Man, that piece of Junk barely run.
It run.
It's the hottest thing on the street.
All the youngsters asking me about it.
Cutlass Sierra?
All it need is a little paint and a tune-up, 'cause it backfires just about that much.
A little?
Man, every time you go home, I think I'm in a drive-by.
I can't put that on my lot, man.
I got a reputation to think about.
Understand?
No, I don't understand.
Lunch?
Thanks.
I got that plate number.
Also, there were a bunch of people lined up at an ATM outside Poppy's Liquor Mart.
So?
It just showed up, and then it was gone.
Let's go.
Come on.
I heard, on BET, we supposed to make some money.
Black people supposed to be getting some money called reparations.
Everybody here would love to get a handout.
If they handing it out, I won't turn down nothing but my collar.
Not everybody think reparations is a good idea, dog.
It's stupid.
I'm surprised to hear that.
I figured you'd make a case for how slavery got y'all oppressed... how the white man got his foot on your neck.
Giving out money wouldn't do nothing.
Look at Hammer.
That boy ain't doing nothing but infomercials for bad credit.
Slavery, it ruined my whole life.
I don't know what y'all say, I ain't taking reparations.
As a black man, I got my pride and my dignity.
That's bull. You know why?
Because you got bills.
Your brothers ain't letting no money get by.
Next, you'll talk about how Jews got money...
Jews didn't get money, the Holocaust survivors got the money.
Look, we had welfare and affirmative action.
Is that not respirations?
Is that respirations?
That is respiration.
Shit!
Well I think every black person should at least get $100,000.
What do you think that's gonna do?
That won't do nothing but make Cadillac number-one dealership in the country.
Everywhere you look, there's opportunity. You know what I mean?
I had this opportunity to get this Job last month.
This crack-ass cracker going to tell me I need a diploma.
Now, right there, that's racism, that's classism, that's eroticism.
Man, come on, I'm talking 'bout "isms" up and...
We don't need reparations. All right?
We need restraint.
Restraint?
- Restraint.
Some discipline.
- Whatever.
Don't go out and buy a Range Rover when you living with your mama.
And pay your mama some rent.
And can we please try and teach our kids something other than a Chronic album?
And, please, black people, be on time... for something other than "free before 11:00" at the club.
Drink to that, baby.
You know what? That was a passionate and surprisingly well-articulated argument.
You mocking me?
- Not at all, sir.
I'm actually.... I applaud your virtuosity.
You know what, schoolboy?
For your information... a scallop is a shellfish.
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
No, I'm afraid it is.
Because it's a mollusk.
Before it comes to your dinner plate... it got two shells wrapped around it, just like a clam.
Stupid.
College boy.
Hey, Grandma.
It's me, J.D.
Thelma's son.
Your grandson!
J.D.
Grandma.
Nigga never come to see me.
Grandma, did you say something?
- Grandma don't see or hear too good. Okay.
- You want something to eat, baby?
No, that's okay, Grandma.
I'm going be out back at the tool shed.
All right.
I'll see you in.
Oh, yeah.
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Get this phone from me, two for one.
- The last one didn't work.
Listen to me, baby, check it out.
- Ray! What you doing?
Selling my phones, man.
How many times I told you not to come in here soliciting?
Come on, man, Cal, I'm just selling my phones, man.
What's wrong with you?
Are you retarded?
- What's up man?
Are you stupid, simple or slow? Which one?
None of that.
You come back in here. I'm going to call the police.
Hold up.
What you mean, call the police?
How you going do that to me? I been coming here for years.
Everything you needed I got for you.
When the air conditioner broke, who brought the Freon? Me.
What about when Eddie had tax problems?
I got him a new social.
Not you.
Me.
I'm part of this shop, too, man.
I don't want to hear that.
- What's up, man?
Get out of here, man.
- You ain't right, Calvin, you ain't right, man.
I don't want him back in the shop no more.
Don't buy nothing from him.
What was that thing all about in there?
You know that boy don't want no trouble.
He ain't going to cause no problem around here.
I messed up, Eddie.
I messed up bad.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
What did you do?
Can't get it up?
The Viagra ain't working for you?
I lost the shop.
I actually sold it to Lester Wallace.
I just realized today that this was something worth saving.
Worth saving?
This ain't no goddamn school of the blind, Calvin.
This is the barbershop!
The place where a black man means something!
Cornerstone of neighborhood!
Our own country club!
I mean, can't you see that?
You know... that's the problem with your whole generation.
You know, you all, you don't believe in nothing.
But your father, he believed in something, Cal.
He believed and understood... that something as simple as a little haircut... could change the way a man felt on the inside.
My father died broke... and frustrated... trying to help everybody in this damn neighborhood.
Look!
Your daddy may not have had a whole lot of money... but he was rich... 'cause he invested in people.
Well, what you think?
You think I'm the only one he gave a Job to?
No!
That man opened up the doors... to anybody and any knucklehead round here in the city of Chicago... that wanted to come down here and make something out they self.
Gave them the opportunity to be somebody!
A licensed, professional barber.
Now, me, myself personally... I wouldn't have gave half these bail-Jumpers the opportunity.
But it just hard enough, you sitting there trying to cut some head... and gotta worry 'bout this fool trying to shank you.
But let me tell you something.
At the end of the day....
At the end of the day, I was glad I was here.
And now you.
They know?
No.
Well, you gonna have to tell them.
Don't look at me.
Yo, Cal.
You got some nerve bringing your ass back around here.
I got the Job.
Now I can put my little girl in real day care.
My sister-in-law was keeping her.
She's a crackhead and I can't have that.
Thanks, Cal.
Keep the change.
Yo, Lamar.
No charge.
- No, no.
No, Calvin, you keep that, man.
I know you need it.
Congratulations on your new Job, man.
Looking good for a change.
Take it easy.
- Thanks, Cal.
Good night.
Come on.
Your drop.
I'm only saying he's a cripple.
He's not crippled.
He's cute.
Tell his mama to set me up.
Hey, yo, listen up, everybody. What?
- All right.
Hold on, listen.
Yo, Fred.
Listen up.
I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, that... I appreciate everybody in here.
We appreciate you having us, Calvin.
- I'm serious.
Now hold up, I'm serious.
- Give us a raise now.
I appreciate everything you guys do for the shop.
I know some of the customers don't leave tips like they supposed to.
And if I had the money, I'd tip you guys myself.
Big C, what's wrong, dude?
We're gonna be closing up the shop today.
What?
- Why, Calvin?
You mean closing early?
- What you mean by "today"?
We only got about a hour.
You guys are not hearing me.
When I took this shop over two years ago, I didn't know what I had.
I was young.
I didn't know.
Hold tight, man.
What you trying to say?
Eddie, what you doing, man?
What's going on?
I sold the shop.
You what?
You sold the shop?
- You don't own the shop no more?
I don't understand.
- He said he sold the shop, Dinka.
This is your shop, man.
Your family built this shop.
Can't nobody run this shop like you, boy.
- For real, man.
Why you ain't tell us?
Who are we gonna be working for?
Like I was saying, that... when I close the shop tonight... it's closing for good.
Calvin, please.
Calvin, don't do this.
Eddie, can I talk to you, man? Eddie?
Hey, Eddie!
I still don't understand.
Go home! Just go home.
It's over.
I didn't mean that, man.
Just pack up.
No warning? That's it?
Let's just be out, man.
Let's just be out.
- That's foul, Joe.
I'm outta here.
Cal, you could have told us.
I don't believe this.
- Why?
Oh, no! - Police!
Nobody move!
Get him up and get him out.
Hold on, man!
Wait a minute! Shut up!
You just stay right there!
What did he do?
Let's go. - Hey, Rick!
I ain't do nothing!
Hey, that ain't even necessary right there!
Williams, can I talk to you?
That shit ain't necessary!
Don't worry, I'll get back at you.
Let me get him squared away. Rick!
Call me soon as they let you use a phone.
Hey, what's up, J.D.?
Where the hell you been, man?
At the barbershop.
- All day?
You got a cut. - Yeah.
Yeah, man, I wanted to get braided, but you know Terri, she be tripping.
Right, who lined you up?
- It was Jimmy who did....
Come on, man!
What you doing?
Braiding your hair, sucker!
Stop playing. Stop.
You better stop playing.
What you learn at the barbershop?
Man, I learned a lot, man.
- What about the police, man?
Man, they know what's up.
They came up in there, like, 10 deep, man! 20, boom!
"Get up against the wall!"
- Hold up, man, my foot!
Man, I'm tellin' you, it was like SWAT.
You serious?
I wouldn't have made it alive if I hadn't done the shake move... and, you know, I crept up outta there.
Hold on.
Hello?
Hey, I got ask you a question.
- Who this?
Ricky, fat ass, and guess where I'm at.
What's up, dog?
- It's the last place I'm gonna be for life.
What you talking about, player?
I'm talking about that smash-and-grab with that ATM the other night.
The same night you borrowed my truck.
I been calling you all day about the bumper.
Now they got photos of the plate.
And they traced it back to me. A two-time loser.
Ricky, did you just say "two-time loser"?
As in, your third strike?
Yeah.
You're going to Jail for life, player!
And when you do get out, I'm going to be long gone!
Hey, don't drop the soap!
Come on, player.
- What'd he say, man?
What we gonna do?
We going crack this piggy bank and get paid.
Man, let me tell you something.
Just 'cause you go to some fancy college don't make you better than me.
Don't make you better than no one.
I probably won't ever even go to school, but I'm gonna do something with my life.
I'm gonna have me a business.
I'm opening up a shop.
And despite what you may think... I ain't pretending to be someone I saw on TV.
This is who I am.
And whether you like it or not, I'm gonna be like this tomorrow.
All right, man, let's see it.
See what?
You're saying this is who you are.
This is who you'll be, right?
So, prove it.
Hook me up.
All right.
Okay.
That's not bad.
Actually, it's pretty good.
Hey, man, I shouldn't have disrespected you like that, in front of everybody.
Nah, it's cool, man.
I'm actually kind of glad you came to your senses.
Why is that?
- 'Cause I was running outta insults.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thanks, baby.
So, I guess you can invest in that studio now.
Look, Calvin.... I'll support you. You know that.
If it's a studio, fine.
You want to sell used hubcaps, or I don't know... thong underwear, whatever, I'm with you.
Whatever it is you do... make it mean something to you.
And, if it doesn't work out, you know, you can always just go work for my uncle.
You know I can't stand your uncle.
And he can't stand you, but he'll give you a Job as a favor to me.
Where are you going?
- Be right back.
Thanks for bringing my coat.
I didn't do it.
If I thought you did it, I would have never bailed you out.
And I damn sure wouldn't be out here freezing my balls off.
Let's go, man.
Why'd Williams come get you, man?
- My cousin did this to me.
Your cousin?
- J.D. did this to me.
Man, that dude is crazy.
Don't worry about him no more.
People like that always get theirs in the end.
That's right.
You know what?
I'm gonna make sure that he get his.
Don't go there with that.
What you talking about?
I ain't going let a fool roll over me.
You've come too far, did too many things with your life... to let him pull you back.
- I ain't having this conversation.
Just drop me off at 79th.
You know what?
Look.
Here. is that what you want?
That's what I'm talking 'bout.
Yeah, it came out your....
It dropped out your locker.
There you go, man.
Go and throw your life away.
And throw away the bail money, all the money I put up for you.
You know what, Cal?
Just pull over.
Pull over?
Yeah. - Okay.
I'm gonna pull over.
Now you're using your head.
Yeah, whatever, man.
Where we going?
We going to see Lester Wallace.
I'm gonna get my barbershop back.
You wait till I throw out my gun, and tell me we going to see Lester?
Man, we ain't even supposed to be in here.
I told you I used to work here, player.
- That's "used to," J.D.
That means I still know what the hell I'm doing.
All right?
Let me look at this.
Now, that's a fire!
Hell.
- Give me that, let me!
Come on, I got it, dog.
It just went out. I can start it again.
These used to be my tools, dog.
This used to be my station.
You can't even click it right.
- Clap your hands and stomp your feet.
Clap them. Stomp them!
Look at that!
Give it to me.
Let me.
Come on!
Billy!
Give it to me!
Billy, get.
What's your problem?
Why you always gotta push somebody, man?
I'm sick of this!
- You want some of this?
I don't see Lester's car.
Hold tight.
That look like my grandmama truck right there.
Wait a minute.
Don't open the door.
ls it hers?
Hey, yo, Rick, hold up!
Gotta call some backup for us.
Yeah.
J.D.!
No, hey, Rick!
No, man!
Hey! Get back!
Pretty Ricky! What's up baby?
How you like your chicken, Ricky?
Original, or extra crispy?
Bitch!
What are you doing in my shop?
What's going on up in here?
- I'm on your team!
What's going on?
What are you doing in my shop?
I don't know what they doing here.
But you know what I'm here for.
I want my shop back.
You got my money?
No.
- What?
I had to use it help my man Ricky get out of Jail.
But I promise you that I'll get you all your money back.
Wait, let me get this right. You come in here demanding to get back a barbershop that you don't have anymore.
You don't have $40,000 to buy it back... and you don't even have the $20,000 I gave you this morning?
Monk, this man is crazy.
Must be crazy, Mr. Wallace.
I told you, I'll get you your money back, but only $20,000.
If you got a problem with that... I think Chicago PD might have a problem with this ATM machine... sitting in the middle of your floor, 'cause they been lookin' for it all day.
What the hell is this?
Hold tight, Lester, you got bigger problems than that, dog.
Like them stolen car parts over there.
Somebody might mistake this place for a chop shop.
Monk!
Courage?
What you going do?
You gonna have to use that on me, big boy.
It's like I said, I ain't going nowhere.
I got too much to lose.
Can't leave here without it.
Simple and plain.
It's been in my family too long.
Forty years.
I can't just let you take it and turn it into some strip club.
What you wanna do?
Put your hands up!
Put them up!
Calvin?
Are you all right?
Am I all right?
Yeah.
I'm all right.
- You sure?
I'm good.
There go the thugs you want over there.
Simmons, Fred.
- These dudes are fine.
Come on man.
We found that!
My dog.
Don't you ever do that shit again man.
- Are you crazy?
How did we get out of that?
He wasn't going shoot nobody.
He had on leather pants.
Yo, peep this out.
- Yo, what's up?
You get a reward if you turn this in.
Did you know that?
Yo! Detective Williams.
Remember who found this!
Ain't gonna be around here that long.
A couple more years, I'm gonna retire, and I'm gonna move to Arizona.
It's nice down there.
Black folks ought to boycott Arizona... 'cause they didn't recognize King's birthday.
Hold up, now, Fred.
Fred, do not get this fool started on Martin Luther King!
No, Calvin, let me tell it.
Now, Martin Luther King was a hoe!
No, he was a freak. Yeah.
He freaking everything and everybody!
So come King's birthday, I want everybody to take the day off and get your freak on.
Watch your mouth, Eddie!
Look, there are little kids over there. Let me see them report cards.
Calvin, you got that candy?
I want a Now and Later!
No, let me see.
Here you go.
That's you. And that's for you.
Okay?
Watch out.
Hey!
Look what I've got.
- Excuse me!
What?
- Who drank my goddamn apple juice?
Don't "oh" me! Jimmy, I knew it was you! That's why I spit in it.
Hey, boy.
Hey, boy!
Come on, boy.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, fella.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
No more fucking finals!
Hey, don't do it! Don't go to college.
It's a fucking scam. It fucking sucks!
- Bert, got any more smokes?
- No.
Bert: So I'm fat.
So what?
I hope she's not anorexic.
Put her there, sport!
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
- Jesus!
- God damn it, Dennis, no!
No, Dennis, no!
No, don't hit him or anything.
Everybody knows not to sit next to Dennis.
- He'll give you tetanus.
- Maybe you should make a sign.
There's a stream around back, if you want to wash your hand.
I'll get you a towel.
Hey, pal,
do you think it's a smart idea leaving your kid here where he might be a danger to people?
What are you saying exactly?
I'm just saying, if such an incident were to bring about a "lawsuit,"
- you might be held liable.
- Jeff, save it for law school.
Cute kid.
Hey.
What's your name?
Yeah!
If you're interested in really good glasswork, it's cheap, but it's an antique.
Some of those bottles up there are dated before the Civil War.
And over there, I used to have- in that empty space, I used to have some of the prettiest Shirley Temple bottles I've ever seen.
And this woman came in here with the palsy, the poor soul.
She thought they were so cute, and she reached for them and knocked every one down and broke them all to damn pieces.
So I took her in the back and gave her some coke and ammonia.
I thought she was gonna have a spell.
We should get something for your mom to say thanks.
How about some fox piss?
- My mom would love fox piss.
- Oh Lord, don't drop that.
If you do, that's powerful stuff.
All the foxes around would come down here.
You'd have friends you'd never had before.
You all here for a vacation?
Jeff: Yeah, we're renting a cabin for a week.
That's nice.
And if you go in the woods...
- be very careful.
- Why, what's in the woods?
Tommy, get those kids their sandwiches.
They're all wrapped up.
- So, what's the fox urine for?
- That's for foxes.
- What's the rifle for?
- That's for niggers.
Okay, let's see. Let's give you those sandwiches now.
I think we're about ready to get y'all out of here.
- That's $56 even.
- Okay.
Anything I can do for you, friend?
No, I think that's...
Thank you.
You all have a good vacation now.
- You too.
- Come back and see me.
Thanks a lot, man.
You have a nice day.
Jeff: Did that guy just say, "nigger"?
Marcy: Yeah, you don't have to repeat it.
You can call it the "n" word.
Hey.
Boy, you want to give me one good reason why you would steal a Snickers bar.
The nougat?
Sorry, man.
My bad.
All right.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
What?
Moron.
Jeff: What's wrong with you, dude?
Bert: Sorry.
I should burn his fucking store down, the racist fuck!
- Marcy: All right, make a left.
- Jeff: Here?
- Marcy: Make a left.
- Jeff: Where else am I gonna go?
- Jeff: Oh, and then down here...
- Bert: Stop the car!
Stop, stop!
I left my Mott's apple juice back at the store!
- Women: Oh my God.
- Come on!
- Paul: No, we're not going back. - Come on!
Paul: I'm sure this river is in the map, right?
Yes!
Paul: There's no way that this is on the map.
Karen: It is on the map.
Do you want to look?
This map's for Cincinnati.
Karen: Shut up.
Jeff: Fine, fuck it. We'll go this way.
Marcy: Oh my gosh.
Wow.
"Welcome, y'all.
Enjoy your vacation from all of us at Bunyan Mountain Getaways."
Oh my God, Jeff, check it out.
It's so cute- this little room, this little bed... its view is so beautiful.
The view of the shrubs... and the bush and the antlers.
It's gonna be so perfect.
We're here for a week, and there's no one to bother us.
Who's up for a dip?
We're- they're-
Yeah.
Safe sex.
- Eh, Paul?
- Yeah?
Have fun.
It's kind of sweet, you know?
They seem pretty in love.
Bert, what the hell is that?
Huh?
I'm gonna go shoot some squirrels.
Why would you want to kill squirrels?
- 'Cause they're gay.
- Don't be a fucking retard.
Kidding.
I don't care if they're gay or straight.
- I'll kill them either way.
- Will you be careful with that?
Would you relax, man?
It's a fucking BB gun. Relax.
Sorry.
So, Karen... how long have we known each other?
Seventh grade, right?
Yeah.
I was thinking, we've known each other for so long, and even though we- Karen: That's hot!
And, even though we've always been good friends, we never actually-
I've always thought you were really cool.
Hey, race you to the raft.
¢Ü La la la la la la la la la ¢Ü
¢Ü La la la la la la la la la la la... ¢Ü
Fuck!
Jeff: Oh my God!
¢Ü La la la la la la la la la la la... ¢Ü
Oh, feels fucking great!
- You like that?
- Yeah!
Jeff: I'm sorry.
Oh yeah!
So you know Ken Webb?
Yeah.
Short, greasy Ken.
The guy with the CDs, right?
Yeah.
He tried to kiss me.
- He did?
- Yeah.
Two days ago.
This guy I've known for 12 years, he's a family friend.
He puts his hands on my face, full-on tongue!
It was so gross!
Why, was it gross because you've known him for so long or... 'cause he's gross?
No, it was definitely him.
I don't know. When you've known someone a long time, you just want to kiss them just to see if they're a good kisser.
There's nothing wrong with that, right?
No.
- Where are you going?
- What's it look like?
- I thought we were kissing.
- Yeah, we were.
So- so what, you like me now? Is this like a date?
Don't be gay.
Come back, Mr. Woodchuck.
I'm gonna get you now.
Oh shit.
Oh fuck.
I'm sorry, man.
What?
- Why did you shoot me?
- I thought you were something else.
I didn't- fuck!
- Are you all right?
- I'm s- sick.
- I need help.
- Oh man.
I'll get you some help, all right?
I'll be right back.
I got a car.
Oh fuck.
Oh please, help me.
- Fuck.
- I'm sick. I need water.
Just lay down.
Don't move, man.
- Water.
- I'll get you water.
Just stay- don't come near me, okay?
Is that your is that your cabin?
Just stay there!
Please, stay there.
Don't make me fucking shoot you, man.
Just stay the fuck back, please!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
What the fuck, man?
Where were you?
You gonna burn the whole fucking place down?
What are you, Smoky the Clown now?
Don't you mean, Smoky the Bear?
Whatever.
This is horseshit, man.
- It's a fireplace.
- How old are you?
Can't you be responsible for anything?
We can't leave you alone for five minutes without you destroying something!
What were you shooting at?
I heard a squirrel.
I was just looking for a squirrel.
- A squirrel?
- Yeah.
- Fucking idiot.
- Jeff: To stick up his ass.
Jeff: Why don't you tell us the story?
What are you gonna roast on that thing?
Come on, Paul, tell them story.
No, I can't. It's a traumatic experience.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- We like traumatic stories.
- Not about me, but...
- Trauma bonds people.
- You can tell us.
- It bonds those who go through it,
- not the people you tell it to.
- Tell the fucking story!
All right!
So there's this bowling alley when we were growing up.
You guys might remember it- Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl?
It was in Brighton, right?
That's probably why it was called Brighton Bowl.
We used to go there for birthday parties or with my dad for the weekend.
This one time, I asked my dad if we could go.
He's like, "No. The bowling alley's closed."
This marshmallow's so burnt!
It turned out there had been a break-in.
All the employees were held at gunpoint. After they had been gagged and beaten, they were tied to chairs.
The chairs...
they were set in a circle, so that way everybody was forced to watch everybody else.
And then the robber, this sick maniac, he goes and finds one of those little ball-peen hammers.
And then one by one... he smashed the backs of their heads open with the hammer.
Everyone had to watch their friends die, knowing that they'd soon be next.
Ball-peen...
The guy doesn't stop there.
He breaks out the fire axe.
The alarm goes off...
he doesn't give a shit.
He hacked off all of their limbs.
The cops found six bloody torsos tied to the bowling seats.
Blood everywhere...
Turns out the guy was some disgruntled employee.
That was my childhood playground.
Bert, you asshole, it's not funny.
Yes it is, you fucking slut.
Jeff?
What?
Tell them about the happy bald guy.
- No, I can't take it. - He gave us our shoes and quarters for the video games.
There was a room with a pool table, but my dad wouldn't let us go there.
The bald guy was always happy, always smiling.
But the killer got him too.
When the cops searched the place, they found hacked off limbs at the end of the bowling lanes.
The guy had bowled people's organs.
Arms, legs, everything.
They found the bald guy's head in the ball return.
- He was still smiling.
- Oh, no.
I knew you were full of shit!
You suck!
No! It was in the paper. I swear!
I'm laughing because
Jeff is an asshole and he's making me laugh.
I swear...
I loved this place.
I still remember the sounds... the cracking, the bouncing. The smell of the shoes, the sound of the Q-Bert machine...
Holy shit!
What are you doing? !
- I'm cool.
- Are you spying on us?
- I'm cool.
- Is your dog friendly?
Yeah, he's cool.
This is Dr. Mambo.
Here, boy.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.
Is it "Dr." like a physician or a professor?
Yeah, he's a professor... of being a dog.
Oof! Faced!
Scratch-moded.
It's a positive bonfire.
Got room for one more?
Actually, we were having a private conversation, if you don't mind.
That's cool.
I guess I'll smoke all this weed by myself.
All: No, no. It's fine.
It's not that private.
Awesome.
Yeah, sit right here.
Bert: I think he's gonna fuck her.
Guy: Awesome.
- Wait, so your name was...
- Justin...
- but you can call me "Grim."
- Grim.
Like Grimace?
"Grim" is my skating name.
I got it in Berkeley while competing in the X-Games.
Really?
Karen's going to go to Berkeley.
Dude... awesome.
I love Berkeley.
People there are so wacked.
I met these guys and they had me fucked up for five days straight.
They wouldn't let me drink anything but beer.
Yeah, I've done that, except I did it with JD.
Karen's got a great idea.
We should only drink beer for the rest of the trip.
I could probably do that, but I doubt you could.
I'll bet you. I can only drink beer the rest of the trip.
If I drink anything else, you can have the rest of my supply.
All right, you're on.
We only drink beer.
Bert: You're on.
So, you're a skater?
Is that your occupation?
Oh, crap.
Party's over.
Hey Justin...
Grim... you want to come inside?
I'd love to, but I left all this shit outside my tent.
It's starting to rain, if it gets fucked up, it's like $4,000 worth of shit pissed away.
How far away is your tent?
20 minutes away, but if I book I can be back in 30.
- Cool.
Bring the weed.
- I will.
Check you dudes later.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.
- Jeff: Freak.
- Karen: I thought he was funny.
Bert: How did it work?
What do you mean "how"?
It had a hose... a bunch of different settings, pulse, power... stream.
And you came every time?
Totally.
You can imagine my disappointment the first time I had sex.
Tell me about it.
What's that supposed to mean?
- I've got a better story. - Paul:
I'm sorry, but no story is better than Karen and the shower massage.
No, seriously.
One time I was masturbating... and my dog came up and started licking my balls.
Right as I came it stuck its tongue up my ass.
That's serious fucking masturbation talent right there.
Fucking good.
He'd better have brought more weed or I won't let him in.
Relax, pal. I'm coming.
His name's Grim.
Jesus Christ.
Help me... please.
I need a doctor.
Oh shit.
Man: Doctor.
Yeah, all right.
Somebody grab a blanket or something.
You... you shot me.
No, no, no.
There's no way this contagious fucker's coming in here.
- He's sick, for Christ's sake.
- You want him to come in here and touch all of your shit, your fucking soap...?
Let's throw him a blanket or something.
- Or your douche?
- Let's drive him to a doctor.
He's not coming in!
We're out of range.
I'm not getting anything.
- Fuck!
- What's that?
- He's in the car.
What?
- Jeff: Motherfucker.
- Karen: Why's he fucking with us?
- Grab your gun.
Fuck!
Hurry up!
He's in the car already!
Get out of the fucking car!
Get out of there.
Get out of the car!
Get out!
Get out of the fucking car!
Fuck!
Get the fuck out!
Get out of there!
- Fucker!
- You shot the car!
What was I supposed to do?
Oh my God!
Fuck!
Paul: Shit!
Shit!
Oh!
- Get him!
- He's coming towards us.
Stop or I'll fucking stab you!
Stop!
Stop!
Back off.
Fuck off!
Leave us alone!
Fuck off!
I know.
I know.
What else were we gonna do?
First he gets his shit all over the car, and I don't want him touching me, you, or anybody.
I think the rain will put him out.
He's dead anyway.
You saw that shit on him.
He looked like he was skinned alive.
We have to tell the police it wasn't our fault.
I think we should tell them now.
Calm down.
There's nothing we can do.
The car's fucked.
We need a mechanic.
We'll find somebody who knows one, and then we'll report the accident.
That's the keyword here.
It was an accident.
The guy's skin... holy shit.
You should clean up some of this shit while we're gone.
I'll save some for you guys.
- Just stick with the girls.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're a fucking pussy.
That's fucked up.
What's fucked up is you beating the shit out of my truck.
What about the jag-off with the rifle?
Did you forget about him?
We all fucked up that car, don't just put it on me.
Good morning, boys.
Are you going to kill each other now?
Where are you going?
To get help.
So... Bert and Jeff are gone.
I know.
Last night was a fucked up situation,
- and I think...
- That guy asked for our help.
We lit him on fire.
Can you understand if I'm not in a particularly social mood?
I got scared.
I was... I was just trying to help.
Karen...
I'm sorry, Paul.
Every time I close my eyes I see him.
It was an accident.
The guy was going to die anyway.
Better?
Yeah.
Thanks, Paul.
Jeff: Hello?
God damn it!
God damn it!
God damn it!
God damn it!
Hold it! You there!
Do you see this?
! Do you see this shit? !
We didn't see anything.
Tell Murray I can't eat this shit.
Some animal's been running around infecting everything.
What am I supposed to do with a sick hog? Huh?
I am not about to eat that meat.
Would you?
- No, I'm a vegetarian.
- None of this shit is good.
It's all sick.
It's all gotta go back.
I want me a new hog!
We were just looking for a mechanic.
Mechanic?
You won't find one around here.
- You'll have to go to town.
- Bert: That's the thing.
Our car's busted, so we can't get into town.
We need somebody to take us into town
- so we can find a mechanic.
- Oh.
I've already been in town today, sorry.
All right, if you do go back, would you tell us?
We're staying at a cabin, and... we don't know Murray.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, of course, of course.
Why didn't you just come out and say that?
Come on inside, I've got a radio.
We'll call Ricky.
He's got a tow truck.
- Call Ricky.
- Ricky.
Sorry to bother you, but this crazy guy came out of the woods and tried to trash our car.
Woman: Sounds terrible.
I have some juice.
So this person damaged your car?
It was just this crazy hermit.
Real dangerous.
- We chased him away with bats.
- It wasn't Henry, was it?
Nah, shit, never.
Henry?
My cousin Henry.
He knows about that ordinance.
He wouldn't do something like that.
You hit him with a bat?
Both: No.
No, it wasn't Henry.
Our friend Walter, he got drunk.
One thing led to another...
- That's no good.
- Yeah.
I've got a great idea.
Why don't we take a walk down ourselves?
- It's really nice out.
- We'll just walk.
- I haven't seen the scenery.
- You sure?
Ricky's awfully handy.
- Thanks for your help.
- Are you sure?
A little fresh air sounds great.
We really appreciate your help.
Take care.
We burned Henry.
Fuck!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello?
- Ah!
- Bert, you dick-nose.
- Shut up.
What the hell?
- Did you find anybody?
- No, nothing.
I followed the path that the old guy ran, but I couldn't find him.
He could still be alive.
No, it's impossible.
- Want any beef jerky?
- No, put it away.
- Why?
- It's not our house.
So?
- Did you find a phone?
- No.
I felt weird looking around. There's nobody here.
We found this other place, but... there was nobody there either.
I wonder if the cops know about it yet.
I doubt it.
If they did know, they'd have been at the cabin by now.
Good morning.
Deputy Winston, Bunyan County Sheriff's Department.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
I'm on patrol in my jurisdiction and I heard there was a lot of commotion here last night.
I wanted to know what the story is.
Yeah, sure.
Some guy tried to break into our cabin.
And he was sick.
I don't know what kind of disease he had, but he was a mess.
I have to report this.
Yeah, totally.
My friends are out looking for a neighbor so we could call you.
We don't have a phone here.
Everyone uses radios.
That's what I use.
Hey...
Looks like you guys were doing some pretty good partying, huh?
Yeah, you know, we were drinking... and then this guy came along and tried to break into the cabin.
We had no choice but to get rough.
I feel awful, but he was going crazy.
He smashed into our car, and then he wouldn't come out, so... we had to hit him.
We hurt him.
We were terrified.
We didn't know what to do.
That's why we went to look for help-
Hey, man, I told you...
I'm gonna make a report.
Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna come back.
Looks like you guys scared him away pretty good.
I ain't gonna let him ruin your fun.
Thank you.
My friend's inside right now and she's pretty freaked out.
She wants to go home.
We all kind of do.
A lady friend, huh?
I bet you like to party... with the ladies.
Karen: Paul?
Is everything okay?
Howdy, ma'am.
Everything's fine.
Just go back inside, have yourself a big 40, just party.
Umm... okay.
Oh, Daddy, why are you talking about leaving?
You've got to stay and party.
That's why we came here in the first place.
I'm telling you, this is a major party town.
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?
You know what it's like when you go to a new town and you're the new guy?
All the girls see you walking down the street... they don't know you've got five pounds of dangling meat.
They're looking for no commitment.
- You understand what I'm saying?
- I've heard that theory before.
This is that town.
It's like when I go party up at Wambusau.
My cousin goes to school there.
When I party at Wambusau, I know I'm gonna get pussy.
Plus the girls there don't know I'm a deputy.
So I know they're gonna party hard with me.
Believe me, man, they do.
That's too bad, I bet you ruled this town before you had a badge.
Yeah, but a badge makes you grow up quick.
Shit, this guy went and did a number on your ride.
I'm gonna put out an APB.
We're gonna catch this guy.
Yeah, it wasn't totally him.
We hit it too.
But we were trying to scare him away.
Could you get somebody up here to fix it?
What do I look like?
An idiot?
I'll have someone up here by tomorrow afternoon.
You're top priority.
You're the party man.
Do you realize how many great parties we're gonna have?
Fortune's shining on you.
I know where all the big parties are at.
Remember, my name is Winston.
You know how to get a hold of me, right?
- 9-1-1?
- That's it, my man.
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.
Did he say he was gonna report this shit or not?
I think he is.
He didn't make it seem like we did anything wrong.
He said he'd get a tow truck up here.
- Sounds weird to me.
- The guy was weird.
Once he saw Karen, he didn't want to leave.
Has Karen left her room yet?
No, she's still sleeping.
I don't know what's up with her.
She wants to get out of here as soon as she can.
- Puts a kink in your plan, huh?
- What plan?
What plan?
The plan you've been trying to execute since eighth grade.
No, there's no plan.
Not anymore.
Whatever.
You guys are funny.
Fucking... she likes you because you're nice to her and she's nice to you because she can control you.
- Fucking, you're nice to her...
- Bert, don't move.
Bert: Fuck.
- It's that freak's dog.
- Should I hit it?
- I don't know.
If you're gonna hit it, hit it hard.
So where's Grim?
He's out there rotting.
There's some sick shit in the woods and the hermit's spreading it around.
I'm not waiting for that deputy to come back.
- Let's get out of here now.
- Should we say something on our way out, like, "By the way, we burned some guy alive"?
- Yes.
- No.
- Jeff.
- Fine, we'll tell the cops.
We have to.
They're gonna figure it out.
The deputy knows something happened.
We're the only outsiders.
They're gonna trace it back to us.
I feel nauseous.
Karen...
How soon can you get us out of here?
I don't know if I can fix the car.
I'm thinking I could make it drivable, we could drive into town and tell them what happened.
And that'll be that, right?
But you're gonna have to watch me with the gun.
I'm not gonna go out there with that fucking dog around.
I need a bath.
Jeff's mom has the stupidest ideas-
"Let's get a cabin." So gay.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
That's okay.
I think Marcy made some chili.
I'm not hungry.
All right, then. I'll let you go back to sleep.
No, wait.
Stay.
- Fuck.
- Why did you stop?
- Would you shoot him already?
Don't stop. Keep working!
- Shoot it!
- If it gets closer, I can hit it.
Just keep working!
Oh my God!
Shit!
Marcy!
She's got it!
She's sick.
Oh no, she's fucking got it.
- Oh shit.
- I think I'm really sick.
Oh shit.
Stay in your fucking bed!
- Bert, can you help me?
- Calm down.
No! Get the fuck out!
Everybody out!
- Just get the fuck out!
- Bert, please!
- Stay in your fucking bed!
- I'm bleeding.
- Get the fuck out!
- Calm down!
- Can I go to the bathroom?
Listen, you bitch! Get the fuck in bed!
- Leave her alone!
- Leave her alone!
- Fucking bitch!
- What the fuck is your problem?
- She's your fucking friend!
She's sick!
She's not coming near me!
I'm doing this for you and all you fucks!
- Don't leave me!
- Stop it!
- Bert, Bert... calm down.
- Oh God.
- Okay.
What?
Fuck you, guys.
Karen, I'm sorry.
We just don't want to get it.
- I'm going to die in here.
- Paul: No, you're not.
Karen, please.
We're going to get help now.
- What about that guy's dog?
- Someone'll keep watch with the gun.
We'll bolt the door shut.
Somebody'll be out here.
We won't leave you alone.
I want to go home.
Ah!
- Ah!
Karen?
Karen.
Come on, Karen, you've got to eat.
Let me know if you need anything else, okay?
Okay?
Better close the door, Marcy.
I don't want to infect everyone.
- Oh God.
- What are you doing?
My friend...
she's very sick.
- You are very sick.
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm-
- That's my wife in there!
My friend's dying!
We need a phone, please.
- Get the fuck off my property!
- Shit!
- Git!
Where have you been?
Did you find anyone?
Well, come on inside. Marcy made chili.
Nobody's hungry?
- What if Karen used those bowls? - Jesus!
I washed them!
He's right.
I'm not gonna eat until we get back to town.
Jeff: You know, any of you guys could have it.
I know we checked, but I'm not gonna sleep near you guys.
So go sleep in the car and give us all a break.
The car?
That thing's a germ factory!
- I don't even want to ride in it!
- Calm down. I cleaned it.
- So why don't you sleep in it?
- Maybe I will!
You're right.
We should prepare our own meals.
Who am I?
I'm melting!
I'm burning!
What's your problem?
You're gonna burn down this place!
- What?
- You asshole!
- Fucking prick!
- Marcy: Stop it!
- Jeff!
- Motherfucker!
Shut the fuck up!
Christ!
I can't take it anymore!
Just no more yelling.
We can eat alone, we can sleep alone. Whatever.
We have to talk to each other.
We have to work together.
Bert, you just lost the bet.
Shit!
Okay, Karen, he's gone.
We're gonna stay out here all night for you, all right?
Karen?
Fuck!
Come on, let's go, everybody. Hurry up!
The Jeep's running.
Jeff, come on!
Come on, Karen.
We've got to go.
I think I've got a fever.
Let's go!
Come on, Jeff, let's go!
Come on, motherfucker!
All right...
put her in the back.
I don't think we should sit next to her.
Fuck off!
Put her in the front, then.
No, I'm not driving with her sitting next to me.
I'm driving.
Just get in the fucking car.
Fine.
Paul: Karen?
Karen, you okay?
- Marcy: Oh God, Karen.
Marcy: We've got to get her to town.
She's gonna die.
Paul: She's not going anywhere.
Come on.
You guys coming?
Are you nuts?
She just infected the car.
- I'll take my chances, man.
- I can't leave Karen.
- Bert, you don't look so hot.
- I don't feel so hot either.
But the longer we sit here, the more she lies and rots!
How sick are you?
Did that old guy touch you?
This is fucking horseshit!
Come on! - Did he?
- Fuck this, man!
Bert: I'll get her a fucking doctor.
Marcy: We should move her back to the shed.
Oh God, she's bleeding again.
Don't move her.
It's okay, Karen.
We're gonna get help.
- Going somewhere?
- Anywhere but here.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Jeff?
- Just let him go.
- Jeff!
Jeff!
Don't fucking come near me.
Stop! I don't want to get sick.
I don't want any of us getting sick!
But you two fuckers insist on touching her!
Now she's bleeding all over both you guys.
So you two can fucking rot!
But not me!
No fucking way!
Not me!
Asshole!
Oh shit.
We're all going to get it.
We're all going to get sick... and Jeff's in the woods getting drunk.
Bert's going to get help.
Karen will be fine.
I promise.
It's like being on a plane when you know it's going to crash.
Everyone around you is screaming and yelling,
"We're going down!
We're going down!"
All you really want to do is grab the person next to you and fuck the shit out of them 'cause you know you're gonna be dead soon anyway.
- You don't use condoms?
- Don't worry. I'm healthy.
Oh fuck!
Hello?
Somebody help!
Hello!
What the hell happened to you?
My friend, she's sick.
- You don't look so good.
- I know.
There's this disease.
I think all my friends are getting it.
Do you know where a hospital is around?
Yeah.
Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.
I'll get a doctor.
Bert: Thanks.
Pancakes!
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes.
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes!
Dennis, I told you to stay on the swing!
Dennis!
Fuck!
God damn it!
What pancakes!
Why did you come here?
Now look what you've done.
I just need a doctor, okay?
Look what you've done to this poor boy!
- What has he done to you?
- I just need... a fucking doctor, man!
I already lost one boy.
I ain't losing another.
What if the doctors can't fix my boy?
You get my boy sick, it's the same as killing him.
- It's murder!
- What?
! You being sick, that's your problem.
Now Dennis is sick, that's my problem!
And if I get sick, that's Lucille's problem.
So we got to stop the problem.
We got to stop the problem right now!
Fenster!
Rifle!
Fuck you, man!
There are some kids in a cabin.
They got a disease.
They just gave it to Dennis.
We'll need the kit.
Jesus, Paul, you did a number on my back.
I'm gonna go find Jeff and we're walking out of here.
- What about Bert?
- I can't wait for him.
- I have to get out of here.
- What about Karen?
Paul?
- Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Shit.
Up here!
Help me!
- Bert!
- They're coming for you.
- Who?
The deputy?
- No, the guy from the store.
I knew these kids were trouble the minute they stole from Cad.
Good God.
They're doing sacrifices or something.
This ain't Christian.
Good night, fucker!
Got him.
Jeff!
Jeff!
It's the water!
Wherever you are, don't drink the water!
Hello?
Jeff?
Jeff!
Jeff?
Fuck!
¢Ü So cheer up, things will get better... ¢Ü
Here, have a big beer.
Come on, drink up.
You've got some sexy hair.
You got sexy shoes, too.
Shit, what the fuck happened to you, man?
The tow truck.
What happened to the tow truck, Winston?
Oh shit.
The fucking party man.
I'm so fucking sorry about the tow truck.
I sent it, it broke down.
I had to get a tow truck to get that fucking tow truck. What do you need, you need a ride?
Yeah.
Yeah, a ride would be good.
Radio: Winston!
- Winston, do you copy?
- Yes, sir, I copy.
I'm still looking for that underage booze party.
Radio:
Never mind. We've got bigger problems.
Some kids up in a cabin are on a killing spree.
There's two, possibly three casualties.
They are armed and hostile.
Do not go anywhere near them!
They've got some kind of skin virus that will eat you alive.
So if you do see them, do not hesitate to shoot them.
- Do you copy?
- Yes. Can you repeat the last part?
I said, if you see the kids, just shoot them on sight!
So, how about that ride?
What the fuck?
Just shoot him!
- Hey, I can't.
- You heard the walkie-talkie dude!
- The fucking gun is in the car.
- I just want to get into town.
- Why don't you just relax?
- Get away, fucking fruitcake!
You're not going anyplace!
- Fuck!
- Shit.
Come on, be cool.
Oh fuck!
You fucking idiot!
You just fucked up the whole party, you fucking idiot!
The party's over, Winston.
Man: Son.
We need you to start from the beginning.
Everybody's dead.
We need to know... where you got this disease.
It was a guy from the woods.
Oh God, he looked like Bert's marshmallow.
Paul: He told me he would get a tow truck.
I should have killed him too.
Doctor: We're not equipped to handle a situation like this.
Cook County is his only shot.
Fine.
You put him in the car... and I'll take care of him.
Hey, look who's waking up!
The fucking party man!
I guess the party ain't over, huh?
We have a long night of partying.
- A long night.
- Water.
- I ain't got no water.
All I got's a 40.
But if you want some water, I'll find some for you, okay?
You just sit tight, I'll take care of you.
Holy shit.
They're dead.
My God.
All dead.
I made it.
I made it.
Oh God, I made it.
I did it.
I fucking made it.
I fucking made it.
I did it.
I fucking made it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I fucking made it!
I fucking made it!
I made it!
I fucking made it!
You got rid of that other one, right?
Hey, I think there's another one in the basement.
Come on, boys!
Let's do this!
Hey, fellas!
It's been a rough morning up here.
Lemonade, mister?
Thanks, son.
Don't mind if I do.
That's five cents.
Businessmen.
You almost take after your granddad.
Cad: They're running me out of my own business.
Stealing me blind right here.
Whoa!
Now, that is mighty fine.
Mighty fine.
Grab a cup, boys.
This round's on me.
Here you go, all polished and everything.
Ain't that a beauty?
Look at that, honey.
Looks like it's brand new.
- Hi, my nigga, how are you?
- What's up, nigga?
Where you been, man?
H
February, 10th
Oh, shit...
What a fucking sanitary landfill on a rainy day like this... right after going through such a big business.
What about the scientific investigation team?
They will be here in a moment, for I've already made some contact with them.
What the hell is this!
It's pouring.
What is it?
What a fast show up!
Why don't you say hello to these people?
Yes, sir!
I'm Kang, Tae-hyun. Eh~hh
We're going, you son of a bitch!
Let's get moving!
Hey, let's do a good job together.
It doesn't look like a mere rape and murder, although we cannot tell exactly what happened before going through the exact autopsy.
Ahh... it's chilling.
Are you okay?
Ahh...
I'm a little scared...
It's the first time for me to come out for the investigation...
After the guy murdered this girl, he might have thrown her body away here...
Such a sick bastard!
He picked out so dirty a place!
No, no... so right a place
Hey!
Kang!
What are you doing there, you little punk!
Are you loafing around even on the first day of your investigation?
Bullshit!
He seems to thinks he's the only one taking all the troubles.
To find the clues requires so much toils of running around all the time...
Damn it!
I'm convinced that somebody has bitten this umbilical cord off.
There's no need to look at this even under the microscope!
Do you mean then the mother delivered her baby for herself?
Well... that's...
What the hell did she do but to prevent conception in the right way?
Otherwise, she ought to have delivered her baby in the right way... damn it...
Anyway... damn it!
What brought it to death?
At present, too much bleeding seems to be the direct cause of its death... but... uhh...
I cannot draw the definite conclusion until going through a closer examination
And the body got rotten so quickly that it's nearly impossible to presume the date of death, actually.
February, 14th
We are now at the last stop.
Is she... drunk and fallen asleep?
Hey!
Hey!
Where is it!
Here...
Hey!
You late again?
[Skipped item nr. 49]
I'm sorry. What the fucking marvelous scene do I see, drawn up here with sleepless eyes...
Have you found out something?
Something?
There are thousands of people taking the buses!
Damn it! oh, damn it~!
You know when the heck the accident popped up?
You fools are always wise after the event!
The victim was strangled to death with a string from behind.
That means the victim was not acquainted with the murderer.
If they were acquainted with each other, she would have recognized before the guy had seated himself behind her.
Then, it will be wrong to assume that the murder derived from some grudge or infatuation.
Right.
I don't think that the murder has been intended in advance...
The motivation of this murder has yet to be grasped...
What about the schoolgirl found in a sanitary landfill?
A close examination proved that the embryo was extracted by force.
And the blood mark of the umbilical cord and that of the victim do not coincide.
Shin Hyun, who committed 6 murders and surrendered himself to the police 10 months ago... did the same patterned thing at that time...
First, a pregnant high school girl, and then, a parturient unwed mother.
Those two have something in common with Shin Hyun's victim in the point of being in unwanted pregnancy?
Right.
And then, he slew a lesbian, too.
An... an... and then, adding to this, he cut her ears off... the ears!
At present, Shin Hyun is in confinement, and the same murders are occurring... then... we'll have to see Shin Hyun.
It's time now...
Shin Hyun... Age 22...
Six women consecutively murdered, The sixth one Put the dead body in a bag and went to the metropolitan police station and confessed...
Bastard!
He's totally eccentric...
Sit!
A guy like you has the right to sit!
The introductions are late.
Detective Kang coming out of the metropolitan police station.
It was forgotten all this time. How does it feel to be getting attention!
Can you hear the voice?
I'll ask you simply.
Who the fuck is it!
From the heart or the soul to the body...
A sound from the body to the soul...
Have you experienced that kind of echoing abyss?
Just answer the questions I ask!
Before I slice your tongue...
I see you haven't heard yet what these pictures mean.
I can still hear the restless sound of the spirit.
Fury at foolish people who infringed upon lives like a person's possession...
It's beautiful isn't it?
The magnificence in the spot of redemption...
At the border line between life and death they do...
Open your ears to what they say.
And feel the flow.
If you don't feel the message echoing in the spirit It will be buried in abyss.
This person...
I wonder what he was thinking as the clear blood was spreading...
Have you ever thought about things like that?
Detective Kang, when you face the abyss you must bear in mind that the abyss also faces you.
And when you fight with a monster like me, it would be wise of you to not turn into a monster as well.
What... crazy bastard... really...
That scar...
I hope this case continues.
I think I will enjoy seeing you often.
You bastard...
Shit...
And...
Please give my regards to Detective Kim as well.
Because of the whole Detective Han business...
Her grief will be great.
It's a shame what happened to Detective Han.
Honestly those detectives who were in charge of the consecutive murders...
There was a reason they got mental disorders.
What about Shin Hyun?
Hyun was troubled with nightmares where his arm and leg were cut off, flowing in a bathtub full of blood.
Killing women due to God's calling...
He said the uneasiness and the nightmares went away.
Since that bastard isn't in a position to kill a girl, I guess the uneasiness and the nightmares will continue.
Did you say you were Detective Kang?
Just, just speak with ease.
It's not that Hyun hired someone else to start the murders again?
Is there by any chance any files on Shin Hyun?
A doctor doesn't reveal the individual information that he has on patients.
Dr. Chu, this information is needed to prevent future victims from coming out.
How about cooperating with us before having to go through a complicated process?
Okay. Do it your way.
To me, my patient is more important than a victim whose face I don't even know!
There's no doubt that bastard hired someone.
There's no need to do an investigation.
What we need to do now is immediately subpoena the bastard and cross examine him roughly.
That's the fastest way.
The copy cat part takes precedence.
What are you talking about?
Don't you know even after you've heard it?
Whether he copied someone or hired someone.
We have to catch him first.
Why are you ignoring the person who committed the crime for certain, and going backwards?
It's a case where we need to wait!
It's not the one again.
Shit!
Do you fucking remember that you and I are of the same rank?
Huhh...
Yep!
My guess is that before the last stop, at the last tunnel, he committed the crime, and got off.
Yes.
Since currently the radius is as wide apart as 1 kilometer, there's got to be something here...
Yes...
There's something here.
That's correct.
These two... The mother got a medical examination at our hospital.
They both seem like they're unmarried mothers but...
Well it seems like it's better for both sides not to ask about things like that, so I didn't ask.
A person by the name of Youngtaek Heo...
A month ago there was one who quit...
Why did he quit?
He secretly hoarded the hospital's equipment.
Well... There were things like surgical knives, right!
It seems that person has a criminal record.
A criminal record?
February, 28th
What are you doing!
Why aren't you coming in?
I'm going in! Since you're taking full responsibility...
Huh.
Miyun's not just a common person.
At that age she's at a higher rank than me.
When she was an inspector she was awesome.
But if you get to know her better, there's no one as pitiful as her.
Because she came to us after Detective Han committed suicide...
Do they have anything to do with each other?
They were engaged.
Because of that Shin Hyun, Jung Woo was in a state of shock!
When he was at a lost I should have helped him.
Indeed he catches with his own hands and then lets them go. That's reasonable since he killed six and then confessed to you.
Youngtaek Heo!
Oops...
Son-of-a bitch!
Don't worry. He's a nasty fellah.
He's shot twice on the chest but was still breathing.
Only a real nasty one can do such a cruel murder.
What is it?
He and Shin Hyun were in the same prison...
Youngtaek Heo's gives his regards.
He was a really good kid...
If he didn't meet that somebody that would have been true.
I see you're still locking yourself up.
Even when you see this...
How can you even say such a thing?
The earring is pretty but it smells of blood.
A year ago that woman also had an earring on, but we haven't been able to find it yet.
Attachment leads quickly us to the core of abyss but can never go near the essence.
Have you ever thought about the blood that runs through you?
What?
Dirty blood that won't erase even when you want to wash it.
I'm talking about the blood that transfers to me from a dirty body and an immoral soul?
We can't go near the blue heavens.
We can never go to the place where innocent souls live.
We?
I'm just smelling the blood.
The odor coming in just before you open that door and come in...
Youngtaek Heo's state of consciousness is uncertain, but the fingerprints and the high school girl's umbilical cord's bloody mark is a perfect match with the bus incident murder. And from then on evidence for the three murder cases have been prepared.
But, the fact that, he has kept up the same murder patterns as Shin Hyun, and the fact that he was imprisoned in the same jail is something that's left up to question.
And the murder motive is not clear.
Did you say that the roundabout investigation results stated she was a lesbian?
That's correct.
Even in an urgent situation, he copied Shin Hyun's pattern exactly... he re-enacted it.
Youngtaek Heo was imprisoned in the same jail as Shin Hyun, and if you think about the fact that he continued the use of Shin Hyun's patterns, we cannot eliminate the possibility of Shin Hyun hiring him.
Detective Kim, there was there nothing in the results of those account we investigated right?
And did you know that since they strictly regulate condemned criminals, the common errand boy couldn't meet with Youngtaek Heo.
No.
That bastard knew Youngtaek Heo.
That's what the bastard said with his own mouth.
Did Shin Hyun know Youngtaek Heo?
So, is there anything that's changed?
The incident arouse by Shin Hyun hiring someone, what does that mean?
It isn't too late now.
We have to get a subpoena now and pursuit the bastard.
Shin Hyun got the death penalty at the first trial and didn't appeal.
The bastard will die soon.
So what purpose is there to catch a bastard like him.
To him the death penalty again?
If Shin Hyun knows Youngtaek Heo then the story is different.
Shin Hyun committed 6 murders, and there is still three left.
A second, third, Youngtaek Heo can come out.
In this case, the evidence and witness are secure.
There is nothing you can do about it unless you turn upside down the general situation.
Sergeant Lee, we will conclude that this case was copycat crime of an mentally unstable person, and let's hand it over to the prosecution.
What's next?
Yes...
I'm Bae Kilsoo.
He agreed to stand as a witness against the gang's boss Yongman but the bastard disappeared.
I'll quit.
Are you out of your mind?
I'd rather quit than be able to do nothing every time something happens.
You, come out here!
Wait...
Let go!
Let go! Of this...
You... Bastard! Why have you been this way since yesterday?
Come out!
Here...
You know why as well!
Park, does a detective grab a criminal by the head?
No... no...
Shit...
If you're that smart why be a detective when you can be a judge and a public prosecutor?
Then why are stupid people so complicated?
Kang!
Have a drink straight down and forget everything, let's forget!
Cheers~
Cheers!
Fucking smart serial killers...
What the fuck!
Fucking dumb detective!
If you don't have the brains, then you've got to have the guts to catch them.
Someone's come... someone's come...
Aww, shit, a woman who's fucking smart has come.
Hey, our Detective Kim also has come, so we'll have another rally to strengthen the unity.
Okay... hostess!
Give us another bottle of Cham-i-sul soju!
It's not a rally to strengthen the unity but a farewell party.
Hey.
Stop it. Bastard.
I'll rip your fucking mouth...
For starters, let's just forget about this case for awhile.
And your not trying to avoid it?
I'm not avoiding it, I'm going back to it.
I'm putting the case in my mind and looking at it in the long run.
Although if our guess was wrong, it would be better...
Okay, it's not like he's the only murderer in Korea.
There are so many murderers just waiting for us!
A lot!
Do you know something?
You're a lot meaner than I thought...
Yeah. I'm mean.
But, we won't be able to solve the case if we handle the situation with our hearts like you.
Okay... you're right.
We have to control our minds or else we'll go crazy like somebody.
Hey!
What's the matter with you guys!
Really...
Dick son of a bitch shit really...
Hey~ Leave it!
I'll take care of it...
A woman who has ruined her innocence doesn't have the right to get married.
That's why he cut the ring finger the 4th time I believe.
I see you haven't been able to find the connection string between Hyun and this murder.
Why do you think he copied the murders of Hyun?
If you're curious about something go find Youngtaek Heo who's wandering around confused in the hospital.
Yes.
This is Kang...
Where?
Okay...
It's about another case?
Go.
If this case is solved, then there's no reason for us to meet again?
Even though you're the head doctor, a record of you visiting Shin Hyun too much...
If the case is reopened... that kind of factor will be used as evidence that you're a possible suspect.
Shit Kang...
where the hell is Kang?
If we wait any longer Kilsoo Bae will start to notice.
How is it?
Standby at G3 zone! Will carefully watch the situation!
Okay R2!
Shit bastard... Shit...
Oh my gosh!
What is this!
What the fuck is this.
Ayiee~
Follow me.
It's like maze...
I guess this place is right...
The trail stops here...
Where did it go? Lt...
Did you contact the scientific investigation team?
Look for it! Until they come...
If there's no footprint, did it just fly away?
Shit!
Aww, fuck son of a bitch.
The victim has no relation to Youngtaek Heo, and is a third party, the criminal re-enacted the method that Shin Hyun used in murders.
10 months ago the victim... before marriage she had two abortions.
Shin Hyun believed that she didn't have the right to wear the wedding ring, so he cut off her ring finger on her left hand.
So it's the same crime again...
Uh... what happened to the footprint at the scene of the crime?
It's a 270mm man's dress shoe.
We're guessing the weight is approximately 70kg.
How was the next murder of Shin Hyun's carried out?
Next...
In order to understand the nobility of life, after murdering the doctor who was to perform an abortion, he excavated the doctor's uterus.
For the sake of life's nobility, to murder cruelly... must I consult a fortune teller about Shin Hyun's future...
The last murder victim of Shin Hyun was a woman in her 50's.
Up to now the identity was not revealed.
Concerning this one patient, Shin Hyun just won't open his mouth.
She is so drunk...
Hey, do that again, bitch!
Hey...
Hey!
Who the fuck are you?
What are you doing now?
Hey, hey!
Oh, right...
You're the fucking fellow of that bitch?
Take away...
You bastard!
You fucking asshole!
Whom are you calling in the name of bitch?
I don't know at all.
I'm busy running away from the gangs of Yongman.
How could I kill someone?
Hey, son of a bitch!
Bastard!
When did I tell you that you murdered someone?
Just inform us if you saw suspicious man or heard strange sound when the murder case happened.
You idiot!
Suspicious man, and strange sound?
That place is not inn. So I didn't hear the strange sound.
Use your brain!
Shit!
How could I remember all the thing?
I'm busy running away...
A son of a bitch!
Are you fooling me?
Do you want to die?
I said I don't know at all.
And...
Is my head the Bell of Boshin-gak? Why don't you fill the number of 33?
So keep count of them!
Four, five, six...
seven, eight...
Now, hand over to the prosecution.
The results of the second round postmortem examination that you requested have come in.
But...
But what?
Umm, the victim of this case, unlike the other victims, has been revealed to be a virgin.
Shin Hyun's first open trial was proceeded five times. Those who attended the whole trials are all of them 37.
I think Shin Hyun's adherents are among them.
Among them by excluding the journalists and the persons concerned...
Youngjin Choi!
This guy! Such a brat!
Youngjin Choi.
Age 31. Now an abstract painter.
An Ex-lecturer of a university.
Last year... convicted of assaulting a few girls sexually.
Also Shin Hyun's senior in his university.
Menstruation usually occurs every twenty-eight days.
Given the body's decomposition state, the first case... seems to have occurred...
28 days before the third case took place in a techno-bar.
And the first, third, and fifth murder that Shin Hyun committed occurred periodically in every 28 days.
As detective Kim said I admit that the odd-numbered cases occurred on every 28 days, but the even-numbered cases occurred very... irregularly!
That's the three days in the middle of the menstrual cycle.
Supposing the menstrual period... consists of 28 days ordinary women ovulate for two or three days after two weeks pass since the beginning of menstruation.
That is, the even-numbered cases happened during the ovulation period.
An unmarried Mom, abortion, and...
All the cases are related to pregnancy!
That explains why that fellow had waited for 10 months!
The guy had to wait until the baby came out into the world!
After 10 month, he started again.
Did you kill someone else as you did Youngtaek Heo?
Whom do you mean?
Are you really ignorant of?
What do you know the most silliest thing is?
It's to be sure of his own knowledge about something...
Shut the fuck up!
You bastard!
You looks excited that everything goes along as you planned...
Your look... you know what?
That is the same as yours.
I think you know that every expression has some meaning beneath it.
Those who strive hard to hide themselves...
Those who pretend to be innocent in spite of toying with others' lives...
Are you throwing those words to yourself?
You don't understand the "dimensions" now!
Dimensions... you are just a condemned criminal who murdered six innocent women and now awaits your death!
You see things so superficially!
Give ear to an abyss!
Unless, you will be stuck in the six corpses.
Are you distinguishing your deeds from Children's?
Children do on their own.
They are not mean like you enough to entangle other person... you say meanness...
Death is the sole relief to those who abandon others' lives cowardly as well as those who are abandoned by them...
Someday, you'll get to comprehend...
We have no more time to listen to your story... you are stronger than I thought...
You must hate me...
for I led detective Han to death...
You cannot close the wound by covering it with a cold look and a stinging tongue!
Are you free from the man who left his beloved behind and kill himself?
Do you think you could have been free in this situation?
"Forever with you Jungwoo"
Jungwoo Han, what drove him to death?
What is the knot he couldn't undo?
What a pain he was in!
Why couldn't I soothe the pain?
Maybe... it was inevitable and you could not hold him back.
He was just a helpless and weak creature...
I think the same mistake is not gonna be made...
Time's over.
I've gotta go.
Someday, we can enjoy together the light from the sunny sky...
I've been glad with you.
I've been here with my mom, I used to call her my sister.
Why do you think I called her as my sister?
That's how we could make a living.
I didn't know the meaning at that time.
Isn't this world a shit?
Every night, I had to see my mom with different guys.
I grew up in a district where ladies under the red light set with their legs crossed.
I called them sis.
In such way, I could distinguish them from my mom.
I would walked along this seashore with my mom and sometimes she would carry me on her back.
Where's she now?
Dead.
To me, she was real only in this seashore.
March 28th
Hello... yes...
okay...
I see.
Do you forget today is the day?
Youngjin Choi, that chap, was diagnosed as mentally deranged, and then received medical attention from Dr. Chu on his probation.
Chu Kyoungsook, I knew this, sick bitch!
Walk her off right now!
Not now... just watch her.
I don't think Dr. Chu is willing to be under our investigation.
Just watch her again?
Knowing somebody will be murdered today?
- What the fuck?
- Get off, you idiot!
Open the fuck the door!
It's the police.
As they grow up, they gets furious at the violence which victimized them.
And as a result, they come to seek an object that they can project their fury on.
They usually target women that's because they want to show off their strength.
The class is over.
See you next week.
Just calm down!
It's me, detective Kim!
It's me, detective Kim!
It's comfortable... and warm...
Did you feel comfortable until you came out in the world?
Ummm...
Why?
What do you see?
It's okay... say it!
No, no...
Don't do that! It hurts.
If you say it, it will not hurt you.
Say it, what do you see?
Something glitters...
like metal... that presses my head.
No, oh no...
Mom... mommy...
please don't do that.
It hurts me!
Mom!
If you kill me, you will die, too!
Whom do you mean?
You're gonna kill me...
If you kill me, you'll die too!
You're gonna kill me...
Pardon me...
Mommy!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
The possibility of an embryo surviving the abortion is under 3%.
Shin Hyun was born in this possibility, his memory of aggression that he felt in the womb.
confronting the abortion, comes to control his subconscious.
His aggressive activity can be regarded as expression of his hatred toward women... which comes from his fear in the womb.
The execution was ordered all of a sudden.
Seeing what happened to Dr. Chu... and with people fussing over saying this is a replay serial murders, they must have felt it necessary to end this before things got worse.
How was the end?
He took it calm and serene.
His last words were he killed his mother.
His mother?
Are you trying to quit smoking or... is it that you can't get rid of the thought of smoking?
There was someone I loved...
He also tried to catch Shin Hyun.
What would he do in my situation?
Ah, shit...
Kyoungsook Chu appears on the passenger list but Youngjin Choi doesn't.
Let me see!
The owner of the basement office. What kind of person is he?
It's a bastard named Youngmo Kim.
I smell something suspicious about him... that son of a bitch.
The owner of the basement workroom, Kim Youngmo is proved to be a homeless!
Choi, Youngjin has lived by the name of Kim, Youngmo until now.
And Youngjin Choi bought plane tickets with that name every time Kyoungsook Chu was flying to Kangneung and in Kangneung we found a villa Youngjin Choi owns.
The important thing is... the dates of murder and Choi, Youngjin and Dr. Chu's visit to Kangneung are coincidental.
- Here!
- Yes, sir!
Turn it over.
April 14th Another person moving through me...
I could control it at first, but now, I can't.
Repeated murder...
I am getting more and more afraid of that existence.
What can I choose to do now that I can no longer control him?
Dr. Chu's patient, Youngjin Choi had a split personality and believed that he himself was Shin Hyun.
Youngjin who was indulged in diabolism worshiped Shin Hyun frantically, so raised his another self, Shin Hyun.
But he seems to have been very afraid of serial murders even though he considered Shin Hyun, who was inside him, was his salvation.
So he committed suicide... but why change the object of his murder?
I think he was confused.
It is speculated that this was a mistake caused by the battle with the uncontrollable self.
What about Shin Hyun's maneuvering?
That point will be made clear when the psychiatric test of Youngtaek Heo is completed.
Including the one in Techno-bar, in three cases, the bully is considered to be Youngjin Choi, according to the investigation team.
Okay, then, arrange for a press conference!
Hey, Kang!
Are you afraid?
Fucking bastard!
He always makes me crazy!
Anyway this case was finished.
Don't worry and undo a package!
Is all the end?
Now Detective Han will be in peace in the grave.
So... forget it!
Anyway both Shin Hyun and Youngjin Choi have passed away. So nothing would happened.
Detective Park!
Was this foot's size 270?
Hello?
Speaking.
What the hell are you doing?
Let me know the reason!
You drove me to distraction!
Really... why do you...
What?
What is Youngtaek Heo's phone number?
Why?
What is after-hypnosis?
It means... if hypnotist give some allusion to his hypnotic... the hypnotic go into hypnosis automatically at the appointed time.
Do you mean the hypnotic could be hypnotic state in spite of the hypnotist's death?
In that day, it is natural that there was only three people's bloodstained-footprint in that spot.
The footprint of Detective Kang, Youngjin Choi and me...
But there are only two.
The woman's is mine, and the rest man's... either Youngjin Choi's or Detective Kang's...
Youngjin Choi's foot size is 285...
So it will be other's.
But the size was 270mm which was detected in the prostitute quarter and basement.
It's same as Detective Kang's footprint.
Miyun, will you please drop that subject?
Look into the list of Youngjin Choi's phone call.
He phoned to Detective Kang and Youngtaek Heo just before the murder case.
The phone's bell sound which I heard at the basement was same as Detective Kang's.
Do you mean that the phone's bell sound is the implication of hypnosis?
I have no word in reply.
How could the bell sound implicate the hypnosis?
Through cellular phone, some sound should be traveled to him.
The sound is the implication of hypnosis.
Fuck!
Detective Kang is not.
Why don't you say that this is not the truth!
Don't do that!
Put the gun down.
We can find a way.
We heard that something could break the hypnotic spell.
Put it down.
Look me straight in the eyes!
Hey, Kang!
It's not your fault.
You had no choice.
There is nothing to worry about.
I wish I didn't meet him.
How's that for a picture?
-A nice shot.
-It's fabulous.
Just like a postcard.
-Is that the view from the hotel?
-We had that aerial up there.
And those smelly old mattresses.
Ellen was completely out of it after three cocktails.
She was so smashed there!
-She was so pissed there!
-He's making me out to be a drunk.
I don't find that funny.
They had 32 cocktails!
32!
Could you please take that awful slide off now?
It's embarrassing.
If I worked in television I'd use it as the test card.
You're mean.
That's how he sharpens his beak.
Careful!
Stop it, you two.
-Carry on.
-Oh, all right.
Looks like someone shit in the sea.
That reminds me of my childhood at the lake.
I'm swimming along and see a floating turd.
When I came up I had a pile of shit on my head.
-Sleep well.
-Bye.
-Close the window, it's cold.
-I'll drive.
-I'll drive.
-No, I'll drive.
-You've had too much.
-I can drive.
-Katrin!
-Yes?
-I'll call you to make a date.
-Fine.
I could pick you up or something.
Bye.
Wave goodbye.
Time for beddy-byes.
Yes.
-She can really get on your nerves.
-Yes, she's unbearable at times.
-She never stops talking!
-I know.
-I think she's unhappy with him.
-Oh, I don't know.
-That was horrible of you.
-What?
Showing the picture.
-What picture?
-That awful one of me.
I was embarrassed.
-I thought...
-Can't hear you.
I thought it was mean.
That was really rotten of you.
It wasn't exactly flattering.
And then you leave...
What's that in your hair?
Then you leave it on the screen for ages.
You know how I hate that.
Stop it now.
It's embarrassing.
I mean, when we're alone...
When we're alone I don't mind but not when we have guests over.
-There's no need for that.
-Some of mine were terrible too.
-Did you see those?
-What do you want me to say?
I've found another shot.
-Down the hatch!
-I mean a slide.
Look at all the ash.
I wish you'd use this properly. You've got to tip the ash inside.
Oh shit!
Shit, shit, shit!

I don't mind though.
But it makes it difficult to spend time with the family.
You shouldn't be filming this.
I'm not supposed to smoke in here.
If the health inspector turns up I'm in trouble.
I'll have to pay a 20 mark fine.
-20 marks?
-Yes.
-Seriously?
-Yes, 20.
What happened, Uwe?
Oh shit, I don't believe it.
That's all I need.
-I'm sorry.
-We were supposed to meet.
-There's not much time.
-We're really busy.
-My break doesn't last forever.
-All right!
-Look at how full this place is.
-I'm so thirsty!
-Eberhard?
-Yes?
-Got half an hour?
-Yes.
Can you fill in?
We're buying a kitchen.
Hello.
-We want to look at some kitchens.
-Fine, go ahead.
Could you make a hamburger?
-It's almost ready.
-Okay.
My break is almost over.
We have to hurry.
I'd like to know why we're looking at kitchens anyway.
Oh, come on. You always put a damper on things.
-You've seen our place.
-And our kitchen.
There's no room for a proper kitchen.
There's space even in the smallest place.
You always spoil it.
I've lost interest.
I see it as a living area. A social area if you like.
In today's houses kitchens tend to be bigger.
When I read this crap I'm glad they didn't take me.
Can I take the car tomorrow?
No.
Did you drop something?
The glass from Aunt Trude.
Shit.
You married a klutz.
-Do you want some red wine?
-No.
That'll be Julia.
-So you decided...
-Hi.
Were you just going to bed?
Come in.
This is Jens.
This is my father.
Could you take your shoes off?
-Hello.
-That's Katrin.
Jens.
I've got something for you.
A letter from mum.
-Who's Jens?
-My boyfriend.
-I bought your cheese.
-You didn't say he was coming.
I said I was coming so I figured...
-Ask first.
-I didn't think you'd mind.
Are we running a cheap hotel?
Who will she bring along tomorrow?
-So you're Jens?
-Yes.
And what do you do?
That's my dessert.
The dessert stays here.
I said the dessert stays.
Make yourself a sandwich.
Well, have a nice evening, Jens.
-What is it?
-Stressing about the dessert.
Jens.
We'll be seeing more of Jens.
Sleep well.
You too.

Good morning.
Yuck, that is so gross.
What the hell is going on here?
We'll all go deaf soon at this rate.
Holy cow!
Are you losing it?
-Uwe!
-Is this an open-air concert?
Uwe, please come here.
Uwe!
-Ellen, come here.
-Uwe, you come here.
Ellen, come here, please.
Please come here.
Uwe, the raw meat in the bathtub.
-What did I tell you?
-It's gross.
Notice anything? Anything different?
Where's the bird?
-Hans-Peter!
-Mascha, oh God, Mascha!
-Explain that to the kids.
-Hans-Peter!
Hans-Peter!
-Hans-Peter!
-Maybe outside.
He's not in here.
-Oh God, no!
-Leave it open.
He might come back.
Uwe!
Be quiet.
I think I hear...
Where do we start?
I heard something here. -Hans-Peter!
-Well, he's not here.
-Do they fly very far?
-Why did you leave the door open?
-Maybe he's on one of the balconies.
-That was pretty stupid.
-I had to air the flat.
-So it's my fault.
-It's always my fault.
-It just gets so smoky.
-I know, we need an extractor hood!
-Exactly!
It's been a problem for weeks.
Now you blame me for airing.
Well, that's just great!
Why do I bother anyway?
Shit.
-I've got to go to work too.
-I'm sorry.
Let's have a look around the corner.
