BERLIN July, 1945.
Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin are scheduled to meet outside the city, in Potsdam, to draw the post-war map.
Only Japan continues to fight...
- Congressman.
- General.
Herzlich Willkommen in Berlin.
Who is that guy?
It's Breimer.
He's a congressman.
- You're here for the peace conference?
- To write about it.
- You ever hear of The New Republic?
The uniform is the Army's idea of a joke.
You see any action?
I was in London when Franz Bettmann aimed his Roman candles about a hundred feet away from me.
Broke all my martini glasses.
Who is Franz Bettmann?
Bettmann, Von Braun.
The Kraut brain trust, the guys who built the V-2s.
I actually wrote a column about it.
I wish I could write.
I have some great stories I could tell.
No sense beating up on the Germans.
The Russians are the enemy now.
They're godless people.
Go down to the railyard and see for yourself.
Anything's not nailed down, they're taking it, sending it to Moscow. Well, why not?
They took most of the bullets.
We've been teaching the ivans to play ball.
Some of those fellas can really hit.
I bet you can't wait to go home, huh, soldier? Yes, sir.
You know the Germans. They make excellent Danish but they can't bake apple pie like my mom.
Nothing wrong with the Germans.
Plenty of good German folk back in Schenectady.
Oh, excuse me. Let me help you with that, sir.
I got it, Tully.
- Being helpful is all.
- You know who's driving me tomorrow? Got my trip ticket.
I'm your driver for the duration of your stay in Berlin.
And I got you a little housewarming present.
- See you in the morning.
I wouldn't myself have sized him up that way, you know?
Just meeting the guy you wouldn't think of him as a patsy. That's what I loved about Berlin:
Even a guy who wasn't a patsy back home turned into one.
It was inevitable.
The city spread its legs.
All that "eat, drink and be merry" bullshit, "seize the day." It sure didn't make anyone smarter.
And the best part of it was no one got hurt.
There was too much money around for anybody to fall without a nice soft cushion.
Occupation marks printed just for us.
Funny money.
It didn't feel like losing it when they lost it.
The Russians, they had to spend it before they went home.
Which was all anyone talked about: Going home.
Everyone, even the Russians.
God, who would ever want to?
Say what you want about the war. I would never wish for all those millions of people to die but the war was the best thing that ever happened to me.
When you have money, then, for the first time in your life you understand it, what money does for you.
Where before all you understood was not having it.
Money allows you to be who you truly are.
So you like your job?
Your job.
Sure.
What are you doing with that cigarette?
Waste not, want not.
It is a job, right?
How do you like your job?
How do you like working in the motor pool?
What the hell does that mean?
- Nothing.
- That doesn't even follow.
Perhaps my English.
Like you should be fucking Dwight Eisenhower, Countess Roundheels?
- I was making conversation. - No, you weren't.
That's what I was doing.
Don't tell me my business.
Two thousand yards of silk in the Russian zone. I get in and out anywhere.
The British zone, the French.
I got the vehicle.
The motor pool's the best job in the fucking Army!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to help me get out of Germany.
It's gonna get harder, not easier.
Watch.
They put your name on a list, and then that's it.
I forget sometimes what a boy you are.
Such a boy.
- A sweet little boy. - No, cut it out.
Does that bother you?
Why should it?
My husband was a boy too.
A little boy who saw numbers in his head.
I'm your fellow, okay?
I'll get you out of here.
You watch.
My gill, she's not just a pretty face, no, sir.
She won first prize last year with her rhubarb pie, and second with her gourds.
- That's terrific, Tully.
- Oh, she's pretty terrific, sir.
Any luck, I'll be home for the harvest dance.
Well, at this rate we'll still be driving to Potsdam.
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed.
- Some son of a bitch stole my wallet.
- No kidding.
It must have been in that crowd at the airport.
I can loan you money if you need it.
Don't want you to miss all the great things Berlin has to offer.
I used to live here before the war.
- Ran the AP bureau.
They're not really gonna put the country on trial, are they?
Do you think they shouldn't?
Doesn't seem American to lock a person up for something they didn't have anything to do with.
Somebody you know, Tully?
I'm just saying.
Well, there's a piece that would sell:
"Fallen Women of the Third Reich."
That's pretty raw, sir.
Millions of people didn't disappear because the elves came out at night.
Your Fräulein knew exactly what Hitler was doing.
They all knew.
- Did she lift a finger?
- You don't know a thing about her.
And you do?
Just because you're a German doesn't make you a Nazi.
You heard Breimer.
It's on to the Russians.
The next war.
They'll leave your girlfriend alone unless there's some special reason not to.
It's gonna cost me to get her out of Germany I can tell you that right now.
I wish I could help you out, kid.
You want an hour with her?
Beautiful day, huh?
Are you looking for an argument?
I'm sorry I broke your tooth.
It was an honest disagreement.
What do you need? Papers.
To get someone out of Germany.
- A Nazi? - Not a Nazi.
A friend of mine.
With what I've been through, you'd ask me to help a Nazi escape Germany?
Hey, cry me a river.
Fuck, everyone in this town's got a hard-luck story.
You gonna help me or not?
I'll see what I can do. Great.
Just don't Jew me on the price.
- Where's Emil Brandt?
- Who the fuck is Emil Brandt?
- Fuck you!
Who's Emil Brandt? - Emil?
- Who is he?
They were looking for him in your place, Lena.
Where is he?
- He's dead. - Don't lie to me!
He died.
He died in the war.
Like you fucking know! Who is he?
He was my husband.
- Emil Brandt.
That's your husband?
I'm Lena Brandt.
- A last name. What a cozy feeling.
- Tully...
He must have done something if they're hopped up to find him.
I'm gonna find out sooner or later!
He was a mathematician.
He saw numbers in his head? It's bullshit!
They broke my fucking arm!
He was a nobody.
- Somebody's secretary.
- Whose secretary?
What does it matter who?
My husband brought him his coffee and took steno.
When's the last time you saw him? Three...
Three years ago.
I'm with you now, Tully.
How am I supposed to help you, Lena, if you won't help me?
I would never hurt you, Tully.
Never.
You can get anything on the black market.
I talked to someone.
A little lop-cock, no legs but he can run down anything.
He can get you on a train out.
That's what you want, right?
They told me he was dead.
One more dead, or not dead.
Who would know?
Poor, fucking stupid Lena.
You don't know fucking nothing, do you?
Hey, Sikorsky.
What happened to your arm?
Scotch from Scotland. Forty cases.
Good?
They flew it in for Churchill.
Can't afford it.
Hey, who's your comrade? Don't worry, I'll give you a price.
I got something else for you.
Really?
What's that?
Emil Brandt.
Remind me who that is.
You should know. You've been looking for him.
Have I?
Names, names, so many names.
Maybe I should just turn him over to the Americans.
Why don't you?
Because when everyone else pulls up their tents you ivans will be the only game in Berlin, and the fact is I like it here.
- That's it?
A favor?
Two hundred thousand marks.
It's not like I'm asking for real money.
Have the printing press work overtime.
Plus papers, so I can get my girlfriend on a train out of here.
The trouble is, Tully I have seen Emil Brandt's death certificate with my own eyes.
I thought you weren't looking for him.
Now, let me do you a favor.
You remind me of my son, a little bit of a buffoon, but good-natured.
Get out. Now. Before you get hurt.
Suit yourself.
I just gotta figure out how to get my girlfriend on that train.
What's your girlfriend's name?
Mrs. Emil Brandt.
Imagine her surprise when he turned up like that.
And mine too.
Hey, Tully.
I'll take your offer.
Two hundred thousand marks.
A lot to arrange, getting him out of the American zone. You follow?
Come back in two hours. I'll advance you half.
And bring Mrs. Brandt.
I'm not going with you to the Russian zone.
Lena, half up front, 100,000 marks.
Have you checked the exchange rate lately?
What happens when they find out you don't have Emil?
What happens is, we're in London with 10,000 fucking dollars.
You're out, I'm out. It's a perfect plan.
I won't go to the Russian zone.
He just wants to see you. What's the big deal?
He wants to know I have him.
- But you don't have him.
- You're out selling love you don't have.
Hey, fish.
I had to hitch a ride from the conference.
What happened? Blow.
I hate to pull rank on you, but you are my fucking driver.
I'm off the clock, sir.
I'm off the clock too.
I'll pick you up in the morning.
I'm in the middle of something.
- We know each other.
- I'm in the middle of something.
- What happened to you?
- I need a minute to think, Tully.
You can think on the way.
- Hey, don't push her around like that.
Move!
Get in.
Stupid fuck!
They gave me a choice:
London or Berlin.
For me there was no choice.
The minute it came over the wire that the war in Europe was finally over all I thought of was Lena.
I didn't expect to run into her. Not that way.
Not my first week in town.
But that was just like Lena.
She always kept me off balance.
Tully wouldn't be a problem, or not anything I couldn't figure out.
I just had to find her again.
I knew the bartender would help.
Tell a bartender you're looking for a friend, and you have two friends:
Him, and the girl he steers you to.
- What the hell is she doing with him? - Who?
- Tully?
He's not a bad sort. Just a bit of a cunt.
Yesterday he tried to pimp her to me.
Well, she and her friend Hannelore come around and cheer up the GIs.
We're all trying to get by.
This whole goddamn country, she winds up fucking my fucking driver.
Oh, you knew her?
I hired her as a stringer.
Her husband was never home.
There were no kids.
She got tired of rattling around the house all day.
She was good at it too.
She could get people to do things, and they didn't know how she did it.
- You were screwing your secretary. - Stringer.
Sorry.
What the hell does it mean she's with him, anyway?
She seems to have made quite an impression on you.
I just didn't expect I'd find her like this.
I didn't expect I'd find her.
When you say to yourself, "That's the worst thing I've ever heard" stick around.
That's Berlin.
Now it is.
There's always something worse.
- Geismer. G-E-I-S-M-E-R.
- Yes, yes, I understand.
I'm sorry, The New Republic is not credentialed for today's schedule.
- We can't have you without a press card. - I told you my wallet was stolen.
I have a line of people behind you.
You should speak to General Sikorsky. He's in charge of security.
Where's Charlie Ross?
I played poker with him in St. Louis.
If I could just talk to Charlie Ross.
Oh, fuck a duck.
General, I'm with the office of the military governor.
I'll be escorting the captain back to the American zone.
Were you with Corporal Tully last night?
I was in a club up till dawn drinking with the bartender if your girl Friday had bothered to check.
Checkpoint recorded Jacob Geismer crossing into the Russian zone just after midnight.
- Fucking Tully. - What's that? My wallet was stolen at the airport.
- Did you report it?
- It's not exactly a war crime.
Where did you get those bruises?
I got in a fight with Tully.
- Over...?
- He rode the brake.
Wasn't over a girl, was it?
He was supposed to pick me up.
He didn't show. I got pissy about it.
The Russians want this to go away.
An American serviceman turns up dead in Potsdam on the eve of the peace conference?
It's pretty damn embarrassing.
Good news for you, frankly.
We want it to go away too.
Well, maybe I should talk directly to the MG.
He won't wanna bother with this.
He doesn't wanna know what Tully was doing in Potsdam?
We're doing a hell of a job in Berlin.
Is there a black market? Sure there is.
Are some of our boys involved in it?
Yes, they are.
- Lf the Russians killed Tully...
- Then he deserved whatever he got.
And his poor family doesn't need to know anything more than that he crashed his jeep trying to avoid a bunny rabbit.
We're not gonna start World War III over some dumb GI who got his dick stuck in a pitchpot.
You stay out of the Russian sector for the rest of your time here.
Now, we can't protect you over there.
And if you find that girl we'd like to talk to her.
Kids.
Two months ago, they were shooting at us.
If it isn't Jake Geismer.
Who did you insult this time?
- You got a second?
I'll tell you.
- Yeah, why don't we catch up? - How's 1946?
- You mean you're not interested?
I know you, Jake. We're a long way from South Street.
That's funny. I haven't met a DA yet that could resist a murder.
Nothing better for a prosecutor than a criminal with a sense of history.
Everything got written down.
Who they killed and what it cost.
Meticulous record keepers.
- Forces from the west are poised to strike the final blows upon Japan.
This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied nations to prosecute the war against Japan until she ceases to exist.
- It looks like you're putting the whole country on trial.
- These are just the active cases.
The rest are kept under lock and key at Kransberg.
They want me to decide who the ardent Nazis were.
Truth is, it was the whole country.
Nobody's hands are clean.
Twenty-hour days just to get my arms around it.
So, what's the murder you wanted to tell me about?
What, Gunther?
He used to be a cop here in Berlin.
Don't worry, he doesn't speak a word of English.
My driver, a kid named Tully, turned up dead in Potsdam. Potsdam?
Potsdam's closed for the conference.
Whoever wanted him dead had access to the delegations. - That's somebody high up.
- Why haven't I heard about it?
Muller didn't want you to.
He ordered me to leave it alone.
Nobody around here's acting like the war is over.
Not the Russians. Not the MG.
- What's your angle? - Why should I have an angle?
It just doesn't sound like you.
You came home, all you talked about was what a great lay your secretary was.
- Stringer.
- Stringer. Sorry.
A bullet through the chest, in the river. It's like it never happened.
Isn't that what we fought a war about?
Even a louse like Tully?
The Russians will have to do a police report.
Can you get me a copy?
This guy drove one of the gas vans.
They would load the Jews in back, run the exhaust inside.
By the time they got where they were going, they were dead.
Very efficient.
Driving to work he killed more people than Al Capone in all his years.
But if you asked him, he isn't a murderer, he's a truck driver.
And he still thinks that.
Thanks, Bernie.
I owe you one.
Thank you, Danny.
I can't be out after curfew.
Would you walk with me?
You live here with someone?
Big man.
You want two girls?
You know a girl named Lena?
Who told you about Lena?
I'm not trying to get something for nothing.
Aren't you going to offer me a cigarette?
I didn't see her at the club.
Skinny Lena.
A big Yank in the saddle, you'd break her in two.
Can I look in your bedroom?
Good. An old-fashioned one.
Fuck in the bed. Easy on the knees.
Come. Fuck me, Dutch.
The princess, who knows where she is?
Lena was raped by the Russians.
You'll get yourself a good dose.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
She's not so special.
They raped everyone:
Cripples, children.
How did you find this place?
Five hundred just to talk.
That's what I call a real pervert.
Take a couple hours off, would you?
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I didn't say you did.
- The war, it's convenient.
We can all blame everything on the war.
Isn't that why you left?
The war?
I found that blue dress I bought you.
All the old things.
All the old times.
This is my life now.
Tully at least understood that.
What was Tully doing in Potsdam last night?
- I don't know. - You weren't with him?
Potsdam is in the Russian zone.
I don't go to the Russian zone.
Lena, if I can find you, so can they.
As if I'm the only one who needed help. - Look at you.
- What is it you're not telling me?
It couldn't be that I loved him?
You don't need to be afraid of him anymore.
You don't need to protect him anymore.
I think if you hadn't left, Jacob nothing would be any different.
Nothing.
Lf.
If you want to stay, it's 500 marks.
Make up your mind.
I'm going to sleep.
Did you get the report?
I had to get it from a friend of mine.
Even Muller hasn't seen that yet.
- Interesting reading?
- They found 50,000 marks on him.
So figuring they stole half, 100?
They found a slug lodged in his backpack, .32 caliber.
Our guns are .45.
Thanks.
Now, listen, I'm the first to recognize there were excesses in the Nazi leadership.
But if we besmirch an entire people because of a few bad apples we're no better than Hitler.
Then it's not about war crimes at all.
It's about revenge.
Revenge.
Right.
Exactly.
Revenge.
I found that in the dirt where Tully's body washed up.
The little dash that you'll sometimes find near the serial number? It's not there.
- That's meaningful?
- It means Tully had something to sell.
Something that our side badly wanted and you very badly didn't want us to have.
You solved it the way Russians know how to:
You put a bullet in him.
In Potsdam. Where he thought he'd be safe.
All that from a mark of punctuation.
No dash means that it's American.
You could check it against the money you stole from him if you felt like it.
I was expecting Tully that night.
Here. Not in Potsdam.
He never showed up.
Instead of the usual Scotch and cameras, he was selling for the price of 200,000 marks, a man named Emil Brandt.
What's so interesting about Emil Brandt?
The Americans were looking for him.
That made me curious.
We pack up entire factories and ship them back to Moscow.
Now the peace conference Poland, Romania, half of Europe, a windfall.
Something for the sacrifice and suffering.
Now ask yourself:
What do the Americans get?
Sounds to me like we're getting a good fleecing.
You may not be as safe on the American side as you think.
Hannelore, Lena.
Even radar couldn't find you here.
Of course, you won't be earning but Jacob here volunteered to carry you girls on the cuff till things have settled down.
I'll check in on you when I can.
As long as it's on the cuff and not on my back.
He gives me the creeps.
Fixing your mouth, with where it's going, sweetheart?
Let's give them a minute.
I don't want you to go out anymore.
It's a good thing I wasn't there, don't you think?
- I went for a loaf of bread.
- I can bring you anything you need.
Stare at the same four walls. I'd go mad.
You wanna tell me why Emil would be worth 100,000 marks to someone?
There'd be no reason.
That's how much money they found on Tully's body.
That doesn't make any sense.
Might have been nice to know, Mrs. Brandt that Tully was auctioning off your husband.
We never talked about Emil, remember?
One of our rules.
An affair has more rules than marriage.
The Americans are looking for him, and the Russians.
Why?
- I don't know. - Where is he, Lena?
Where's Emil?
Emil's dead.
He died six months ago in the bombing.
Tully found out the Americans were looking for Emil so he offered him to the Russians.
One of his schemes.
Stupid.
A way to get money to get me out of Germany.
Sell them a dead man.
Now he's dead too.
Maybe you next, if you don't watch yourself.
This isn't gonna go away because Tully's dead.
- That's all I know.
- Emil was with the SS?
Two years ago they all got uniforms. - Who knows why?
- Stop lying to me.
I'm a Nazi myself, did you know that?
- You're not a Nazi. - No, not a Nazi.
None of us.
Just something to join, like a sport club.
How could you fuck someone for all those years and not know them? - Stop it.
- Did you ever fuck a Nazi?
- How about a Jew?
- Why won't you let me help you?
- A Nazi and a Jew both, better yet.
- You did nothing wrong!
- I survived.
What happened to the rest of your family?
They got sent to the camps.
Everyone.
My mother, uncles, cousins.
Everyone dead.
As the wife of an SS man I was exempt.
"A Jewess is not a Jew," that's the way they used to put it.
It's not something I have ever told anyone.
And at the end no one was exempt.
Hannelore told me that you were raped by a Russian?
Hannelore can't tell a joke.
- I didn't realize it was funny.
- Hannelore's funny.
- She always leaves something out.
What did she leave out?
And then I met Tully.
God in heaven, I never thought I'd eat real ham again.
Aren't you gonna have any?
Is that a Jewish name, Jacob?
The way you're eating that ham could turn anyone kosher.
It's easy now to say Hitler was wrong about the Jews.
Let me tell you something. Nobody said he was wrong at the time.
You're up early.
I went down to the PX first thing and stocked up.
Do you want some coffee?
Real coffee.
No wonder you won the war, eating like this.
The little girl in the photograph, is that Dora?
The notebook said "Dora."
What do you think you'll find in here?
It's all I have left of him.
Very dramatic, the princess.
Don't believe her.
She didn't give two shits for him, alive or dead.
Dragging around that shrine of crap and papers.
Meanwhile, fucking with you the whole time before the war.
She'd make you a good wife, Lena.
She knows all the tricks.
Jake, come on into my office.
It takes two MPs to invite a friend over?
No wonder you don't get many dates.
You haven't been home the last couple of nights.
- Keeping tabs on me, Bernie?
- Those are classified.
I can keep a secret.
What the hell happened between you and Sikorsky?
Who's asking, you or Muller? Don't be stupid.
Muller thought I should arrest you.
Like you just did?
What happened to your ear?
Sikorsky says it's safer for me on the Russian side than on ours.
- I'm starting to think he's right.
- What else did Sikorsky say?
Come on, I show up in Berlin, and the driver assigned to me is running around with my old girlfriend?
That's a coincidence.
I knew it was a mistake to try to help you.
You put me in a car with Tully because you want Emil Brandt.
- Why?
- My apologies, Jake.
But I'm spending my days trying to find Adolf Eichmann not filling out trip tickets.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You look like shit.
Thanks for coming in.
- Can I help you, sir?
I need a trip ticket.
That's form 48.
Now, if I wanted to request a specific driver...?
- The same form.
Just fill in the name.
- It's a fella I used a few days ago.
Could you pull that trip ticket?
- What's your name, sir?
- Geismer.
Do you know Emil Brandt?
I knew him from Dora.
Who's Dora?
Why are they looking for Emil Brandt?
Champagne from the cellar of Admiral Dönitz. Care for some?
- I wouldn't want it to go to waste.
- Size of the bubbles. Smaller the better, that's the key to champagne.
This time last year I was in Anzio, up to my balls in mud.
Six months ago I was freezing my ass off in the Ardennes.
The good old days. When you could tell who the bad guy was by who was shooting at you.
Something on your mind?
You're hiding someone in a safe house in Kreuzberg. Who is it?
Lieutenant Schaeffer should be more careful about who follows him.
I wouldn't blame Schaeffer.
His name was on the trip ticket.
It could be I'm just a very attentive host.
Either that, or you thought I could lead you to Emil Brandt.
What do you think this peace conference is really about, who gets Poland?
The future.
That's why everyone's come to Potsdam.
What do the next hundred years look like?
All those V-2 rockets that hit London during the war.
Well, you were there.
If it lasted another year, that would have been New York Chicago.
- What's this got to do with the peace conference?
I thought you might have recognized him.
Our friend in the safe house is Franz Bettmann.
The Russians get Poland and we get the brains.
- In a perfect world doesn't a man like Franz Bettmann wind up building rockets for our side?
But it's not a perfect world.
It doesn't surprise you that there are those who don't wish America well, does it?
And Emil Brandt?
Brandt was Bettmann's secretary. Like a son to him.
Bettmann wants to bring him along to America.
Awfully sentimental.
Hundred thousand marks for somebody's secretary?
All of them.
As many as we can track down.
Split-level with a Ford in the garage. Kids in the back yard playing in the sprinklers.
Strange if you wanted anything different.
Wives too.
I wouldn't put too much stock in that SS stuff.
When I was at West Point, we put a uniform on a mule.
Now that the war is over, you can sail boats all summer.
Until curfew.
What do you do with the boats?
You go and find them?
On my bicycle.
How far do they go?
Far.
You don't lose them?
There's a place where the river eddies... in Potsdam.
Look at these sleeves and all this ruching.
Nobody wears anything like this anymore.
I thought we weren't gonna reminisce.
Your rules.
Not that we'd have time.
- Why? What's going on?
- Why didn't you tell me Emil was with the rocket program?
- I didn't think it mattered.
He worked directly under Bettmann and it didn't matter?
- Who told you about Bettmann?
- Muller.
They graduated from the same polytechnic. That's why Bettmann hired him.
Why did you talk to Muller?
He has Bettmann in a safe house, on his way to America to make rockets.
That's why they're looking for Emil.
They're all going, including the wives.
Why didn't you tell me, Lena?
- You know what Bettmann did. - Everybody knows who he is.
He was famous before the war.
Now, you can either tell me or Bernie.
- He'll be here in two minutes.
What was Tully selling that was worth so much money?
Some rocket secret? - No.
- How the rockets were built.
- Is that what's in here? How they were built?
A factory inside a mountain.
Tunnels where the American bombs couldn't reach.
What were once sulfur mines.
Someone had to take them out.
Slave labor.
Prisoners, detainees.
That was how they built the rockets.
Emil was asked to calculate how much to feed them to keep them alive just three months until the tunnels were completed.
It's here, in his notebooks.
Eight hundred calories a day.
After that, let them die and bring in new workers.
The correct answer, it turned out.
It was more efficient.
They called it Dora.
Camp Dora.
Thirty thousand died in that camp.
Bettmann ran it.
Every detail.
He hanged people from a crane right outside his office window.
Take the back stairs.
Find Danny and tell him we have to move again.
Make sure he knows where I can find you.
She's playing you, Jake.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Muller paid Tully 100,000 marks for Emil Brandt because he worked for the rocket program.
One big happy family.
They're all coming over to our side now.
Muller's hiding Franz Bettmann in a safe house.
Of course he is.
The Russians want them worse than we do.
- They're kidnapping them.
- Not from the Russians you dumb fucking cheesehead, he's hiding him from you.
They built the rockets in concentration camps.
Slave labor.
Bettmann ran it.
I don't wanna call your girlfriend a liar.
Let's just say I've met 12 people who swear on their mother they can deliver me Adolf Hitler if I'll cut them a deal.
Her husband was Bettmann's secretary.
I've seen the notebooks.
Be honest with yourself for a change, Jake.
Has anything good happened since you came back?
Can I help you?
A watch, perhaps?
- How about a cigarette case?
What happened to you?
An experiment to see if you can transplant a bone from one man into another.
It turns out you can't.
- Always something worse.
- You can get such stories anywhere.
I have plenty of those. The Russians trade them for Lugers.
- How about a camera?
Rolleiflex.
The old ones used to turn the image upside-down in the viewfinder.
Little mirror sets it right.
To set things right, a thing to wish for.
The woman who was just in here, what did she want?
Nothing.
She bought nothing.
I know her. Lena Brandt.
I know she was here for a reason.
Why?
Papers.
She wanted papers to get out of Germany.
A Persilschein, like the soap.
That's what they call it.
- To wash the sins away.
- Papers for who?
For herself.
What did she do that she has to wash away?
Better to ask why I would help her.
Me, with what I survived.
I wanna know.
At the Little White House in Potsdam Generalissimo Stalin of Russia is one of the first to welcome the president. As the meeting is recorded by Signal Corps and newsreel cameras.
Next to join the group is Prime Minister Churchill who meets an old conference friend.
The Big Three meetings are held in Kaiser Wilhelm 's former palace.
And President Truman is selected as chairman of the conference.
Here, the fate of Germany and the end of Japanese aggression will be settled.
Under the flag that flew over the White House when we declared war on the Axis, the president states our aims.
We are here today to raise the flag of victory over the capital of our greatest adversary.
Let's not forget that we are fighting for peace and for the welfare of mankind.
There's not one piece of territory, or one thing of a monetary nature that we want out of this war.
We want peace and prosperity for the world as a whole.
They have a file on her.
I thought Bernie's golem broke into her place looking for Emil, but it was Lena they were looking for.
That's why she had to get out.
Something she did during the war.
Tully wasn't killed in Potsdam, he was killed at Muller's.
The body floated with the current.
It didn't have to be someone with access to the conference. The Russian gun?
Get it at a pawnshop.
- It could have been anyone.
- Always something worse.
- Did she ask you? - What?
- To get her out of Berlin.
- She asked Tully.
You want my advice?
You'll forget all this.
You'll only get hurt here. Or hurt someone.
- Where is she, Danny? - Jake.
- Where are you going?
- I have someone to meet.
- Who?
- Stop following me.
- What about the curfew?
- Life is inconvenient sometimes.
- It's not safe.
- And always, it seems not safe. - Who?
- Someone who can get me out of Berlin.
- I'll go with you. - No.
Tully tried to get you out, now he's dead.
- Someone is waiting.
- Why is it so important for you to leave?
- What are you running away from?
You should never have come back to Berlin.
Why didn't Jake follow me?
Why didn't he try?
He was scared.
Scared I'd really do it.
That I'd shoot him just like Tully.
All these men they want you to cry in their arms.
I had no more tears.
I knew what I had become.
I had to kill Tully.
He was getting too close to the truth.
Which was that the only way out of Berlin for me was to do one thing good.
One thing noble.
Otherwise, Berlin would just follow me.
A wife should help her husband.
Isn't that noble?
Isn't that good?
Emil.
Does Geismer know I'm alive?
No.
Are you sure?
How can you be?
You need to eat something.
I'm losing my mind breathing the same air every day.
I need to take a walk. No.
Absolutely not.
Half an hour on the Friedrichstrasse.
They can't watch every moment...
The Americans have Bettmann.
The lies he'll tell it's absurd anyone would believe him.
"I'm Franz Bettmann... a world-famous man of science."
"Those terrible things that happened... it was the SS, I knew nothing."
People are thinking of themselves.
Why shouldn't you?
The world must know the truth.
That's the only way out for us.
We must answer for what we did.
Every one of us.
I promised I would help you.
And I will.
For the future.
For Germany.
Be patient.
I'm close.
How do you know you can trust Geismer?
He could get in the middle and ruin everything. Like Tully.
Then he'll end up like Tully.
I'll be candid. I'd think I'm the last person you'd wanna contact.
Sometimes people surprise you.
Then your husband is alive?
We're going to have to decide to trust each other, Mrs. Brandt.
To ask to meet me here in the Russian sector is not a good start.
I'm frightened.
That's not so difficult to understand.
When our GIs liberated Camp Dora, they found bodies stacked up in a room.
Stopped counting at a thousand.
That was the first thing they found.
There's nothing. Nothing to link Bettmann to any of it.
Not one sheet of paper, not one witness.
Your husband sat in on every single meeting and took notes.
If he were alive it would be extremely significant.
He's alive.
He's a good German.
He wants to tell the truth about Camp Dora.
What is it you want, Mrs. Brandt?
I want to get out of Berlin.
Without my husband.
Does he know that?
If I let you go, I'm part of the same hypocrisy as Muller.
But you'll do it.
Bring him in. Bring your husband in. We'll talk about it.
Why'd you leave the money on him?
Tully.
Did you panic?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You sure you wouldn't be better off staying put?
I'm nervous someone followed me here.
I'm close, Danny, really close to getting out.
That's when people get careless.
Because you can trust Jake, if that's who you're worried about.
Have you got somewhere you can put me?
I've got a Kino I bought in the French sector.
You know how they are about cinema.
Matinee only until the curfew's lifted, but it still turns a dollar.
After that, I'm fresh out of places to park you.
I'm going to need some money when I get to London.
You got a john for me? A rich one?
I've got a bloke in the club who'll give you a thousand marks.
Thinking about it?
When I met you, you'd have a go for a can of tuna.
Don't let me interrupt you.
A thousand marks.
That's the deal, isn't it?
You want it straight or something special?
What's special?
Whatever you want.
- How did Tully like it?
You going to take off your clothes?
You do it.
Forget it.
You keep the money.
I want to.
I would have gotten you out.
I still would.
You can never really get out of Berlin.
There's a parade tomorrow.
From the Brandenburg Gate all the way down the Wilhelmstrasse.
The checkpoints along the parade route will all be open.
You can walk straight through the Russian sector to Kreuzberg.
That's where he's meeting us.
Why does it have to be so complicated?
There is no direct route to the American sector from here.
It's either this or go through the British checkpoints.
They'd deliver you straight to Muller.
Look how many times I've moved and they've always found me.
What does that tell you?
And Captain Teitel himself will meet us in Kreuzberg?
I had to guess your size.
You've lost so much weight.
It was a good thing what you did.
To help me hide maybe to get caught yourself.
Not everyone would have.
What's he doing here?
I followed you.
It's a good thing too.
Go down to the Zoo Station.
Find Danny and wait there until I get enough money to get both of you out.
We can't trust him.
Pal, I'm the one sticking my neck out.
We're supposed to meet Hauptmann Teitel.
We should wait for Captain Teitel.
Do I have to draw a picture?
Someone got to him.
Even Bernie they got to.
Stand over there like you're waiting.
You answer the door.
Mrs. Brandt.
And this must be the famous...
Go!
Can you make it?
Go.
Help him.
How's your shoulder?
The nurses are very kind.
We were told that, if we found you, your husband would follow.
That he was devoted to you.
Now I understand why.
You're a lovely woman.
Remind me of the gals back home.
Schenectady.
You'd like it there.
Lots of good German folk.
The Sauerfleisch would make you forget Berlin.
Forgetting would be better than the Sauerfleisch.
Well, forgetting's a two-way street.
There are things you wanna forget and things we wanna forget.
Where are your husband's documents, Mrs. Brandt?
We can't seem to find them.
Oh, they're not with my other things?
You know they're not.
I don't know, I can't remember anything.
The medicine they've given me, it's making me feel all dizzy.
Most important thing right now is for you to get well.
- What the hell are you doing here?
It's after visiting hours, but I guess some people just can't follow the rules.
Leave her alone.
I came here to make sure she makes the right decision.
You really wanna push me?
I wouldn't.
You don't have those documents, do you, Jake?
You've seen what months of bombing can do to a city.
Imagine one bomb could do the same thing.
One bomb.
Stick it on the end of a rocket, press a button here, goes off over there.
Anywhere, halfway around the world.
That's the future.
The future of mankind's in our hands.
It's our destiny.
Hell, don't you read the papers?
- How'd you get in here?
- Who got to you?
Was it Muller?
- Do I need to call an MP?
- Not just yet.
What's "Overcast"?
- Who told you about Overcast?
- Is it a code name?
What's it got to do with Lena?
Come on, Bernie, trot out one of your atrocity stories to get me off your back.
I had nothing to do with what happened to Emil Brandt.
You're the only one that knew about me and Lena.
So what?
They got to me.
Least I got something for it.
I get to hang a half dozen Nazis they wanted to just send to jail.
Not like your girlfriend, though.
She got everything she wanted, didn't she?
She's good at that.
Well, you can tell your boy Gunther that he left one big, swinging loose end.
Lena doesn't have Emil's documents.
I do.
- Don't do it, Jake.
- I'll call you later for your quote.
You never saw Lena's file, did you?
You get me those documents or I'll put her in jail for the rest of her life.
I have everything I need and then some.
Don't think I won't do it.
If I give you those documents, then she leaves with me.
- Breimer's already taken care of that.
- Not with Bettmann.
With me.
Anyplace she wants to go.
Anyplace I wanna take her.
You've been wrong every step of the way, Jake.
Why stop now?
What's in her file, Bernie?
Why don't you ask her?
- You have your papers?
- They won't stop me.
I'm with you.
- Where are they?
- They're in my purse.
There's something wrong.
Why was it so important to get Emil out of Berlin?
And why does Bernie have a file on you?
He had a file on everyone.
I told you, I was the wife of an SS man.
Hitler put the rocket program under the SS two years ago.
That's what you told me.
That as the wife of an SS man, you were exempt.
That's true.
I told you the truth.
How many Jews were still in Germany in 1943?
By the time Emil could help you, you should have been deported or dead.
There were not so many.
You are right.
So when they caught me, I turned that to my advantage.
I used the skills you taught me.
When I worked for you, for the newspaper. Watch, observe.
The stupid risks they would take...
Lunch at Aschinger's...
Just to remind themselves they were still human.
I found 12.
I turned 12 people over to the Gestapo.
That's how I survived.
It was all to survive. Everything.
Now you know.
The last piece in your puzzle.
[ENGLISH]
Once, man and those in the water were linked.
They inspired us.
They spoke of the future.
Man listened and it became real.
But man does not listen very well.
Man's need to own everything led him deeper into land.
The magic world of the ones that live in the ocean and the world of men separated.
Through the centuries, their world, and all the inhabitants of it stopped trying.
The world of man became more violent.
War upon war played out, as there were no guides to listen to.
Now those in the water are trying again trying to reach us.
A handful of their precious young ones have been sent into the world of man.
They are brought in the dead of night to where man lives.
They need only be glimpsed and the awakening of man will happen.
But their enemies roam the land.
There are laws that are meant to keep the young ones safe but they are sent at great risk to their lives.
Many do not return.
Yet still they try try to help man.
But man may have forgotten how to listen.
My daughter says to be careful, Mr. Heep.
Well, it's some kind of a b... B... B...
It's very big.
It's very hairy.
My other daughter says it's some kind of creature the devil made.
Tell her it's not a creature.
There's no such thing as creatures, all right?
You...
You might wanna turn away.
Sorry this is taking so long.
It's over. It's over.
It's... It's safe.
My daughter says thank you for protecting them.
Mr. Farber?
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.
Mr. Heep!
You are new tenant?
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber.
He's in 13B.
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.
She's a student at the university.
Young-Soon, you don't know who's been swimming in the pool the last few nights, do you?
No, Mr. Heep.
By the way, here.
Thanks.
I liked it.
You're welcome.
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.
Could you wait here just a moment, please?
Gonna ask something.
Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?
Bubble parties, bubble bath, everyone skinny-dipping?
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
I'll trust you on that.
But something is making this water like this.
There has been someone swimming at nighttime.
I hear sp... Sp... Sp...
I left here yesterday afternoon, this filter was empty.
You kind of look like maybe you could work out a little bit, right?
I could give you a vein like that.
I could make it look just like this.
Most people say, "What's wrong with you, Reggie?
Why you only working out on one side of your body?"
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.
This morning I measured my bicep.
Four-and-a-half-inch difference from one side to the other.
Look at that.
Take a guess at the difference between my thighs.
Sorry. - Hey.
Me and the new guy, we're talking science.
Okay, that's great.
Here we go, Mr. F...
Here we go.
Come on.
Don't hang out in the stairwell, Reggie, please.
Just... People might trip.
All right.
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.
He's working out only one side of his body.
Did he...? Did he tell you that?
Hello, Mr. Leeds.
Those soldiers are only now beginning to wonder how long they'll end up staying.
If this does come to combat, we will not be in the battle for the sake of the battle.
He's been here f... F... Forever.
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady.
You'd like her.
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.
Axl Rose.
Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon...
Jon Bon Jovi.
What?
Are you...?
This is you.
There's no smoking inside.
And there's no swimming after 7.
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?
I've been hired to be the local film and book critic for the paper.
They flew you all the way out here for that?
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.
Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.
I smell something awful coming from the upstairs apartment.
I think someone may have died and the body is decomposing.
I know I said this last week, but...
Not everyone here spent Sunday practicing for war.
At Sunday church services, chaplains rallied the troops.
For these Marines, a moment for prayer at a service that many here believe will be their last before going to war.
U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy, estimated at 3 to 4000 may be willing... - a major... A major confrontation.
At the same time, the U.S. Military will be fighting a propaganda war.
If there were a silver bullet, we would've shot that a long time ago.
I saw you!
I saw you!
Come out of that pool right now!
I'm gonna wait.
Come on out, now.
It's... It's not safe.
Come on out.
This is not f...
This is not funny.
Please sto...
God.
Did you pull me out?
Where are you from?
The Blue World.
Is that an apartment?
Do you feel an awakening?
I'm sorry?
It will feel like pins and needles inside.
It is not you.
It's late.
You really...
You shouldn't be here.
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.
My name is Story.
I didn't mean for you to tell...
Why am I not stuttering?
What?
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.
"From the cliffs."
That is what your name means.
Where did you learn that?
From my studies.
I promise that I will not get you into trouble.
I am scared.
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.
Why are you scared?
You can wait here for a little bit until you feel not so scared.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God.
You're just a kid.
Hello.
Okay. It's time to go.
Story, come on.
I think you need some fresh air.
I'm just gonna take you outside. I'm gonna put you on one of the pool chairs.
I'm gonna get you some coffee and then you can wake up.
Then I'll walk you home.
Tell me, who in the world are you, anyway?
- Narf.
- What?
Come on.
Here we go.
It was sort of h... H... Hairy, but...
And it was kind of g... Green.
- You say green? - Yeah.
I thought so.
Matted is... Is not right.
It was f... F... Flat, and...
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.
It's obviously some dumb animal who muddled himself. About how tall?
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.
I mean, are there any w... W... Wolves in this area?
Hyenas?
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?
Sorry.
Something keeps setting off the sprinklers.
I'll look around the forest and check behind the dumpsters and stuff.
An animal that size, the one you're describing doesn't walk around and not be seen.
There's nowhere for a dumb big animal to hide.
Got a lot of homework, huh?
University gives many pages of reading.
What they think, I have no social life?
I got more books for you.
Could you look up the word "narf" for me?
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.
I do not remember it.
My great-grandmother used to tell it when she was alive.
Bedtime story?
What's the story?
I do not remember.
How about your mother?
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.
She wants to know who told you this word.
Just a friend. I don't...
I don't... I don't know her very well.
She said that her grandmother used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.
She said that she knew someone who knew someone who saw one.
Saw one what?
A narf, the bedtime story says, is a sea nymph.
I s... What... What happens in the story, please?
No.
Mrs...
In the bedtime story she must be seen by the one human chosen for her.
This person is called the vessel.
Seeing the narf will awaken something in the chosen one.
If she's successful in this she will return with the Great Eatlon, a giant eagle and become free.
She won't tell me more.
She said, why can't I be like my older sister. She married a dentist.
Story, could you put something back on, please?
Are you here to meet someone, see someone in this building?
Is somebody supposed to see you?
Is...?
It is a writer.
Do you know his name?
Do you know what he looks like?
Do you know if it's a...? A woman or a man?
Is there something that you wanna tell me?
Is this person writing something important?
When do you have to leave?
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.
I'm gonna help you get home.
Thank you, Cleveland.
I have to go.
Hello.
I... I...
I wanted to ask you something about your work.
Your c... C... Critic work.
How's it...
How's...
How's... How's it going?
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.
So you... You...
You haven't written anything yet?
Haven't written anything for some time.
You were right about that one tenant.
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.
We got along.
She's very good with animals.
You know she wrote a book?
Mr. Heep, I will be taking the cat in directly.
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.
Lookie here.
My, there's a lot of butterflies around this building.
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.
I understand that you're a writer, Mrs. Bell.
Now, where'd you hear such things?
Maybe I read your book.
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?
Mr. Farber has been speaking out of turn.
Look at this cereal character's picture, Dad.
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.
I need a nine-letter word for "in human form."
You'll figure it out, Dad.
You know, the color on this box look just like the colors of your car, Dad.
Maybe we should take your car and go visit Aunt Sylvia.
Incarnate.
Well, you're very good with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.
Are you... Are you writing anything, Mr. Dury?
A book, maybe?
No, I...
I'm afraid my skills are limited to crossword puzzles.
That's some serious reekage, man.
You don't even speak English anymore.
What, reekage?
Damn straight it's English.
The state of reek.
There's no "reekage," man.
Some toker just like us made it up somewhere, and here you are speaking it.
Let's make up a witty phrase. It'll become famous.
It needs to be on some T-shirt or something, you ass.
No, it doesn't. It just catches on. People just start saying it.
Blim-blam.
What?
Blim-blam?
Somebody already said that.
Gentlemen, I don't suppose any of you have written anything lately.
An essay or something?
Something important?
No essays here, my man.
Stop putting your clothes in the garbage disposal and stop smoking.
Baby's on the half-tip.
- Snap! - Yeah.
There you go. There you go.
Mr. Heep.
She told me a little bit more of the story before she throw cushion at me.
Young-Soon.
You're not writing anything, are you?
A p... P... P...
Writing?
No, Mr. Heep.
This semester all multiple-choice courses.
Young-Soon is not stupid.
She told me about a bad guy in story.
These creatures are called scrunts.
They are meant to kill a narf when she is out of the water.
They can lay completely flat.
Their back is covered in grass.
My great-grandmother said that's why man never sees them.
They will appear as a bump in the lawns.
Vick.
Anna.
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk is still not working.
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.
How long have you been writing, Vick?
Six months.
What?
I should finish, right?
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.
He'll do anything to get out of writing.
See this?
It's the third load of laundry he's done this week.
I can fix that light now, if you want.
A cookbook.
This has gotten s... S...
Silly.
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.
I fixed the light.
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep. Thank you.
You're both cooks?
Who, him?
He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.
Wait a minute, I don't understand something.
I'm sorry.
I ended up seeing the title of what it is you're writing.
It said The Cookbook.
I know, it's a bad title, right?
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts on all our cultural problems and thoughts on leaders and stuff.
I don't know who's gonna wanna publish the thing.
That is not how you fold.
Your thoughts are very sad.
Most are of one night.
A night a man entered your home when you were not there.
He stole many things and killed your wife and children.
That is when you stopped being happy.
You were a doctor.
I am very sorry for you.
You believe you have no purpose.
You help all that live here.
Anybody can do this job, Story.
You have a purpose.
All beings have a purpose.
I know who you are.
And I think that I've found your vessel.
You know what I'm talking about, right?
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone or does he just need to see you?
Cover yourself up.
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.
- I gave it to you on the stairs. - Okay.
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.
By the way, this is my friend, Story.
Yeah, you were right.
Here it is.
Great.
You all right?
You look a little...
I'm feeling a little funny.
It's nothing.
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?
Yeah, kind of.
Maybe you should go lie down.
Nice meeting you.
I'm so very happy we saw each other.
You don't have to leave right now, do you?
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.
Is that okay?
Your words are very beautiful.
Your heart is very big.
No one knows about my family here.
Please do not bring it up again.
Coming.
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik. It's...
It's been a long day.
Come on.
Listen, he's on the toilet. He's been having some gas issues.
Don't tell him I told you. I...
I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.
Don't tell him I told you.
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.
It's... It's... It's okay.
I should come when you call.
It's my job.
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?
There are laws.
It will be safe.
I'm allowed to leave this night.
- How long do you think?
- It is time.
You must not watch.
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?
I won't watch.
Thank you for letting me wear your beautiful shirt.
You keep it.
What happened?
Calm down.
Calm down.
How'd you get those scratches?
Did the eagle come?
Did something go wrong?
Story.
Story.
Was it that dog again?
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?
Mr. Heep is here.
He has a friend.
She's beautiful.
She's not feeling that well: So she's lying down in my room.
Why is she here? Why isn't she at his place?
Well, she got sick in the stairwell downstairs.
She's wearing no clothes under his shirt.
Blim-blam.
Mr. Heep is a player.
- I hope it's all right. - It's fine.
Do we need to take her to a hospital?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f...
F... F...
- Fine?
Thank you.
No, she just needs some rest.
She can stay here as long as she needs to.
You started writing again?
I'll be right back. Okay?
Hello. M...
Mrs. Choi, is Young-Soon at home?
No home.
Great.
Unbelievable.
Thanks.
- Where are you?
- At a club.
Don't tell my mother.
She thinks I'm at a dance class.
What happens if a narf gets scratched?
I don't know.
Put my mother on, I'll ask her.
Mrs... Mrs. Choi.
Thank you.
Oh, she... She... She...
She doesn't look happy.
She said the story her grandmother told said a scrunt has poison that kill narfs.
But she said narfs can protect themselves.
They are given a mud called Kii that cures them.
They keep it where they live.
All right. Now, you said that the eagle comes to take them back.
Now, what stops this green thing from attacking them when the eagle comes?
You're funny, Mr. Heep.
- Yeah, I know.
- You really thought about this.
Put my mom on.
She said only a rogue scrunt will break the law of that night because most scrunts are afraid.
Afraid of what?
Tartutic.
They are the law keepers in this bedtime story.
Her grandmother said there are three of them but they are called one name:
Tartutic.
They live in the trees.
They are said to look like monkeys.
No one knows for sure because no one who has seen them has lived.
The legend says that they were born so evil that they killed their parents on the night they were born.
The fear of them has kept justice in The Blue World for centuries.
Bye, Mr. Heep.
Thanks.
They are given a mud called Kii that cures them.
They keep it where they live.
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.
She tell me more of the story.
- Why you wet? - That's...
Apartment business.
Listen, Mr. Heep, my mother thinks of you as stranger.
You have to make her see you as a child, innocent.
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.
There is a reason the rules might be broken.
A Thousand Narfs is about a rare narf who comes once in a generation of narfs who is called the Madam Narf.
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.
But it is the Madam Narf herself that is truly the key.
She's considered a queen to her people.
Her return will be seen as a great inspiration.
A scrunt will do anything to kill a Madam Narf even forget his fears of the Tartutic.
He might break the rules for that, Mr. Heep.
Will she know that she's a Madam Narf?
No, that is moral of bedtime story.
No one is ever told who they are.
I think we are linked.
It's more than just a story to me too.
I actually want to believe it.
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.
You have saved my life again.
You made that room.
The cracks that I saw. Is that room supposed to collapse eventually?
I'm not allowed to speak of The Blue World.
Well, the door needs a little work.
I noticed that you took things from the apartment that people left around the pool.
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.
I think I might know why the scrunt needs to get you so bad.
Why did he break the rules tonight?
As it turns out, I think that you're someone very important to everyone.
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.
I trust you.
I believe you are here to protect me.
Is the Kii working?
Yes, thank you.
If it is true that I am... He will keep coming after me.
I will not be safe until...
Until Tartutic comes.
My mother said she saw a ghost once, in the basement.
I was the only one who believed her.
She's not an apparition, Anna.
I don't know who you are but you did something to me.
My thoughts.
Everything became clearer.
The fears that were muddling my thoughts just went away.
I can hear myself.
Do you wish to know your future?
A boy in the Midwest of this land will grow up in a home where your book will be on the shelf and spoken of often.
He will grow up with these ideas in his head.
He will grow into a great orator.
He will speak and his words will be heard throughout this land and throughout the world.
This boy will become leader of this country and begin a movement of great change.
He will speak of you and your words.
Your book will be the seeds of many of his great thoughts.
It will be the seeds of change.
The Cookbook?
Oh, jeez.
Could you tell her that I was interested in hearing more of the story?
Tell her it's a beautiful story.
Are there... Are there any parts that might be good to hear?
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.
Tell her I know that she is not allowed to tell about her world but maybe I could ask some questions, and she can just say if it's right or wrong.
Know what I did when I was little and me and my girlfriends would get in trouble? My mom always wanted to know what happened but I was like, "I can't tell on my friends."
So she came up with this way of me telling her things without talking.
She would say, " Touch your ear or something if the answer is yes."
So I would, and then she would know certain things but I didn't really feel like I told on my friends.
It was cheating, I know, but made me feel better.
We're ready.
So in this bedtime story the narf has come to a preordained place.
She must leave from the same spot.
This eagle, the Great Eatlon, coming to take her back is really very important.
And here's the good stuff.
There are humans with powers that can help her.
And these people have been unconsciously drawn to live near the vessel.
Now, these humans don't know who they are and they always appear in the story earlier.
Are there humans with powers that can help you but don't know who they are?
That's a yes!
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.
Ask her if that's right.
You want something.
One of them. Vick.
Mr. Heep.
Mr. Heep is one of them.
Which one?
Guild, Guardian?
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.
I was told that there's a Symbolist an interpreter who can read signs in clouds and other forms.
He will interpret messages from the universe if problems should arise.
Do you know who the Symbolist or Interpreter is?
That's a no.
And I was told that there is a Guild whose many hands will combine to help.
Does she know who they are?
There is a Guild or something.
They're supposed to help with their hands.
That's another no.
All right, there's one other.
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.
It's a human, usually a female so full of hope that they can awaken the life force in all things.
Now, that one is called the Healer.
And you can tell that they're in the story because butterflies are drawn to the Healer.
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.
You don't know any of these people, do you?
Reading?
A book?
Learning.
She thinks it has to be learned.
Is the eagle going to come back for her?
Only one last time.
Mr. Heep, you know the people in this building.
You have to find them.
What is it?
You know these walls are paper-thin?
I can hear all that bloody noise downstairs like they were in my kitchen.
Can you do anything about that?
Of course not.
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.
You're an expert on p... P... Plots, right?
You know who's gonna do what in a book or a movie even at the beginning, yes?
There is no originality left in the world, Mr. Heep.
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.
Well, if there was a mystery and a guy had to figure out who some people were like he had to find a symbol guy someone who can figure out messages and a guild of people who are going to be important at the end as a group.
How would you figure that out?
The symbol person should be simple.
Look for any character who is doing something mundane but required analysis.
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.
This picture on the cereal box is supposed to make you feel happy.
I feel sad, like that time you forgot to pick me up at school.
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?
Sure, Dad.
As for the guild look for any group of characters that are always seen together and have seemingly irrelevant and tedious dialogue that seems to regurgitate forever.
And you just sit around and talk about nothing?
Oh, we talk about serious issues.
On occasion.
We talked about Martin Luther King at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.
You talked about that?
This is the writer's way of establishing characters who will be important further in the story.
Is there anything further I can assist you with during my naptime? No.
No, Mr. Farber.
Thank you.
Story, these young men are the Guild.
And Mr. Dury...
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.
Story wants to go home and she can't.
Tomorrow night is her last chance.
Mr. Dury, please step forward.
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know.
It's only around her.
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what to do if something should go wrong.
He will use an instrument specific to him to interpret.
- Try it, Mr. Dury. - I don't...
Let's just see what happens.
I think that there's a message in there for us.
Well, nine letters across is the word "essential."
And it touches 27 down, which is "scheme."
- Essential scheme. - Yes.
Now, those were the first two words that I deciphered in this puzzle and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.
There's a word that seems out of place to me. - Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."
Soiree could mean "party." How could a...?
How does a party help us?
Well, I guess I thought that, you know a party is interesting because this thing out there is an animal and it probably has a very keen sense of smell.
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury.
Humans have a pungent smell to animals so I thought that maybe everyone gathered together would confuse him and he wouldn't be able to distinguish her from amongst all of us.
Does that sound right?
He's hearing the voice of God through a crossword puzzle.
- We're just playing here, right?
- No.
Wait, wait.
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon will land in the presence of beings not from its world.
She didn't want me to watch when the eagle came the first time.
That's before she knew that I was the Guardian.
Would I be able to watch now?
But there will be... There'll be hundreds of people at a party.
It won't work. It won't work.
See if there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.
This word did give me great difficulty, and then it came to me.
- "Sonorous."
It could mean music, a band.
Maybe we gather everyone inside at the last minute to hear a band and we who are of the world stay with her to help her with that thing and...
He's a prophet.
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.
No, I think that it worked. I think that it worked.
That is why they're the Guild.
I think they're supposed to use their hands to throw us a party.
- Is he serious? - We're gonna throw a party.
- Huge party.
We are serious. - Tell them...
Anything you can do for us, all right? Tables...
We definitely need a band. It's like the most important thing.
Oh, my God.
You don't think this is gonna work, do you?
I'm nervous too.
You being out there tomorrow night.
Me not knowing what to do as the Guardian.
Think I can go out there tonight and maybe face that thing without you?
Get a little practice with him?
Scare him, maybe?
Show him who's boss?
I know you wanna get home.
You will need a mirror.
Can you hear me?
I'm here.
Peer over your shoulder carefully.
It is only through a mirror that one can see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.
It will appear to you as two red spots in the darkness.
Yeah, I... I don't... I...
Wait.
I see him.
The Guardian has instincts of when the scrunt will attack.
He is a great weapon against him.
You should walk backwards towards him.
When you are close enough to be certain of his position turn and face the hidden scrunt.
I'm facing him.
I am scared.
It is about to get very dangerous.
I'm ready.
You must invoke the ancient words "Nef Ra Mora."
It is a command to rise and a challenge to fight.
What is happening?
He's rising out of the grass.
His legs are bending and coiling underneath him.
Oh, my God.
He's standing in front of me.
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.
If the Guardian looks directly into the scrunt's eyes it will be compelled to stay frozen or move backwards.
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction? Is he frightened?
I'm not sure.
- Look into his eyes.
- I am.
- Is he moving away? - No.
The Guardian can control his mind.
The J.G. Scrunt will not be able to attack.
- You must look into his eyes.
I think something's wrong.
He's stepping forward.
He's stepping forward?
Something's wrong!
Cleveland, run!
What is it you are doing?
Hey there.
Anything I can do for you there, Mr. F... F...
F...
So how was the m... Movie? - Sucked.
- Oh, what a...
What a shame.
Characters were walking around saying their thoughts out loud.
Who does that?
And a typical romance where the couple finally tell each other they love one another in the rain.
Why does everyone like to stand around and talk in the rain in movies?
Well, maybe...
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification, starting new.
No. It's not.
Are you okay?
He'll choose to move only when no one is looking.
They're masters of hiding.
A scrunt will hide unless he cannot hide in his environment.
If a tenant hadn't walked by I'd have been eaten alive.
I had no powers over him.
You are not the Guardian.
I do not understand.
I cannot protect you.
Where are the Tartutic?
Why isn't he being punished?
Where is the justice?
How come you don't ask about bedtime story anymore?
I've been busy.
You...
You coming to the party tonight?
I have to study.
Bye, Mr. Heep.
Mr. Leeds, did you hear about the p... Party?
You coming?
- A picture here of the enemy they're...
Does man deserve to be saved, Mr. Heep?
- What?
- Man.
That's not the answer I expected.
Why'd you a... Ask me that?
I know about your family.
I looked you up when you started working here.
I know someone killed them.
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.
I know.
You don't wanna become like me.
By the way, your invitation would sound more real if it had the guy's name on it.
There's something strange going on around this building.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
It is finished?
You can see things in the future?
Some things.
I have a question to ask you.
I will do my best to answer it.
You'll tell me the truth, right?
Change doesn't happen the way you say it's gonna happen without dramatic events that accelerate thinking.
I wrote this thing.
It might take decades or longer to create a reaction before it anchors in the consciousness.
That's not the type of change you're telling me is gonna happen, right?
I was wondering why he didn't meet me this leader who's just a boy.
If he was so inspired by my words, why didn't he try to meet me?
There's a lot of things in The Cookbook people won't like to hear.
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.
So I started thinking, "How is this gonna happen?
Why are people gonna suddenly take me seriously?
And why didn't he meet me?"
And I thought of how it could happen.
Story, I wanted to ask you, is something gonna happen to me?
Is someone gonna kill me because I write this?
Yes.
Man thinks they're each alone in this world.
It is not true.
You are all connected.
One act can one day affect all.
What are you guys whispering about?
Is he trying to get you to tell him how many kids he's gonna have?
I told him eight, all bratty boys.
I asked her if she knew the name of the deaf, dumb and blind guy that's gonna marry you.
Very funny, Herb.
Don't tell my sister.
Hi.
I'm Mr. Farber.
I wanted to thank you.
I was completely surprised by all of this.
I was expecting some kind of greeting, of course.
But this is beyond my expectations.
I'm 13B.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?
What's up?
- Oh, yeah.
Good for you.
I know of your future, Cleveland.
Do you wanna hear it?
Tell me what happens when the eagle takes you back.
It is only what I have been told by others.
They tell us the world will line up and reveal we are on the right path that the universe will give us signs.
The Tartutic could have not come yet.
I can still sense the scrunt's presence near.
You have to believe that this all makes sense somehow.
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.
I'm not special.
I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.
I don't know how to lead.
Do you get sick every time you break a rule? Every time that you tell me something that you shouldn't?
There's a storm coming.
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.
I do not have courage.
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.
You do what you think is right.
You are very brave.
You were always meant to lead, Story.
Cleveland the Great Eatlon is coming.
I'm glad you read my journal.
Don't worry.
We're all watching you.
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.
Do not leave this spot.
Find a mirror.
Why hasn't the m... Music started?
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.
You used up the battery.
Wave to him.
They told her that the universe would line up and reveal that we're on the right p... Path.
Why isn't this working?
Sometimes animals just look dead.
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.
It is not time for you to go.
It is not time for you to go.
Isn't this supposed to work?
Fourteen across.
I don't know.
I don't know.
This world is about finding your purpose, right?
And the only way to do that is to find your own voice. You told us that.
I don't feel like an Interpreter.
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?
I mean, I don't see anything in these words, and I didn't before.
And finding one's purpose is a profound thing.
Sometimes it isn't always what it seems.
What if these young men are not the Guild?
Look at what happened at the party.
These things haven't seemed right from the beginning.
Why are you so certain that I am the Interpreter and they are the Guild?
He was so sure.
What?
I asked someone.
He acted like he knew.
What kind of person would be so arrogant to presume to know the intention of another human being?
Who put this young girl's life in jeopardy?
Is the bathroom on this level working?
A dog inside the building.
Go.
Shoo!
Why, you're not a dog at all.
My God.
This is like a moment from a horror movie.
It is precisely the moment where the mutation or beast will attempt to kill an unlikable side character.
But in stories where there has been no prior cursing, nudity killing or death, such as in a family film the unlikable character will narrowly escape his encounter and be referenced again later in the story having learned valuable lessons.
He may even be given a humorous moment to allow the audience to feel good about him.
This is where I turn to run.
You will leap for me.
I will shut the door.
And you will land a fraction of a second too late.
Why would they lie to her about Tartutic?
These cannot just be fairy tales they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.
This has gotta be about faith.
Her world works by different rules than ours.
She may not be dead.
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.
How are we suddenly going to realize someone's purpose?
This is someone doing something ancient. An ancient thing in modern times.
It could be someone who sees purity in what we see as mundane. Sees the voice of God in the ordinary.
He is someone who sees meaning in the ordinary.
Does anyone have any idea who this is?
My God.
I do.
There is a message.
There is a ceremony to be done.
You're doing great, Joey.
The hands of the Guild will be needed, plus two others.
Joey, who is the Guild?
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.
Sisters?
The Guild is women?
They will touch together with their hearts as one to bring strength to the moment.
Nice, Joey.
You will need a man who has no secrets and one whose opinion is highly respected as witnesses.
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.
Mr. Perez de la Torre.
I need to speak with your f... F... F...
Honey? Honey, there's some people here to see you.
Sweetheart?
He's probably rinsing his mouth.
He's got terrible breath.
Don't tell him I told you.
- Huge explosions right in the very heart of the capital.
Several explosions, I felt at least four very close to the center of the city.
I think we have everybody.
A man who has no secrets and one whose opinion I greatly respect.
They will be w... W... Witnesses.
Will the Guild please come forward?
And you make seven.
Seven sisters.
Come, come.
Everything's right now.
Come back to us now.
Come back to us now, honey. Come back to us.
I can't believe it.
This is crazy.
This woman is probably dying as we're talking.
She needs to get to a hospital.
This is not right. We can't just stand here playing make-believe.
I wanted to believe more than most.
I wanna be like a child again.
I needed to believe there's more than this awfulness around us but at some point we have to stop.
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove some stories are real.
I read it wrong.
It was my first time.
I thought it said, "She will lead a ceremony of seven sisters to bring strength to the moment."
I looked at it again.
It says "he."
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters to bring strength to the moment."
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.
It said the Healer could be a man. But I...
But I... I saw a butterfly land right on her.
Butterflies?
Yeah, the bedtime story said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.
But, Mr. Heep, you brought that butterfly to me.
It caught my eye as you walked over.
I did?
Wait, no.
You must try.
- There's no time. - I can't.
I can't. I can't.
Shut up and try.
Say something to bring out your energy.
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.
I should have been there.
I am always gonna regret just not being there.
I'll miss your faces.
Oh, they remind me of God.
I'm so lost without you guys.
I met this very nice lady, and her name's Story.
And I think you would've liked her.
I think she might be an angel because she has to go home.
I love you all.
I love you all so much.
Thank you for all you have done.
Your sister will have seven children.
You will see the first two.
Oh, my God.
He's the Guardian.
Reggie! Reggie!
Reggie, just keep looking in his eyes!
Keep looking in his eyes!
Thank you for saving my life.
[ENGLISH]
Hey, sleepy head!
- You up?
- What time is it?
Almost noon.
I'm afraid you've got to go.
- Excuse me?
- You've got to go. I have friends coming over for brunch.
What?
In My apartment?
Sorry.
3 years and you still treat me like a one-night stand!
Babies!
Sorry, I'm late. I had to deal with James.
James? I thought you broke up with James.
I did. He's just not taking it very well.
What? All alone in his big, empty castle?
Be nice.
Anyway, I had to give his ego CPR.
How tiresome.
What did you say?
Oh you know, how great he is, how he's going to make the right girl so happy, how it's really not him, - it's blah blah blah...
- And he believed you?
Of course not!
So then I had to fuck him.
Right.
Where's Peter?
Babies, we missed you at brunch!
Sorry, I had to finish 1500 words for Empire.
- Talullah sends her love.
- How is she? In love! With this Jamaican model I set her up with.
Apparently, he shags her 4 times a day and inspires her to write volumes of new poetry!
- Isn't that great? - No, I hate Talullah's poetry.
Speaking of shags, how was your date with Doug?
- Fine.
- Fine? Just fine?
Look, Jacks! I really appreciate you trying to set me up with Doug
And Phil and John.
- What's wrong with Doug?
- Nothing, I just... I just don't see much of a future together.
How do you know that after one dinner?
Maybe because we have nothing in common?
That's not true. You're an artist, Doug's an artist.
Doug's a florist!
He's a horticultural designer.
Yeah, whose 'life goal' is to create a sculpture of Princess Diana entirely of bougainvillea.
You are such a snob!
I am not a snob!
I have hay fever. I'd be allergic to Doug's work.
Look, Doug deserves better than me.
You're never going to find anyone with that attitude.
What attitude? I'm just being realistic.
If you're realistic, then I'm the Queen of England.
I'm the Queen of England!
Hello, your Majesty!
Oh Daphne, you poor thing!
Of course, I'll deal with the shoot.
I can handle Sasha.
Lots of love, big kiss.
Since when do you say 'lots of love, big kiss' to your boss?
Since Daphne's going through a nasty divorce.
She needs positive affirmation.
Babies, what's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm just a little nervous. He's meant to have a ferocious temper.
Who?
Marvin Bernstein.
The man I'm interviewing today. Since when do you get nervous about celebrity profiles?
Since we're not talking about some two-bit British TV presenter.
Marvin Bernstein is a living legend!
The man's produced some of the best films in the last 20 years!
He's a giant among the film industry!
- A giant?
- Maybe I should call in sick.
Maybe that's what's bothering you.
That I'm not feeling well?
No, that Marvin Bernstein reminds you that these celebrity profiles are meant to pay the rent. While you're focusing on your screenplays.
Can we not talk about my nonexistent film career right now?
I'm feeling small enough as it is.
Babies? Just remember. Marvin Bernstein may be a giant.
But You are a giant in waiting. Yes, yes I am.
- I have no idea what that means.
- Neither do I.
I'm here to see Mr. Marvin Bernstein.
- Your name?
- Peter Simon.
Peter Simon. Any relation to Neil?
Excuse me?
Neil Simon!
Great writer.
You a great writer?
Oh, I don't know.
You'd know if you were great.
Mr Bernstein?
Kenneth Branagh on line 2. Kenneth Branagh! Another great writer!
Kenny B!
I loved the script!
I loved it! Fuckin' brilliant dialogue!
Well, hat's off to Shakespeare then!
- No answer.
- What?
I said no answer in Mr. Bernstein's room.
Oh, right.
Fine.
I'll just wait.
OK, ladies, arms around each other.
OK, now, Jade look into Ben's eyes, please.
Thank you very much, OK. No!
With love. Pandora. How's it going?
Oh, you know, Ben hates Jade. Jade hates Ben.
And Sasha hates everyone.
Nothing like a happy set.
Hello?
I'm waiting!
Paolo, when I have to ask for it, it's too late!
Who's the cutie?
Sasha's latest squeeze.
Argentinean. Apparently, Sasha picked him up at Ipanema Beach.
Amazing how Sasha always finds his 'assistants' at the beach.
Isn't it?
I suppose it allows him to examine their 'qualifications'.
Talullah? What's wrong?
Oh God! I just had a huge row with Freedom and I think it's over.
OK, I'm in the middle of a shoot...
Oh God! I feel like dying!
OK. Tell me exactly what happened.
Well, he came over and we shagged. And then I asked him what he thought about monogamy.
You don't talk about monogamy After you shag a guy...
- No, no but he said he liked monogamy.
- He did? Then he said he also likes oak and pine and maple...
So he's got a sense of humour.
Monogamy is not a laughing matter.
If Freedom ever cheated on me, I don't think I could go on!
Talullah! You've known the guy for a week.
Stop talking like you're in some kind of a movie.
I can't help it. I'm naturally dramatic.
Excuse me. Sasha needs you.
Oh, right.
- Who is that?
- Sasha's assistant.
He's gay. - What?
- Ay!
- How can you tell?
- Trust me. I have the best gaydar in London.
That boy gay as a goose.
Lucky fucking geese.
Excuse me, sir.
We've just got word Mr. Bernstein had to fly back to New York.
Oh, right.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry!
Now you love her!
Feed a grape. With love!
Real love! Excellent!
And crush a grape on her mouth.
Excellent!
Make it sexy!
More sexy! Make the grape sexy!
And kiss her.
On the mouth.
Excellent!
Sexy love! Yeah, I think we have it!
Jacks, would it be all right if I borrowed an outfit just for tonight?
I kind of have a date. - A date?
With who? - Oh, just this guy.
I mean, I'm not sure it's even technically a date.
It's just dinner.
Pandora. Pick out the sexiest outfit and go home immediately!
- But what about the wrap?
- I'll cover for you! What's more important? True love or fashion?
It's just a dinner...
OK. Let me rephrase that.
What's more important, anything or fashion?
Thanks, Jacks.
Dinner, 9 o'clock, Nobu.
Don't be late. I can't face them on my own.
- No problem.
Katie from Purple will be picking these up in the morning.
James!
How was your day?
- Anybody home?
- In here!
So how'd it go with the legendary giant?
- It didn't.
He stood me up.
- I'm sorry, Babies.
Why are you reading a cookbook in the nude?
It's'The Naked Chef.'
- What? You're keeping him company?
- I'm waiting for the shower.
You're almost out of shampoo so I had to use soap.
- Oh hi, Peter.
- Hello, James.
How are you? - Good, yes.
- Yes, good.
Well, I better be off.
My flight's at 9 and I've still got to pack.
- I'll call you when I land.
- Have fun in New York!
What are you doing?
Reading this delicious recipe for Beetroot Salad with marjoram and balsamic vinegar dressing!
- What are you doing with James?
- Nothing. You broke up with him a month ago!
I know, it's just sex.
He fills a void. Literally.
I don't see how you expect to meet someone new if you spend all your time with your ex.
Good point!
Maybe I should get back together with James so I spend less time with him.
I don't think it's funny.
Neither do I.
What's the point of shagging someone ad nauseam if you know you're never going to love them?
It's not so simple.
He's in love with you, Jacks. You're not in love with him.
It doesn't get more simple than that.
That's not fair!
I happen to care about James.
A lot. And I hate the fact that he feels more than me.
And I hate the fact that I'm not in love with him. Because I know I should be.
Because he's smart and sweet and decent and I don't want to hurt him.
So I keep hoping that I'll grow into it. That maybe one day I'll wake up and I'll feel...
- What?
- In love!
You know, dizzy and feverish and nauseous...
That's not love, Jacks. That's the flu.
Well, at least I'm trying! You big cynic.
I'm not a cynic!
When's the last time you even considered falling in love?
Today!
I'm not talking about some character in a novel or a movie.
Neither am I.
- What?
So, tell me everything!
What's his name?
David Williams.
- David Williams, and?
- And what?
And, who is he?
Where'd you meet him?
How'd you meet?
Tell me everything!
Well... I was on my way out of the hotel. And he was walking in.
He had these two paintings under his arm and a Sotheby's catalogue and we just sort of bumped into each other.
I can't explain it, but...
It was amazing. Because it was like I was finally seeing the person. I'd been waiting for my entire life.
Oh my God! That's so romantic!
So when do I get to meet him?
Right after I do?
- What?
- Well... We didn't actually meet. Per se.
But you know his name.
Yes, it was on the Sotheby's catalogue.
He dropped it and I picked it up.
And you didn't say anything?
You didn't speak?
And this is the person you think you could be in love with?
Someone that you've never even spoken to? Someone that you've never even met?
Look, Jacks, I know it sounds crazy.
I just... I really think he's the one.
Of course he is...
I don't think I can face this.
Of course you can!
We're here to support Finlay!
Besides, you can't stay at home every night, pining for someone you've never even met!
I thought this whole dead animal thing was 10 years ago.
In formaldehyde, yes.
But Finlay says this stuff isn't preserved.
- It rots right in front of your eyes!
Where is Fin anyway?
Say our hellos before I turn vegan.
Hello.
I'm Finlay McMillan and I would like to welcome all of you to Unicorn Gallagher's LIFE IS DEATH exhibit.
Freedom, get me a glass of champagne.
My throat's parched.
Do I look like a slave?
Before I introduce the artist himself, Talullah Wentworth has very kindly agreed to read one of her poems.
God help us!
I think it's sweet. Talullah wanting to be Sylvia Plath.
Well, she should fast forward and find an oven.
Thank you, Finlay.
And thank you Unicorn for this truly moving exhibit!
I'd like to dedicate this poem to Finlay's lover and my best friend, Troy Johnson, who's birthday it is today!
Troy would have loved to come tonight, but thanks to the conspiracy of silence between the Catholic Church and the Tories in the face of Aids, he can't.
Because he's dead.
- I'm not drunk enough for this.
- Neither is Finlay.
MEAT.
Big black dick in nice soft chick.
I never knew the thrill I'd feel, knowing how you had to steal.
You dangled your worm, I took the bait.
This fish is caught. It's only fate.
DIE DIE DIE White Imperialist Pigs.
Aristocracy is pale and weak.
You can't kill my love.
He's black.
Jacks! What are you doing here?
I just came back to make sure you're OK.
- I'm fine.
Sure. - Yeah?
Yeah!
I just hate this day, you know?
10 years.
How come I still miss him so much?
Because you are an amazing human being. And because he was an amazing human being.
And because I'm a silly old queen.
That too.
- Thanks, Jacks.
- For what?
For always remembering.
And for being there for me.
For all of us. I'm a superficial assistant at a major fashion magazine.
You'll ruin my reputation.
Come on. I'll give you a ride home.
Besides, I need your help with Peter.
He's fallen madly in love.
- Yeah?
With who? - I don't know.
Neither does he. Right!
Speaking of boyfriends, how's what's his name?
- You mean Freedom?
- Freedom. - What kind of name is Freedom?
- Jamaican, darling.
- Why didn't he come to brunch?
- We had a row about his car.
I told him I don't generally get into vehicles that cost less than my handbag.
And he accused me of being a spoiled bitch who's only in love with his skin color.
Which is surprisingly insightful for someone who's stoned 24 hours a day.
- Oh, and the creep keeps calling.
- What creep?
From the phone company.
His name's Tony. He calls me 5 times a day begging me to go out with him.
Apparently my voice haunts him.
You have an obscene caller from British Telecom?
I told her she should report him to the police.
I would, but he promised me free broadband.
- Hi, guys, sorry I'm late. - Hi, Fin. How are you?
Hi, just a cappuccino please.
So, I made a few calls and I'm pretty certain it's who I thought.
Are you serious?
Well, he was definitely at the Chancery Hotel last Monday.
- Oh, my God! - What are we talking about?
Finlay's figured out who Peter fell in love with last week.
He was at the Chancery Hotel, monday morning, seeing a client!
- Who was? - David Williams!
- You know the guy I bumped into?
- I know David! I love biblical names.
I used to have a cat named David. King David!
- What's he like?
- He's dead, fell out of a tree.
He's head of Sotheby's Contemporary Art Department.
He's smart, charming, kind.
Attractive, as you know.
All the rich ladies have crushes on him!
During his auctions, they all try and outbid each other just to impress him!
I bet my Mother's one of those rich old women.
- Is he gay?
- He's gay!
So was my cat.
Actually, I can't believe I haven't tried to fix you up ages ago.
He's perfect for you!
And he was very intrigued by what I told him.
What you told him?
What did you tell him?
OK, everything.
- But he was really flattered.
- Oh God! - There's no way I can meet him now.
- What? Why not?
Because it's too set up!
There's no way he'll be into me knowing I'm so into him.
David's not like that!
Trust me! I have to agree with Peter.
I think accidental meets are much better.
Take me and Freedom. We met in a launderette.
After I told you he was going to be there!
Which isn't to say accidents can't be planned.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
I'm always like this when I have to see my mother.
Would you rather not go?
No, don't be silly!
This is your big night!
Besides Mother loves you.
She loves this David. Her theme song is 'Matchmaker, Matchmaker.'
Do you want a brownie?
I made them myself.
These are very good.
Yes, they've got quite a lot of hash in them.
Talullah! What's wrong?
Freedom's having an affair.
An affair? You've only been going out for 2 weeks!
Who's he having an affair with?
Me, I just found out he's married.
- Are you OK?
I just lost my keys and they're playing hard to get.
Tada! We haven't met properly.
I'm Paolo Sarmiento by the way.
Emily Jackson.
But all my friends just call me 'Jacks.'
All my friends just call me Paolo.
You look very beautiful.
Well, I'm going to this black tie thing for my roommate.
Well, it's not exactly for my roommate. But...
I mean, thanks.
Take care.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh! That's OK.
I have to meet Sasha in Bloomsbury so...
That's where I'm headed!
- Get in!
Oh, Talullah!
There you are! This is Klaus Fassbinder.
Klaus, this is my daughter Talullah. And this is her best friend, Paul.
- It's Peter, Mother!
- It's all right.
Darling, you could have worn something nicer.
You could have worn something. Full stop.
Sorry, Fassbinder, are you related to the director?
- Who?
- Oh, never mind.
Mrs. Wentworth, thank you so much for this invitation.
Oh please! Call me Felicity!
David is perfect for you, darling!
I can't think why I didn't set you two up earlier!
So, you're Felicity's daughter?
Only by birth.
So don't hold it against me.
Donatella!
Whoever designed those heels must really hate women.
I designed those heels.
And thank goodness you did!
Otherwise Mother's arse would be dusting the floor.
So how long have you and Sasha been together?
3 months.
Really? How did you two meet?
- It's a bit embarrassing actually.
- Oh go on.
We met at a beach party at Ipanema.
Sasha wanted to take my picture.
I said no.
He pestered me.
And one thing led to another. And...
Well, here I am.
Sasha's a wonderful photographer.
Yes. So everyone says.
You're not interested in photography?
Oh, very much.
I studied it at university.
But I'm more into reportage. Capturing real moments.
Sasha's brilliant at capturing real moments. Don't you think?
Not really.
I think Sasha's brilliant at creating moments. Most of which aren't real.
But then again, fashion isn't real, so maybe he's capturing reality after all.
What do you think?
I think people shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them.
Excuse me?
I mean, thanks to a chance encounter at a beach party, you hook up with one of the world's top fashion photographers.
First class travel, exotic locations. You really hit quite the jackpot.
You think that's why I'm with him?
Well, it's obviously not out of respect for his work.
Do you always judge people so quickly?
I'm not judging you. No?
Then maybe you're judging Sasha.
You seem to think the only reason someone might be with him is for this 'jackpot.'
This is fine.
Thanks for the ride.
I would like to welcome you all to this year's 'Fashion Against the Impending Threat of Global Warming.'
There is nothing more important right now, than global poverty.
I mean in the warming sense.
Actually, I was just talking to Donatella.
- Sorry, I'm late.
So is he here? - Not yet.
- Where's Talullah?
- In the bathroom.
She's been eating large quantities of hash brownies.
- Again? - Yeah.
So with no further ado, I would like to introduce any available British celebrity!
I mean...
Angus Deaton!
- Bitch!
- Wanker!
Thank you and thank you to Felicity for all her.
Jacks!
You look so pretty!
I think you're very, very pretty Jacks.
Thank you, Talullah.
I think you're very pretty too.
But not as pretty as Freedom's wife!
I'm sure you're far prettier than Freedom's wife.
You're just saying that because you're a POOF!
Talullah! What's wrong with you?
Genetics.
- Hello, Jones.
- It's Jacks, Mother!
- You look lovely!
- Thank you. So do you!
I don't!
I'm pasty white.
Why wasn't I born black?
OK, first up then we have an outfit called Ice Dream donated by Klaus Fassbinder!
Let's start the bidding. If you would at 1,000 pounds.
Thank you, sir. David's flight from New York must have been delayed.
But he should be here at any minute.
He was very intrigued by what I told him!
What, what you told him?
You know, about how you saw him at the hotel and it was love at first sight! And what a catch you are. How it's about time you found yourself a nice boyfriend!
You told him all that?
He seemed very flattered Paul!
1,500 pounds.
Any advance on 1,500 pounds?
Oing once, going twice... 10,000 pounds!
10,000 pounds! Don't touch the dress!
Any advance on 10,000 pounds.
No? Oing once. Oing twice!
I was only joking.
I was just kidding!
I was only joking.
Charity!
Hello? Oh, hi James.
- Do I live here?
- No, I live here.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, Peter, I feel so bad.
C'mon, drink this.
No, I mean about you. Not getting to meet Robbie Williams because of me.
It's OK.
I'm loving angels instead... - How's our patient?
- She'll live.
- Well, I have great news!
- Oh yes, what?
- You know James is in New York.
- Yes, that is great news.
Who guess he ran into at one of the Art Auctions over there.
- Who? - David Williams!
Please, please tell me he didn't say anything!
- Was he not meant to say anything?
- Oh, my god! News of my crush has just travelled across the Atlantic Ocean!
David Williams must think I'm a needy, desperate freak!
Well, there's no point in pretending to be something you're not!
Where do you think you're going?
I just remembered. I need a pedicure.
Talullah. I think just this once, you should paint your own toenails.
Don't be ridiculous!
I need a lot more incentive to bend over that far.
There's nail polish here.
- Oh, are we at the salon?
- Ready for lunch?
- Sure am!
Is everything OK?
Oh yeah. Fine. T- cells unchanged.
Liver holding up. Everything's great.
So despite your fragile beauty, you're actually built like an ox.
O figure.
Did you hear the news about David?
Yes. Talullah's Mother told me he never even showed.
Which actually proves my theory he must think I'm a stalker freak.
I'm sure he doesn't think that.
Fin, in 3 short weeks he's heard about my desperate obsession from you, from Talullah's mother, and now from James, all the way in New York!
Read this!
David didn't show because he had to stay in New York. Because he was promoted to Sotheby's New York office.
Satisfied?
I can't believe I drove him out the country.
Come on.
Have you ever thought this whole 'true love' thing might be a conspiracy?
- A conspiracy?
- Yeah, a capitalist conspiracy. A lie concocted by the Film, Publishing and Music industries. All pushing this thing, this concept that doesn't even exist!
True love doesn't exist?
Well, think about it. Where is it besides songs, books and films?
I mean, who can honestly say 'I will always love you?
- Whitney Houston?
- Yeah, when she's high on crack.
The point is, Everyone's miserable because they're looking for this nonexistent 'thing,' or else they're miserable because they think they've settled for less.
I'm not miserable.
And I believe in true love.
Yeah, which is why you're still sleeping with your ex-boyfriend.
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is on.
Wanna watch?
I just told you films have destroyed my ability to love.
I thought that was your mother.
Good point.
Shove over.
This is your favorite film?
Look at me. Can't you tell?
- Where's Daphne?
- Out.
Can I give her a message?
These are the contact sheets from the shoot. I've marked my selects.
Tell Daphne my assistant Paolo is handling the retouching, so if she needs any other prints, she can call him at the lab.
And if she needs me, I'll be at my boyfriend's in Paris.
- Paolo?
- What about him?
Paolo isn't your boyfriend?
Why would you think he was my boyfriend?
I just assumed. Talking to Paolo.
- Really?
- I'm sorry.
No need to be sorry, carino!
You're not the first person who gets this impression from Paolo.
To be honest, I think maybe he had a little crush on me.
I'm very flattered of course, and if I wasn't already involved.
But, you know, it's all about timing, no?
And right now, I have a train to catch!
These look great.
Look, I'm sorry about the other night.
Sasha told me everything and I feel like an idiot.
Could you please forgive me?
You don't know me.
If you did, you'd know I'd never take advantage of Sasha.
Anyway. I should go.
Have a good weekend.
You, too.
- So how do I get to know you?
- What? - How about over a cup of coffee?
It's the least I could do after the other day!
Besides, we can't have you all alone in London on a Friday night!
You make me sound like an exchange student.
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No? Then why else would someone like you want to have a coffee with me?
Someone like me?
It's OK. Really. I forgive you.
So you can stop feeling sorry for me or guilty or whatever.
I'm sure you have better things to do on a Friday night.
Este... Where did you learn to speak Spanish like that?
What? Not what you'd expect from 'someone like me?
I find you very confusing.
So does my boyfriend.
My ex-boyfriend.
Do you want to get a drink?
There's this amazing place near here.
Tonight's South American night.
But only because I feel sorry for myself, and I know you must feel guilty.
I really appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.
Finlay thinks the world of you.
And I think THE WORLD of Finlay!
Yes, well... He said you really sorted him out on the relationship front. And I could certainly use some help there.
You see I've never actually been in a relationship except in my own head.
And how long did that last?
- What?
- The relationship in your head.
No. I mean, it's an ongoing problem. They only last in my head.
For varying amounts of time.
So you have a problem with monogamy?
No, no that. No, that's not my problem.
Denial is not a river in Egypt!
Not a river in Egypt.
D'you see what I did there?
Just that's a little therapist joke.
Doesn't always work. - OK, right.
Paul? - Peter.
- Sorry?
Yes, it is.
You're absolutely right.
Peter. That's a good start.
I think I can help you.
- You do?
- I do.
I think you are stuck in that pre relationship moment of infatuation and you need to be reminded that a real relationship has many, many, many more stages.
Stages.
I like that.
Relationships are best measured by farting.
Excuse me?
The stages of a relationship can be defined by farting.
Stage 1 is the conspiracy of silence.
This is a fantasy period where both parties pretend that they have no bodily waste.
This illusion is very quickly shattered by that first shy 'ooh did you fart?
' followed by the sheepish admission of truth.
This heralds a period of deeper intimacy. A period I like to call the 'fart honeymoon'.
Where both parties find each other's gas just the cutest thing in the world.
But of course no honeymoon can last forever.
And so we reach the critical fork in the fart.
Either the fart loses its power to amuse and embarrass, thereby signifying true love or else, it begins to annoy and disgust. Thereby symbolizing all that is blocked and rancid in the formerly beloved.
Do you see what I'm getting at?
Earth to Peter?
I was talking to Tony.
Who's Tony?
You know. Tony. From the phone company.
You're seeing your obscene phone caller?
Of course I'm not 'seeing him', darling.
We're having a strictly phone-based relationship.
So what's going on?
Finlay thinks I should see his therapist.
Finlay sees a therapist?
Yeah, some woman he says is really good with relationships.
Maybe I should see her.
I think I need to get in touch with my inner child.
Talullah, if you get in touch with your inner child you're going to need an inner nanny.
Oh, I don't trust nannies.
They're all whores!
- What about Mary Poppins?
- Slut! What are you talking about?
She left the convent, married Christopher Plummer, and then took all his children up the Alps. Speaking of The Sound of Music, where's Jacks?
The riots completely shut down Buenos Aires.
It was unbelievable!
The whole country, rich, poor, young, old, everyone for this one moment, came together.
- These are incredible!
- The moment was incredible.
You captured the moment.
My friend Finlay owns an art gallery.
I'd love to show these to him.
- That's very kind of you but...
- Very kind of me?
What? You think you're some kind of charity case?
- Don't tell me you're afraid.
I'm afraid you're drunk.
Because I think you're talented?
Because you've had 3 caiperinhas.
- Do you know how to tango?
Because, everyone knows you can't be drunk and tango.
So if I can tango, then I'm not drunk.
And I get to show your pictures to Finlay. Well, then you're right and I won't tell a soul.
So about my friend Finlay.
- So tell me your secret.
- What secret?
How an American can speak like a Spaniard and dance like an Argentinean.
- I'm not American.
Well, not technically.
I was born in England. My Father was English. My Mother was Spanish.
I grew up with my Mother's family in America. After my parents died.
How old were you when you moved to America?
Five.
- I'm sorry I didn't mean to pry.
- It's not that.
It's just I don't want to be one of those awful characters out of a movie that gushes out their past while the violins play.
I mean I had a bad age five.
I had a terrible age five, actually.
But all in all, since then, my life's been pretty blessed.
- So do you live alone?
- No, I live with Peter.
- Oh? Your boyfriend?
- Oh God no! He's my best friend.
We went to college together.
He's gay. All the good ones are...
You should meet him actually.
He's a brilliant writer. Screenplays.
Well, that's the goal at least.
He's just the sweetest, funniest, kindest guy I know.
If he wasn't gay, I'd have married him years ago.
- He sounds wonderful.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Nothing.
You wanna have dinner?
Oh, sure!
Great!
Come over at 8!
Well, I had an amazing time tonight.
Me, too.
I've never been for a walk in the morning before. At least, not since I've been in New York...
- Hey, babies!
- Hi! - What are you doing?
- Watching 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.'
- Again?
- Yeah, I'm doing research.
Stop doing research and would you write your goddamn screenplay!
Did you realize, in the book, the male character's gay?
That's why they have such an amazing friendship. Because she feels safe with him.
Whereas in the film, he's straight and she just wears gorgeous hats.
Speaking of gorgeous, I just met the cutest Argentinean boy.
Oh, yeah?
He's absolutely gorgeous.
And sweet and smart. And an amazing tango dancer!
That's very useful in today's world.
Who also happens to be an exceptionally talented photographer.
Does this mean we're finally over James?
- James?
He's gay!
- James is gay? !
No, Paolo. Paolo is gay.
He's been assisting for Sasha, you know the fashion photographer and I thought that they were, you know, sleeping together but now they're not.
And he really wants to meet you. He doesn't know anyone in London.
And I told him that you'd have dinner with him...
- What? - Tomorrow.
It'll be good for you.
It'll take your mind off.
Jacks! There is absolutely no way I am going on another blind date.
The answer's no!
Hi! Come in! Come in!
I'm afraid I'm running late!
Oh, these are lovely, but Peter hates flowers.
We'll pretend they're for me.
Can I get you something to drink?
Champagne?
Sure.
So, how was your Saturday?
What did you do today?
Oh, yeah. I went to the Tate.
The Museum.
The Tate Modern Museum.
- Your first time? - Yep.
And? What did you think?
I mean, it's pretty amazing visually.
The way it's built.
Isn't it just visually stunning?
Yeah! Paolo, I can't hear you.
Can you come back here?
I don't want to have to scream.
So what else did you?
After the Tate Modern?
I'm sorry, I didn't... I'll just close the door.
Oh, it's fine!
Peter and I always have our best conversations when I'm in the bath.
- Jacks?
- I'll be right out!
- Is that Peter?
- No.
James. Do me a favour.
O out and tell him I'll be out in 5. And close the door behind you.
Jacks is in the bath.
She says she'll be out in 5.
- Who are you?
- Paolo Sarmiento. I, I work with Jacks.
- Hello? - Hi, Peter.
I'm Paolo.
Hi! I've heard so much about you.
Really?
- Where's, where's Jacks?
- In the bath, apparently.
Right.
Excuse me for a second?
- What's he doing here?
- He just flew back from New York.
Not James. Paolo!
- He's having dinner with you.
- No! No. No way.
Why not? Give me one good reason.
- It's too soon.
- Too soon?
- I'm still not over David.
- You don't even know David.
That's a technicality.
Besides, after everything everyone's said, I feel like I know him very well.
Babies, David doesn't even live in London anymore.
Oh, so you're saying I should forget about him purely for geographic reasons?
I'm saying that I don't think it's healthy for you to have a long distance relationship with someone you've never even met!
How does that look? More blush?
- No, you're good.
- Thank you.
I'm afraid Jacks sort of surprised me with this.
Yes. She surprised me too.
Yeah, well, that's our Jacks!
Full of surprises!
So is James...
Are they together?
Well, technically no.
But for all practical purposes, yes.
- I don't understand.
- Join the club.
When it comes to love, Jacks is completely incomprehensible.
So does she love him?
I suppose, in a way, she must.
I just don't think she likes him very much.
But come to think of it, Jacks never goes out with men she actually likes.
You're insane.
Why, because I don't like you having strange men with you while you're in the bath?
- James, he's gay, for God sakes!
- Great, another poof.
Since when did you become homophobic?
Since I realized being gay is the only way to be intimate with you.
Don't be absurd.
I can't believe I've just vomited the entire saga of my imaginary love life with David Williams.
I enjoyed it. It's like a movie.
- Yeah, but you must think I'm crazy.
- Yes. But I like crazy people.
So do I.
But enough about me.
What do you think about me?
No, I'm joking.
No, I'm not. No, I was.
Sam, can we have some sambucca, please?
- Don't answer.
- I really should.
- Why?
- It might be somebody.
Talullah! Oh sweetie.
Hold on a sec. It's Talullah. She's having a crisis.
How bloody unusual.
OK. Tell me exactly what happened.
He's stopped calling.
- Freedom?
- Tony.
Who's Tony?
You know. Tony from the phone company.
The psycho who was making obscene calls?
They weren't obscene!
They were sweet.
It was the perfect relationship.
I never felt ugly or fat.
I knew he wasn't with me for my money.
- I miss him, Jacks!
- Talullah, don't be ridiculous.
I can't help how I feel!
Why is it as soon as I fall in love with a man, he abandons me?
You don't love Tony!
Yes I do!
I do love Tony.
What did I do wrong?
OK. Let's indulge this sick fantasy.
What's the last thing you said to Prince Charming?
'Stop pestering me or I'll call the police! '
Oh, this is us.
Do you want to come upstairs for another drink?
I want to, but I probably shouldn't.
I have to be at the lab at 7.
- But I really enjoyed meeting you.
So did I.
- Are you OK here?
Oh God! - You don't! I...
I'm so sorry!
I was just... - I'm really embarrassed.
- No, no, no, listen, Peter. I really like you a lot, but...
But you don't like me in that way.
Look, I know that speech.
I use that speech because I actually wrote that speech...
I'm not gay.
- I didn't write that part!
- I'm straight.
Since when?
I suppose I first noticed when I was around 8.
I thought it was just a phase, you know, but eventually I had to accept the truth.
I like women.
Oh this is good!
This is really good.
You know, Jacks is useless at fixing people up...
- Jacks thought I was gay?
- Oh she sure did.
And I'm really going to enjoy making her feel stupid about this one.
Please don't.
I think I should tell her myself.
You and Jacks?
I won't say a word. I promise.
- Thanks. - Cross my heart.
- I should go.
Yes. - Goodnight.
So what did you say to Jacks when you got back?
- Nothing, she wasn't there.
- But you're going to tell her.
Sorry, I'm late! I was in the middle of an absolutely gripping book.
I couldn't put it down.
Oh, what book's that?
My memoirs, darling.
I've decided to publish.
Bloody Mary please.
Light on the bloody.
- Where's Jacks?
- Spending the weekend with James.
- Oh God, how disgusting!
I'm sorry, but James Wildstone stands for absolutely everything I despise.
I thought he was a good friend of your family?
Exactly my point.
Well, we shouldn't judge. Maybe he's good sex.
Oh, don't be absurd.
He's public school.
So he probably likes being spanked.
Or buggered.
Or both. - Sounds like good sex to me.
- And me!
And me actually.
I can't believe he's so late!
Pandora, try Sasha's mobile.
- I tried it 5 minutes ago.
- Try again. And leave another message.
Do you have his boyfriend's number in Paris?
He got back from Paris last night.
He broke up with his boyfriend this weekend.
- He did?
Is he OK? - Not really.
But Jacks, look, it'll be fine.
Sasha always turns up. - I left another message.
So I had a nice evening with Peter the other night.
Oh my God!
Really? Isn't he great?
Smart, funny and cute.
Yes, he's absolutely lovely.
Where's Daphne?
She had to go to court today.
She left me in charge.
Who put up those lights?
I did, I thought you might want them in the shot.
You're not here to think!
You're here to do what I think!
OK? So now you take all this down and you bring me a ring light.
Pandora? Where is Pandora?
Where is it?
Here.
What's your job?
I'm a wardrobe assistant.
A wardrobe assistant?
No, you're a piece of shit!
How dare you call my mobile every 10 minutes and leave me endless messages.
I told her to call, Sasha!
We were worried.
- You were late. - I know I was late!
I just don't need a nobody leaving me endless messages about it!
- I understand you had a rough weekend...
- No, you don't understand!
You understand nothing!
And I suggest you stop meddling with things you don't understand, and just do your job! Whatever the hell that is.
I don't know, go steam something!
Sasha! Jacks, he doesn't mean that...
- Don't you tell her what I mean!
- Don't speak to her like that.
Get out!
You're fired! You heard me? You're fired!
O back to Argentina! You and your little pathetic snapshots!
Anyone else have something to say?
I have something to say.
- Apologize!
- I'm sorry?
I said apologize!
- Are you insane?
- Obviously!
I work at Vogue!
But don't change the subject!
- Apologize.
- Or else?
Or else, I'm walking out with all those dresses.
I have a better idea. I will do the walking out thing. And let's see what Daphne has to say about that!
Paolo, can I ask a favour?
Ah, the classic movie moment when the underdog gets to prove his real worth and win the heart of his true love!
Don't give away the ending!
It's a romantic comedy! How do you think it ends?
Hi, sunshine, how are you?
I just had the most surreal day.
I had a huge fight with Sasha. Paolo took over the shoot, and he was absolutely brilliant.
I'm probably going to get fired tomorrow, but it was so worth it just to see Paolo in action.
Oh my God!
This is so scary!
What's she watching?
Notting Hill.
So what did you think about Paolo? Was I right or was I right?
Are those my only options?
Oh no, don't tell me you didn't like him.
I liked him a lot! I'm just not sure I'm his type.
Of course, you're his type!
He told me himself he thought you were 'lovely.'
Well, I didn't see that coming!
What?
Julia Roberts ending up with Hugh rant!
You know, Jacks. When I told you to take care of the shoot, I was thinking more along the lines of ordering the sushi, not enraging our top photographer.
I can't help it if Sasha's an overpampered monster.
We work in fashion. Everyone's an overpampered monster.
Yes, but that isn't an excuse to be so vile to people.
Besides, his pictures don't have an ounce of truth to them.
But since when does truth have anything to do with fashion?
Well, it doesn't.
- So you were Sasha's assistant? - Yes.
How very 'All About Eve.'
'All About Eve?
It's a movie, darling. It's about an assistant who seems all sweet and innocent but is really quite ambitious and ruthless.
You should rent it sometime.
Daphne, he was doing me a favour.
- I've seen it.
- You have? And what did you think?
I found it rather silly actually.
The idea that Bette Davis could be the victim of anyone is absurd.
Pick 4 and run it.
Oh my God, Paolo! You were amazing!
Thanks. So were you!
The way you handled Daphne!
I mean I knew you were talented, but I had no idea that under that shy, sweet exterior was such steely confidence!
What other secrets are you keeping from me?
Actually, Jacks, I did want to talk to you about...
- Ah, Jacks! There you are!
- James? Hello, Darling!
Hello? James, you remember Paolo?
Yes. Hello, Paolo?
James? What are you doing here?
Well, actually, I was just having lunch across the street and I came to tell you the good news in person.
What good news?
Peter is finally going to meet the love of his life!
- What? - David Williams is in town. He's leading a special auction at Sotheby's.
And he and I were just having lunch together, and I just happened to mention Peter's name. And he suggested that we bring Peter to the auction tonight!
- He did?
- Well, actually, I suggested it.
But he thinks it's a great idea!
So did I do good or did I do good?
You did great.
I should probably go.
Paolo, congratulations on today.
Tell Peter I wish him good luck with David.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking about Peter and David living happily ever after.
What if I've written the worst script ever?
What if everyone hates it?
Look, most great artists have to deal with rejection in their lifetime.
Yes, I'm not a great artist! Look, I know I'm not some genius like Van ogh.
Thank God. I like my men with 2 ears.
I'm, I'm being serious.
What if I'm not any good?
What if I have no talent?
Are you asking if I'll still love you?
- Snap out of it will you?
We're here.
There you are! You guys are late.
Fin, I'm not sure this is such a good idea.
It's an excellent idea.
He's perfect for you, Paul, darling!
Peter! His name is Peter!
You're about to meet the love of your life!
To the left!
There is no need to be so nasty to me just because I don't remember people's names.
550 with you madam, thank you very much. - That's him!
Anything further on 580? - I can't see him. - There!
I have $600,000.
That's not him. That's not him!
- You're kidding? - No!
- That's David? - No!
- Are you sure? - Yes!
I have no idea!
Of course that's David!
He's just cut his hair.
What hair?
He's got a lovely smile!
- He's just cut his hair!
- And he's lost some weight.
- I don't think so, Fergus...
- It's Finlay!
- What? - That is not him! OK?
That is not the man I bumped into at the Chancery Hotel. That is not him!
Well, he's good enough!
Oh no! No, he's not good enough!
Because, that man right there, the real David Williams actually exists!
The real David Williams happens to be a living, breathing, on-the-market gay man!
Morning, sunshine. How you feeling?
- Exhausted.
You?
- Fine. I'm going to brunch with Finlay and the wrong David.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry you outed a total stranger or sorry it's the wrong total stranger?
Both.
I'm quite relieved, to be honest. At least it's over and done with.
- You OK?
- I'm fine. I was just up most of the night thinking...
About?
Oh, love and other disasters.
- That must be Finlay.
- Send him my love.
- I don't have to go to this thing.
- O!
I'll be right down.
- Morning.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
That's Peter, he must have forgotten his keys.
I'm going to take a bath.
- Are you OK?
Not really.
I haven't slept all night.
Come in.
I've been wanting to talk to you about the other night with Peter. But it seems every time I'm about to, something or someone gets in the way.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
- He's not here, is he?
- No. No, he's out.
Good.
- I feel terrible.
Why should you feel terrible?
I had no idea how you felt.
What the hell is going on?
- I don't believe it. - No, wait!
- Wait! - James, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me!
He needs to talk! What's your problem?
He's my problem!
Excuse me?
I may not speak Spanish, but I'm not an idiot.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you and that bloody Paolo.
He was upset about Peter. He wanted to talk.
Bullshit!
- What? - I want him out of your life!
- Or else?
- Or else we're through!
See. This is exactly why I don't want to be in a relationship with you!
Oh really?
Then what the hell is this? What the hell are we in?
I don't know.
This is just some sort of fucking game to you, isn't it?
What's a game?
This. We fuck and then you say you don't want a relationship.
- It's not a game.
- Oh no?
It's the truth.
Bullshit! I don't believe it is the truth!
For the last six months you've been saying one thing and then doing another. You've been playing me!
No!
But I am sorry.
What are you sorry about?
I didn't mean to hurt you!
Fucking condescending!
I didn't mean it like that.
I want...
What do you want?
I want this to end.
So after all that, I'm not the one?
Bit of a relief, huh?
I suppose so.
You must have thought I was a stalker freak. Thanks to my discreet friends.
We were just trying to help.
Yes, by making me out to be a desperate fantasist?
You are a desperate fantasist.
- No, I'm not actually.
I'm a fantasist, I'm not desperate.
Well, I suppose I'd never have lived up to your fantasy anyway.
Trust me, David. Nobody could.
- Tom!
- Sorry, I'm late!
- Tom, this is Peter and Finlay.
- Hey, Tom. I think we've met. - Finlay!
How have you been?
- Great!
And you? Can't complain.
Can't complain. Finally out of the art world!
Tom's acting now.
- Acting?
- Yeah, that's why I'm late.
Had an audition for a new drama at the BBC.
- How'd it go?
- Good!
Well, great actually.
I was so inside the character. You know?
And then they asked for a monologue so I did that one from Streetcar which everyone loves.
The actress I was doing it with, she was hopeless. I was doing my best...
Are you OK?
- That's him.
- Who? That's the guy I bumped into at the Hotel!
What?
Sorry.
Excuse me, I just need to use the loo, actually.
- Finlay?
I'll just... ive you a hand!
I can't believe you said 'I'll give you a hand! '
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! But listen, I think I know what happened!
Tom used to be David's assistant.
They both must have gone to the hotel, but Tom arrived with the paintings on his own.
Which is when you bumped into him!
Great!
So, now what do I do?
Well, I'd probably zip up.
Mustn't seem over-eager.
I can't believe you're cooking dinner for some guy you just met yesterday!
His name is Tom.
You know what they say. 'The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.'
Don't you think that's aiming a bit high?
Don't you think you should applaud my courage?
I would but my hands are full.
Anyway, I'm off.
Don't you at least want to meet Tom? Why?
I prefer Paolo.
Maybe that's something worth considering.
Little late for that.
I've been trying to call you since yesterday but your mobile isn't working.
I, I ran out of credit.
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
I have to fly back to Argentina tomorrow.
- What? Why?
