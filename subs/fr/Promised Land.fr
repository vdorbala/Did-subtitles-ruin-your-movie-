Thank you.
Can I get either of you gentlemen anything else?
You want another drink?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
We'll take another bottle of the Chateau Margaux.
You'll be fine.
Listen, I'm sorry Michael isn't here yet.
His plane got delayed getting into Teterboro.
Oh, that's fine. It's fine.
He likes to meet all the executive candidates.
It's kind of a tradition or a neurosis.
It's nice of him, though.
It is actually. Until he does his one joke.
"I thought you said he wasn't handsome."
That's an oldie but a goodie, I guess.
So what time you heading out tomorrow?
Well, actually, Sue's up there now.
I was gonna get the last bus tonight and get an early start tomorrow morning.
You know, when we called the office out west, you were the only name they gave us.
That's nice of 'em.
Listen, Steve, we're a nine billion dollar company. Yeah.
Someone's recommending you, it's not nice, it's numbers.
I appreciate that.
Now let me ask you something.
You guys have closed more towns than the team behind you by almost triple digits.
But the price point that we pay out on your leases is half of everyone else's.
How do you do that?
Well, I'm from Eldridge, Iowa.
Meaning?
It might as well be Rifle, Colorado,
Dish, Texas or Lafayette, Louisiana.
Any of these towns we've sold.
I know them, they know me.
Well, unfortunately, the rest of our road teams don't find it quite so easy.
I grew up in a large farming community.
Football Fridays, tractor pulls, cow tipping, all of it.
I mean, I'm one of two guys in my graduating class who went to college and studied something other than agriculture.
It's the biggest fight my grandfather and I ever had.
Just the pride, I guess.
No.
It's delusional self mythology. It's bullshit.
We had a Caterpillar plant down in Davenport a few miles away.
They closed that down my junior year.
I didn't think anything of it.
By the time my senior prom rolled around I got to see, first hand, just how little legs we had to stand on.
I mean, the whole farming town fantasy was just shattered.
The truth was, without the plant, without the industry, we had nothing.
And my whole town was...
I'm not selling them natural gas.
I'm selling them the only way they have to get back.
Best of luck, Steve.
Is this the guy?
I thought you said he wasn't handsome!
Sorry I'm late.
Had to stop at home on my way down.
My daughter, it's her birthday today.
She's turning 13 already.
I can't believe it.
Thank you.
Good morning, boss.
Oh, stop it.
Am I supposed to call you "boss" now?
They'll let me know.
That's the best you could do?
No. But I wasn't looking for the best, was I?
You know what I mean.
Stick.
You do it on purpose.
You're right, I do.
And was it worth it?
Suck it!
"Rob's Guns, Groceries, Guitars and Gas."
God, I wish I'd thought of that.
So where'd they put you up?
The Sheraton?
Oh, Four Seasons.
What? Mmm-hmm.
Jesus!
Yup!
And I was right, this is the entry point for the whole state.
Well, I like that.
It's like dominoes.
Yeah. It is.
Hey, what season is it?
Is this... They still wearing flannel up here?
Place like this, they always do flannel.
Yeah, or camo.
I am not wearing camo.
You need work gloves?
I never use them.
That's a yes.
Okay, you 'bout ready?
Yep.
Hey...
Boots!
Huh? No.
I'm not going over this with you again.
These were my grandfather's boots, and they're made in America.
Yeah, like in 1947!
Yeah, they're an heirloom.
Oh, my God!
They weren't kidding about the guitars.
I guess you're not here to buy a guitar.
You're the natural gas people.
I'm sorry?
Apologizing right off the bat, I like it.
It's endearing and vulnerable and yet honest and direct.
Your ID card, it's kind of a dead giveaway.
It's about time you all showed up.
Yeah?
Well, hell yeah.
We can't sell the scenery, can we?
Oh, that's good.
You wanna come work for us?
What, and leave all this?
Cash only.
Really?
No.
Shut it.
Oh, go ahead. If you have to, go ahead.
No, I'm just...
I just think it's great that you're making friends.
Now shut up.
I can't believe this is right outside the city. It looks like Kentucky.
Two hours outside any city looks like Kentucky. You should know that.
Something weird about those horses?
No. Not really.
Wait.
Are they small?
They seem very small.
They seem small to you, right?
My eyesight's going.
Maybe they're ponies?
Those are not ponies.
Remember, new region, so we can go as high as 5,000 and 18%.
Don't ponies have big heads? I mean, like, proportionally?
Hello, there.
Are you the owner of this place?
No, sir.
No?
Well, how come you're doing all the work?
I don't know.
Well, who do I talk to about that?
My dad.
Your dad.
Okay.
I'm gonna find your dad, I'm gonna straighten all this out.
I thought the census was over.
No, I'm with the natural gas company.
You got a second? Oh, hell!
Why didn't you say so?
Come on in.
You been shopping?
Sorry?
I said, you been...
Here, you got a tag.
There you go. Oh.
Well, so much for trying to look local.
Nice boots.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
That is some wild color, right?
Is that Thor?
Iron Man.
Let me see.
Oh, yeah.
God, it's nice.
Can I have that?
My kid would really like that.
I'm kidding.
Reading this mornin' about all the gas drilling' in Pennsylvania.
"Stanton Gas." That you guys?
Oh, no, I'm representing Global Crosspower Solutions.
But there's a bunch of us.
Well, you're probably the best.
Hey, you wanna come work for us?
Even before the drilling, the initial phase of development will boost your town's tax revenue.
That means that money will be injected into your town immediately.
Here's what it means to me.
One of the only reasons I live where I live is because of the school my son goes to.
I want everything for him.
And everything, to me, starts with an education.
So our leases start at $2,000.
That's it?
That's right.
Well, that's not necessarily life-changing money, is it?
Well, it's per acre. Uh-huh.
You have 20. So...
I think there are a lot of people around here who would say $40,000, well, that's pretty good money.
Especially for doing nothing.
But the real reason I'm here at this early stage is because our research shows that your particular plot of land has a potentially high yield.
Now what that means is that not only the size of the deposit, but actually, the quality of the shale is in the top tier.
Yeah.
Carson's chances of going to college are too low.
And without a college education, in this job market, that means manual labor.
And those jobs are gone.
Technology is our sons' future.
There's no reason your town shouldn't have a state-of-the-art high school.
Get an education that allows him to compete at the highest level.
And that's why we offer an 8% share in any and all profits that we see from your well.
So with this top tier level shit, what kinda money are you talkin' about?
Oh, I can't say yet...
At least ballpark it for me.
I mean, other people in similar situations.
Millions.
I mean, you mean per...
You know, you guys or...
You...
Could be a millionaire.
I'll show you what a standard lease agreement looks like.
That's it right there.
Nice job today.
Kind of anticlimactic.
I thought it would be harder.
It's too easy.
What?
I got it.
Really?
VP of Land Management.
Well, that's great!
I'm proud of ya.
Holy shit.
Danny, I don't know what to say.
A no-hitter.
It was only two innings.
Did anybody get on base?
No.
Well, then that makes it almost a perfect game!
That is amazing!
It's not the whole game, Mom.
Okay, well, you should...
Still, you should be celebrating.
You shouldn't be sitting here talking to me.
Hey, MS. T!
Hi, Colin.
So where are you guys headed?
I don't know.
Sarah Dayton's having a party, I think.
You look nice.
Okay.
I love you so much.
Okay, Mom.
Okay.
Go.
Hey!
Mr. Richards.
Hi, Steve Butler.
Steve, it's a pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
And call me Gerry, for God's sake.
Oh? Great.
Anything to drink?
Steve?
Uh... A cup of coffee.
For you, Gerry?
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks, Lynn.
Well, listen, I appreciate you sitting down with me here.
I know you're busy, but I... Oh, yeah, yeah.
I just thought it'd be a good idea for you and I to get together before the town hall tomorrow so that we can get to know each other.
Of course!
Look, as the senior member of the supervisors board, thank you for sitting down with me.
I appreciate it.
Well...
Pretty exciting, all this natural gas stuff.
It is very exciting.
Whole lot of money down there.
That is also true.
How much, you think?
How much money you think we got down there?
Well, you know, Global's research team hasn't finished their analysis yet. But I think it could be as much as 15 to 20 million dollars.
Is that right?
I mean, it could be, yeah.
Thank you.
Well, listen, I've...
I've been doing a little research about all this.
Oh, good.
Gone online a little bit, and...
Well, I've read all these rumblings how natural gas possibly contaminates water sources?
You know, killing crops and whatnot.
Yeah, you know, I've read all that stuff too.
There's stories of people lighting their water on fire.
People getting sick.
Now, Steve, that sounds nasty.
Well, well, there are a lot of scare tactics at play here, and...
Oh, look, I...
I have a responsibility to protect these people.
To ensure their safety.
Yes.
And to be honest...
Well, I'm just not so sure I'm too comfortable telling my constituents to allow you folks to come into our town.
No matter how much money you have.
Okay.
Well, Mr. Richards, because there's...
Now...
I know that you folks have quite the operation in the works here.
With plans to set up throughout the state. Hmm?
Yeah.
Well, I'd hate to be the guy to jeopardize all that for ya.
To lead this one little podunk town to reject your company.
To reject natural gas.
Well, I can't even imagine what that would do to you guys.
Especially if word of this got out, you know, in the papers, on the news.
It's 30,000.
What's that?
I can offer you $30,000.
Can I get you anything else?
You know what, Lynn, I think we're done here.
Just the check, please.
"The Marcellus Shale, estimated at two trillion dollars, with billions in potential tax revenue to individual states."
Google.
First one that came up, first sentence.
Now, you wanna rethink that joke of a number you mentioned earlier? Hmm?
Mr. Richards, I'm just being straight with you.
It's simple math.
Best case scenario, there's $30 million under your town.
0.1% of that is $30,000.
That's what I'm authorized to offer you.
I'm also telling you it's a one-time offer.
Don't get up.
Don't do that.
I've been at this table before and it does not end well.
Look, I don't fault you for trying, but I'm telling you.
Don't do this.
Because we will walk away.
We always do.
And after every single town within three states has signed up for this, and the blows of this economy are almost unbearable, we're gonna come back.
And we're gonna offer you nothing.
We will offer this town nothing.
Every contract we've signed, every piece of the pie we've offered, it all goes away.
And we buy this place for nothing.
Now, please.
Let some other guy belast
I got it.
Thank you.
So, I'll see you tomorrow?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Geez!
You want me to leave the whole bottle?
They allow you to do that?
Hey, Jesse, three more, please.
Jesus Christ! The two of you.
I don't know what your problem is.
It's my birthday.
I... I have no excuse.
Let me guess.
40, married, marketing, two kids.
38, stripper/waitress, but born to be a singer.
Fuck you!
I'm a teacher!
No, no, I was talking about me.
You wanna see a dance?
It's 100 bucks.
They wouldn't give you 30.
No, you haven't seen my moves.
Okay, all right, now you're creeping me out.
I'm Steve.
Alice.
Wow, you're going pretty big for a school night, Alice.
It's my birthday.
Oh, right, right.
Well, actually tomorrow.
So they just give you your day off? You know, for your birthday?
Or do you have to, like, tell the kids you have a stomach bug?
Okay, first off, I resent the implication that I can't hold my liquor.
And secondly, we watch videos sometimes for the first two periods.
Just sometimes, right?
Smart.
So... What's your story?
What brings you to our booming metropolis?
Oh, I'm actually from a small town myself, so this kinda feels like home.
Oh, yeah? Where's that?
Eldridge, Iowa.
You're a Buckeye!
That's Ohio. Mmm.
It's the same thing.
Okay, no offense taken.
Alice?
Let's go.
Hey, what are we doing?
We drinking or not?
Nice to meet you, Alice.
So you're not gonna even buy a birthday girl a birthday drink?
No, I think that would communicate the wrong thing.
You're an asshole!
No, no, I'm...
Of course I'll buy you a drink.
No, forget it. You blew it.
You missed your chance.
Wait now.
That's it?
Alice, come on.
So how long you gonna be in town?
Yeah, a bit.
"A bit"?
Oh, my God, you are a horrible liar!
I'm not lying.
You wanna give a girl a real birthday present?
Sure, yeah.
Jesse, we're playing Absolut Madness.
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
What now?
What's Absolut Madness?
It's pretty much what it sounds like.
You and Jesse drink four shots in four minutes, and if you can get closer to the bull's-eye on that dartboard, then we drink for free and you get your Polaroid on the wall.
That's not at all what it sounds like.
All right, I'm in.
No, I'll tell you what. Okay, hang on.
What if we double it, all right?
I'll do eight shots in eight minutes, and if I win, everybody at this bar gets to drink for free.
All right.
All right.
You're on.
Come on.
Hey, my name's Steve.
I'm hopefully gonna get everybody here drunk tonight for free.
All right, Absolut Madness, here we go.
Come on, Steve.
You can do it, darlin'.
That's it.
I got it, I got it!
Oh, thank God, you're still kinda handsome.
You're late.
What?
Your phone hasn't stopped buzzing for the last half hour.
Shit!
Oh, shit.
I had a really great time.
Did you?
Huh? Yeah.
You know, I mean...
Nothing happened, Steve.
Well, actually, you did kiss me before you threw up the first time.
That's gross.
Sorry.
I was gonna let you sleep in your car, but you couldn't remember which one was yours.
Uh, no.
I... I didn't drive.
Well, then it's a good thing I didn't let you sleep in your car.
Um... Well, could I take your number or...
Well, you're gonna be around for a bit, right?
It's not that big of a town.
You'll see me again.
Okay.
Is the...
The front door is...
At the front of the house.
When you get there, you're gonna see a knob...
Okay.
You turn that knob...
Yeah, too early for that.
I'm just...
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Happy birthday.
What do you mean, "you were burned"?
Why were you using an iron?
So he asked you to do it?
No, I highly doubt that it's burned off, Danny.
What did the nurse say?
Throwing hand or catching hand?
So you're gonna play this weekend?
Just five minutes.
What do you mean, "pitching"?
Danny, when did the coach say that?
That's fantastic!
No, no, no, that was just Steve.
I'm at work.
Okay, folks, if you could find your seats, please, we'll get started.
Thank you.
I can't believe you went out.
We didn't get home from dinner until 9:30.
She was really cool, actually.
I think you would've liked her.
I don't think you should be making statements like that just yet.
Some of you may even have family or friends who've had natural gas come to their town.
In which case, I'm sure you're aware...
Name?
Alice... of what a life-changing opportunity...
Alice?
Was she elderly?
...that we will be bringing natural gas to McKinley.
How do they get the gas?
Frank.
How are ya?
Listen...
What is that?
Lemonade.
Yeah?
Is it good?
It's fantastic.
It's fresh squeezed.
There's a kid selling it out there.
She is cleaning up!
You want some?
No.
There are these rock deposits underground, deep under... Miles underground.
And they create these drills that go down two or three miles and the breaking of that shale is what actually releases the gas.
It's called fracking.
Excuse me?
The process is calling fracking.
That's right. That's right, Frank.
Now if you'd let me finish, please, we have a basket...
I would encourage all of you, when you go home, to Google that word and see what you find.
Unfortunately, it's not nearly as simple as what Supervisor Richards has just laid out.
Frank, I'm sure we all appreciate the point you're trying to make, but there's no decision to be made here.
We need this.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But this thing here, it may not be the saving grace that you all want it to be.
Now Gerry started this thing off by saying, "Natural gas coming in here is lifesaving."
And it is.
It's a clean and efficient resource.
But the way we go about getting it is some dirty business.
Frank, with all clue respect, I think you're out of your league.
And the potential for error is just too high.
Thank you, Frank.
And there are people all over the country whose water is being contaminated...
- Hey!
Hey, hey!
- Okay.
Frank, I have absolutely had enough of this.
We don't have the time to have this conversation here.
If you wanna come down to...
I'm late here. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt you, Mr...
Yates.
My name is Frank Yates.
Mr. Yates, are you with an environmental group?
No.
No?
Well, what line of work are you in, sir?
I'm a teacher at the high school.
A teacher?
I teach science.
What about you, Mr...
Okay, yeah, I deserved that.
Steve Butler is my name.
I'm a consultant here with Global.
I only caught the tail end of what you were saying, but you seem like someone who's done his homework.
Could I ask you, though, where'd you get your information?
Mr. Butler, you and I both know the information I've been talking about is vast and detailed.
You're probably right. I'm certainly...
I'm not the guy with all the answers.
Well, then you'd be the perfect guy for them to send here to deny everything.
Well, look, I'm not gonna deny that this issue has been made pretty complicated by a few companies who've had their share of incidents.
But, we've been fracking in this country for over 50 years.
This is not a new issue, this is not a new technology.
But Global is being sued, isn't that true, Steve?
Yeah, that's true. That's true.
Just like any other company our size, in any other industry.
And the way we handle those lawsuits is we stand up to 'em.
Because we're not in the business of handing out free money to people who make false claims against us.
And the thing to take away here is, how many times we've lost.
And that's none.
We've never, ever lost one of these cases.
Well, you can't lose a game that's still being played.
Look, Steve, I'm sure that even you can admit that fracking is far from a perfect process.
Perfect?
Of course not.
But given the government regulations that we have to adhere to, and all the hoops we've jumped through, it's pretty close to perfect.
Steve.
The only reason that natural gas is so big right now is because it finally is the clean alternative to these dangerous industries like coal and oil.
If it's such an incredible alternative, why did they have to have a man standing off to the side of the room to make sure we all go for it?
Seems to me it should be able to sell itself.
But you're not the man with the answers.
So, who is?
Because I still have questions.
Well, I'd like to answer all of those questions.
But...
I'd just like everybody to keep something in mind here.
There's no such thing as a neutral position here.
If you're against this, you're for coal and oil.
Period.
I mean, unless we talk about cutting consumption.
And so far that's a conversation none of us wanna have.
Steve, I just came here to point out that this issue is a bit more complicated than it seems.
Well, yeah. I mean, you've certainly done that.
Great, I think we should take a vote.
Well...
In a couple of weeks, when we've all had time to think this whole thing through, I think we should put it to a vote.
With all due respect, the people in this town really need this.
They need this.
And quite frankly, I don't think that anybody here is gonna be swayed by one man.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
These people and I came here to say we strongly believe this is not in the best interest of this town.
Hey, Gerry.
Gerry, I'm sorry. These kids have regionals coming up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Stan, sure thing.
Well... Look, Frank, this isn't everybody.
I mean, not even half the town is here today.
Exactly!
And I think all those people would hate to be left out of such an important decision.
Frank...
Gerry, Gerry, let's face it.
We both know that money can lead very often to bad decisions.
You've seen the same numbers I have, and with the recent figures on deposits in this area at 150 million dollars.
Let's all take some time to think it through.
150 million dollars?
Those are the latest numbers out of the university.
Well... 150 million dollars is a lot of money.
Let's have a vote!
Say, three weeks time.
We're adjourned!
Asshole.
Holy shit.
Okay, calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
"Natural gas isn't perfect."
What were you thinking?
And that politician. Why was he so pissed off?
Because I told them that the real number was 30 million dollars.
Jesus Christ.
I mean...
Well, once again, you came in below the price point.
Was it worth it?
I'm sorry.
You know what, Steven?
Listen to me.
I don't give a shit about your numbers or your promotion.
My kid is in fucking Houston with his stupid fucking dad.
This is a job, and then I go home.
I'm sorry, Sue.
Do not say, "I'm sorry, Sue" one more time.
All right.
The plan's the same.
Nothing's changed.
But starting now, we close everyone.
I don't care if they can fit one well or 20 wells.
We go door to door and we lease it all.
They still need the money.
The politician was buckling,
Steven stepped in and tried to put the fire out.
This Yates guy, he's just a wild card.
Yeah, he's the high school science teacher here, you know.
Uh-huh. Well, research pulled him up.
He's a hell of a lot more than that, Steve.
Frank Yates. MA, engineering, MIT.
PhD from Cornell in Physics.
Come on.
Jesus Christ, the guy did R and D for Boeing for 32 years?
He's retired, Steve!
He's teaching for fun!
Okay. We're pulling it. We're pulling you now.
No!
Absolutely not.
They take us out of it, they put somebody else in it.
It looks like we're running scared.
Where is everybody? Where'd you go?
I'm here, uh...
Look, I can have this whole place committed before this guy gets one more supporter.
Period. Okay?
Just give me the chance.
I don't have to tell you how important all this is.
This is all or nothing.
We understand each other?
Yeah, I understand.
Coffee, handsome?
Uh, yeah. Two to go, please.
Cream and sugar?
Yeah, please.
God!
Put that away, it's on me.
Thank you.
Don't you worry about Frank Yates, darlin'.
We all know it's not true.
Hey, did research say anything about an environmental presence here?
No. None of the usual suspects.
Nothing locally.
Uh, Mr. Yates?
Yes?
Hi!
My name is Dustin Noble, from a small environmental group called Superior Athena.
What can I do for you?
I heard about the vote, and I'd like to do anything I can to help.
Oh, well, look, I...
I don't think anybody here considers themselves to be part of some great environmental revolution.
I have a pretty good feeling we could win this.
But with all due respect, sir, you've picked a much bigger fight than you think...
So you have to win.
And I have the one thing you don't.
Evidence.
That's it.
Wow, are you a little stoned or is there a storm coming I didn't know about?
We have to stay a little longer than we thought.
Not necessarily a bad thing.
What happened to your window?
Ah, I got into a bit of a heated discussion last night at the bar.
I'm assuming it's not a coincidence.
A heated discussion?
About what?
You're kidding.
Do I look worried?
I own a gun shop.
Oh, come on.
You sing?
What?
You look like you'd be a singer.
What are you talking about?
Girls I was in high school with, who sang in the choir, they all had hair like yours.
Well, I was in the church choir but...
Told you.
It's in the hair.
Think about it.
Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, Cher.
They all had good hair.
That's a very interesting theory, Rob, but...
I no longer sing in public.
What?
I mean, what's the point of having good hair if you don't sing in public?
What do you mean?
Like karaoke?
We don't call it that.
It's just open mic.
And you tell the band what you want to sing, they play it, you sing.
Not gonna happen.
Excuse me.
Hey!
Hey!
Excuse me. Hey, man!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, buddy!
Hey! Hey, man!
Come on.
Okay, look.
This whole door to door thing just isn't gonna cut it.
If you wanna sell to these people, you gotta get 'em all together or not get 'em at all.
I mean, you're a pro.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Show your face tonight.
Make yourself seem friendly.
Embarrass yourself a bit.
Hey, did you see a guy in there?
I'm gonna let you figure out how stupid that sounded.
I think there's an environmental presence.
Really?
Well, I don't know.
That guy. Right there.
I... I don't know.
Maybe.
That's okay, don't panic.
We'll figure it out.
I gotta get an outfit.
You think this guy is handsome.
What?
No, you just look nice.
Oh, shut up.
Ooh, Buddy's Place.
Scene of the crime.
Is this where you tried to pick up that old lady?
Alice.
She's very nice.
Hey, am I sitting with you?
No.
I'm sitting with Rob.
Who's Rob?
The handsome guy.
Oh, Jesus.
Wait.
What song are you gonna sing?
Sue.
Hey!
Hey!
I signed you up.
You ready?
Nice.
I'm not entirely sure you should be drinking.
Hey!
Alice.
Let's try this again.
Steve.
Steve.
It's very nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you, Alice.
So...
Looks like you are gonna be staying around for a bit after all.
Right, um...
The town hall meeting, didn't look like it went the way you wanted it to.
Yeah, we were only supposed to be here for two or three days.
Sorry I lied to you.
That's okay.
We don't actually play a game called Absolut Madness.
Jesse's shots were water.
What's Absolut Madness?
In case of emergency only.
See you around, Steve.
Oh, my God.
No.
Jesus.Thought that would go better.
Really?
I thought it was great.
Hey, everybody!
Check, check.
Nope.
That's not a good joke.
It just felt like a much better idea when I was standing alone in the back.
Sing something, man!
Oh, God! Definitely...
Definitely you don't want that.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm new in town, I just came in.
My name is Dustin Noble,
I work for a small environmental company called Athena.
And I...
Yeah. I know. I know.
The reason why I wanted to talk to you is 'cause I'm actually from a small farming community myself in Nebraska.
My family's 5th generation dairy.
And, uh...
Well, the farm is gone.
Everything we had is gone.
What happened was, in 2008 my dad found 12 dead cows out by a creek about a half a mile from our house.
And then, in April about 70% of those cows were either sick or dead.
And by Christmas he had defaulted on his payments and the bank took his house.
The land just died.
It just... It just turned brown and died.
And it made it really easy to see the only things left standing, which were these giant green wells that said Global on them.
Now, these guys at Global, they're real clever.
They have this fine print in the leases they make you sign that says you can't talk about it in a court of law, but...
Hell, I'm pretty sure they don't say anything about telling a couple of friends at a bar.
We had the farm in our family for 150 years, but it only took nine months to lose it.
So, I heard you were taking a vote.
And, uh, I had to come down here because you have no idea how important this is.
And I promise you this is not an environmental conspiracy.
This is our lives.
Now it's happened and...
Hell!
It's happened to one of us, it can happen to all of us.
So, I guess I'm just here to say, my name is Dustin Noble, and I'm here for you.
So take one of these pamphlets on the way out...
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Come on, Springsteen, baby.
Sing it!
Oh, yikes!
No.
No.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You have no idea how hard that song is.
It's way higher than you think, no!
Really?
Wow.
Okay. Uh...
I've got a big day tomorrow.
Come on, I need it.
This is gross.
That's him.
That's the guy.
I'll tell you what. If I'm gonna do this I need the help.
So, let's do it for real.
Everybody up! Let's go.
Let's go...
I can handle it.
Hey, none of what that guy just said is true.
I'm not a bad guy.
"Global go home." What a crock of shit.
God!
Can we go inside at least?
It's fucking freezing out here.
I mean, how do we know the guy's even staying here?
Where else would he stay, Steven?
I mean, none of this shit can be true, right? No.
Of course, not.
We would've heard about it.
They're not going to send us in blind.
I should have just confronted him at the bar.
In front of the whole town?
On open mic night?
Okay.
Hello!
Hey!
Play nice. I got it.
I got it.
Hey, man!
What's going on? Hey!
How's it going?
Good, good.
What are you doing here?
What's that?
What are you doing here?
I mean, Athena?
I've never even heard of that company.
What kind of name is that?
Uh, it's Greek originally.
Athena's the goddess of wisdom.
Dude, I fucking know who Athena is.
Oh, okay.
'Cause you just said that you didn't.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Are you joking?
I'm Steve.
Hi, Steve.
Yeah, I'm the guy you were just talking shit about at open mic night!
Oh, wow!
You're from Global.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know who you're dealing with here?
I mean, is this like a joke to you?
I mean, is this some game for you and your stoner buddies?
Yeah. Oh, I know exactly who I'm dealing with.
Steve Butler.
See, I know everything about your company.
I know what you do, I know how to beat it.
You know how to...
Wait, no.
By telling bullshit sob stories and singing fucking Springsteen?
Listen. You seem like a really nice kid, that doesn't understand that he is in way over his head on this one.
We've already signed more than enough leases to start development in this town.
Oh, man.
It's too late.
I really wouldn't underestimate these people.
I don't.
Well, I know you think what you're doing is right, and I really admire that commitment. But your presence here only confuses people.
But we appreciate what you're doing, and we would like to make a donation to your organization.
Your cooperation is valuable to us.
You gotta be kidding me.
Forget it. Forget it.
Put on the brake, put on the brake.
It's stupid.
It doesn't even make sense.
Great, yeah. You got it.
Yeah.
Okay. Check out the horses.
They do seem small.
Next to the goat, right?
Yeah. They should be bigger next to the goat.
Right?
You're right!
That...
You know, unless the goats are big.
Come on!
Those goats are normal.
Holy shit.
What?
Holy shit!
What's going on here?
"Global go home."
Global go...
Son of a bitch!
He made signs?
Hold on, no, no.
There he is.
Pull over.
Pull over!
I'll be around. Let me know if you need anything.
Okay. Thank you.
What are you doing, man?
Hey, Steve!
Hey!
Hello!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Well, I'm just telling these people the truth.
We had an agreement, man.
Did we?
Yeah, we sure as shit did.
Listen, Steve.
I came here for a reason.
Oh, my God.
What?
I gotta do what I came here to do.
Okay.
You took our money.
Yeah.
Oh, but I did put that donation to good use! So thank you!
Hey, Sue!
Okay, if it's all a joke, great.
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with here?
We're a nine billion dollar company. Okay?
Do you know what we're capable of?
DO you?
Because all I see here is you and me, Steve.
And one of us is a lot more confident than the other one.
One of us is about to get punched in the fucking face.
Steve, look, I know this must be really frustrating for you, and I'm sorry.
You're doing all the things you've done in the past, it's just not working this time.
It's not working?
I have 60% of this land bought and paid for.
It's over.
Steve, you can have 80% of this land bought.
That's only 40% of the vote.
We're not fighting for land, Steve.
We're fighting for people.
You're a fucking...
- These people need help. Okay?
- Steven.
I'm here to give it to 'em. What are you doing?
Steve, you're wrong.
All right?
These people have changed.
It's not just about the money anymore.
Get in the car, Steven.
Listen, none of this is your fault, okay?
It's just...
It's just time.
It's just time for what?
For what, man?
What are you selling?
Look at you.
I'll see ya around, Steve.
Yeah, let's just run everything on rainbows and happy thoughts.
Dipshit.
God damn.
I mean, like, what is his truck running on, right?
Bio-fuel.
You kidding?
It is really? Yes!
Like French fry grease.
Asshole.
Well, hello!
My name's Dustin.
Hi, Dustin!
So well behaved.
How many of you guys live on a farm?
Whoa!
All right!
Me too.
And guess what?
This is my farm.
That's not a real farm. What?
There's, uh, Henley. There's a ton of them there.
We should just start there.
Fine.
Wherever.
God damn it!
Pretend that this is the dirt underneath my farm.
All right?
And this is all the water that we had.
All the water we had to drink, all the water the cows had to drink, all the water the puppies and kittens had to drink.
All the water for the fish in the rivers.
Hey, there, sir. Good afternoon.
Can I have a moment of your time?
I know why you're here and we don't need it.
When they do start drilling, they go right into the ground.
Like this.
Right?
Seems pretty simple?
Well, they don't have really cool drills, like some of your dads do in the garage.
They have huge big ones like this.
There he is!
Hey!
Hey! I've been waitin' all day for you folks!
Sorry, I don't think, uh...
Yeah, Paul Geary.
442 Henley.
Yeah, come on in, man.
Come on up here. I got some coffee brewing.
Yup!
There you are. I got you. Okay.
In order to use a drill this big, it needs a little help.
So, they shoot all this water and all this sand into the ground with the drill.
And with all that they also shoot chemicals.
No. Doesn't look scary?
So what I'm gonna do is I'll just leave that with you and just read that over...
I'm here.
I'll sign it right now.
Uh, no, no.
You should read it over, um, and I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna be in town for a couple of days.
But they don't use just one chemical.
They use all of 'em.
All at the same time.
And some chemicals they don't even tell us about.
So, when they go to do that drilling...
Let me show you what happens.
Disgusting.
Ugh!
Gross! What is that?
Hey, let me ask you something.
What do you think?
What do you mean?
What? I mean the well, that's what I mean.
So when they finally start drilling, there's no way to tell where all those chemicals are gonna go.
So they start mixing with the dirt and the sand and the water.
You think it's going to be a gusher?
Is that what you call it?
A gusher?
Well, we're gonna have to do some tests and...
No!
Come on, man.
There's a whole process we have to go through.
I'm not talking about test.
Between me and you.
We're gonna be partners.
Come on, you could tell me.
I ain't gonna tell nobody.
What's your gut feeling?
You know, you seem like a lucky guy.
Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.
All right.
We appreciate you guys coming by, all right.
You want me to show you how bad it is to have all that dirty water come back up to the land in a pretty farm like mine?
Yeah.
Let's take a look.
All right, lemme show you.
Oh, no.
I don't think... Don't worry about it, I got it.
Um... Trust me. All right.
Ready?
- Whoa!
- That's so cool.
Wait, wait, wait.
Why do you think it's cool?
We had all these beautiful animals like cows and horses and chickens.
We even had turtles.
What's this guy's name?
Trigger!
This is Trigger.
Hey, Trigger.
Now, do you think Trigger could survive in my farm?
No!
You don't think so?
No.
All right, let's try it.
No!
Gosh, doll!
We struck it big right here. Huh?
This little two acre lot.
All right, there you go.
Take one. Stick 'em anywhere you can.
Get in trouble!
No.
Don't get in trouble.
All right, so I will...
I will see you around.
Great.
All right.
Bye. See ya.
God damn it! It's your birthday every day, isn't it?
Oh, stop it.
- What's he got?
- 1.8 acres.
How much?
Five thousand.
And I told him 15%.
Smart.
Let's just go.
Oh, come on.
The guy's gonna get a free 5,000 bucks.
Shit.
Don't say anything!
You ever been in a tree?
You ever slept in a tree? Hey, Lynn.
Two dollars. Yeah.
All right.
That's all I remember.
Well, anyway, you've never been there.
So I wake up, 6:00 a.m., on the ground.
Just on the ground, I didn't know I'd fallen out of the tree.
It was like this, all the way down, bang!
I kid you not. I kid you not.
Whoo!
Lynn, thank you. I'm gonna bounce out of here.
Steve!
There he is.
Morning.
Whoa, whoa, you all right?
Adam? We almost lost him.
It's not that funny, my gosh.
You make me feel good, I'm not gonna lie.
Yeah, great, so I'm the bad guy.
I mean, never mind the fact that we use it.
Here, I got it.
You know, we spend a billion dollars a day to fight for that stuff overseas? When we've got this huge resource right here in our backyard.
I mean, that's insane.
Now, I got to deal with some hippie running around...
I mean, I don't even know what that guy is saying.
Mr. Butler, you ain't got to hold that.
Listen, you seem like a nice enough man so I'm gonna be straight with you so as to not waste your time.
That little boy right there, he lost his father, my brother, six years ago in Fallujah.
So you ain't got to lecture me on the whole foreign oil dependency routine.
But, let me ask you a question, Steve.
If I do this, what am I telling that boy?
What do I tell him about this farm that my daddy gave me and his daddy gave him?
What am I telling him about what his daddy went to the desert to fight for?
See, Steve, you and I both know the only reason that you're here is 'cause we're poor.
How many wells you got up there in Manhattan?
Or Pittsburgh?
How about Philadelphia?
It's okay, I get it.
That's what us folks are here for, right?
You about ready, Blake?
Listen, Steve.
You ain't never gonna get what you came here to take from me.
And to be honest with you, I don't even like the fact that you're here trying.
Two minutes, Blake.
You can see yourself out.
Turn around.
Well.
We definitely have the space.
Food and games to the left, put the animals and the bathrooms to the right.
I bet we could even do a tractor-pull back there, behind the Ferris wheel, right next to the...
You know, the whirly thing.
That's it.
I mean, what am I missing?
I don't know.
Oh, come on, Sue.
I have never even been to a town fair.
I am not P.R. This is for the backup team.
We are the backup team!
Trust me, you want to win?
This is how you do it.
Look, if we can't sign everyone to a lease, at least we'll let them know what it feels like to have some money.
Now, what am I missing?
Bouncy castles.
Congratulations.
You just got a job in P.R.
Well, hello there.
Are you the owner of this place?
Oh, good.
I was starting to feel left out.
Come on in.
Quite a house.
Yeah, for such a single lady. Huh?
I didn't say that.
Yeah, you didn't have to.
Ah, I was expecting you to have way more cats.
No.
It was a really big deal for me to move back here.
I was living in the city.
When my dad died, they asked me if I wanted to sell, and...
You know, it had been in my family for generations and I didn't want to be the one to give it up.
It's beautiful.
Yeah.
You know, according to our records, you do have 82 acres.
I could give you a couple of tips to boost your crop.
That's not for me, that's for my students.
Really?
Yeah, I bring them out here and I walk them through the process.
You're teaching farming kids how to farm?
I'm not teaching them how to farm.
I'm sorry, no. You're teaching farming kids how to garden?
No, I'm teaching them how to take care of something.
All right.
Give me the pitch.
You came all the way out here.
Nah, it's getting late.
Are you serious?
No, it's a whole thing. I mean, like, you know,
I have a PowerPoint presentation and there's an interpretive dance section.
It takes a while.
Give me a little bit of it.
Just the dance.
I can come back.
Hey.
Someone told me...
Well, I heard... You're from Iowa.
And your daddy, your daddy, he was a farmer.
Grandfather.
What'd you say?
Doesn't matter.
I'm sorry, you got something you want to say?
Then say it.
Really?
Yeah!
You guys just fucking baffle me, how you just don't get it.
Yeah?
Why don't you tell me?
'Cause I'm really curious about what it is that I don't get.
Money.
Money.
I'm not talking about little pay increases, I'm talking about "fuck you" money.
You don't want to apply for college loans for your kid?
This money says, "Fuck you, loans."
You're worried about car payments, "Fuck you, payments."
The bank is gonna come and foreclose on your farm,
"Fuck you, bank."
"Fuck you" money is the ultimate liberator, and underneath your town, there's "fuck you" money.
So think long and hard about all those brutal days working.
And the goddamn checks you get from whatever frozen peas company is buying.
Think about how much you made on your best day and then think real hard about how much you made on your worst, 'cause, let's be honest with each other, they're all looking like that more and more nowadays, right?
These people?
This town?
This life?
It's dying or damn near dead.
And you all see it coming and you just don't get the fuck out of the way.
Why?
Why?
Pride?
Of what?
What do you got?
Shit, how much of it is even yours?
I bet all of you are getting subsidy checks from the government. Right?
Now, when those stop coming, when all that help stops coming and you've got nowhere left to go, you're gonna remember this conversation and remember the guy who came in and looked you in the eye and said, "Fuck you."
You're an asshole.
Absolut Madness.
Alice?
No, but I'm in room 23 if you're desperate.
Jesus, Sue.
I'm just calling to make sure you're behaving yourself.
We got a big day tomorrow.
Yeah, I got it.
You gotta get some sleep, Steven.
I got it!
Because we have a big day tomorrow.
Alice...
Thank you.
Hello there.
Are you the owner of this place?
No...
No?
Well, how come you're doing all the work?
It's set in stone now.
That's it.
No turnin' back.
Hey, hold on. I got something for you.
Don't jerk us off.
No, ma'am.
Hey, look at this right here.
Special occasions.
It's the only time it comes out.
Oh, yeah.
This right here's the good stuff.
Thank you.
To us being partners.
I've been passing out these flyers for two and a half hours.
I'm gonna die.
I don't know how that Athena guy does it.
Is that a donkey?
Hey, where you going?
I gotta dig out the courses.
What courses?
The pig races.
I don't like that you just said that without a smile on your face.
Are you okay?
I just want to finish and get the hell out of here.
This is gonna close 'em.
Don't drink that!
Hey.
Hey.
You guys look like you could use some help.
Yeah. Yeah. Great.
If y'all could help with the food tents, that'd be great.
You got it.
Thanks.
Let's go.
Yeah!
You want a beer?
Lots of beer.
Hey, Steve.
Hey, Jess.
How you doin'.
Can I get a couple pitchers?
Nice work, Steve.
That town fair idea, that was.
.. That was smart.
Well, thank you, Dustin.
Bet that was pretty hard for you to say.
You like your job, Steve?
You love what you do?
Yeah.
On days like this? Yeah, I do.
Thanks, Jess.
Hey, get my friend a beer as well.
One of those fancy imported ones.
Sure.
Maybe, like, a granola bar to go with it.
I'll see you, man.
You have what it takes, Steve?
Thank you.
Do you think you have what it takes?
Oh, to beat you?
Yeah. Absolutely.
Well. You just might.
Hey, man. I'll drink to that.
Okay.
Hey, there she is.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
All right.
Hey, Steve, thanks again for the beer.
That was really sweet.
I'm gonna take it to go.
Hope you guys have a great night!
Thanks, Jess.
I'm really looking forward to the fair tomorrow.
Should be fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Steve!
What up, man?
Paul?
Hey, what you think about my new ride?
I figured I'd treat myself.
That's your car? Yeah.
That's my car.
I went all the way to Barton to get it.
Come on, I'll buy. I got it.
We lost.
Let's just go, huh?
Stop.
I don't have the clutch in.
Stop it, Steven.
God damn it!
Whoa.
Nasty.
Nice day!
Mmm. That is so good.
Mmm. I'm stuffed.
It's great.
Thank you.
You're more than welcome.
I'd love the recipe for this... This cake.
Would you let me take that home?
That'd be great, Arlene.
You cook, Sue?
My son, my son's a good cook.
He used to pull the chair up to the counter when he was little and help me stir things up.
Now he's the chef and I'm the sous-chef.
Um, I don't know where I put it, don't know where I put it...
Here's his picture.
Here you go.
Like, I get him to help me and sometimes he talks to me about stuff.
Look at this.
Oh, yeah.
Say...
You know, Frank's dad died when Frank was only eight.
His mom always talked about the clarity of purpose.
You would understand exactly what you have to do every day.
What about you, Steve?
Where did you say you were from?
Eldridge.
Oh, yeah?
You still have family up there?
No.
Wait a minute, you say Eldridge?
They had a plant up there.
A Caterpillar plant.
Yeah, that's right. I had a friend, um, from Boeing, lived up there.
I remember that.
Wasn't pretty.
When they closed that, that was it, really.
The town was just hollowed out.
What, no pretty lady to hand out free money to save you?
Yeah, what would you have done then, Steven?
I'd move so fuckin' fast.
Just take the money and leave.
Just leave.
And where would we all go?
Excuse me.
Miniature horses.
Oh, my God.
Thought we were losing our minds.
A lot of us breed them up here.
Some people consider them an abomination.
Big industry here.
What do you get for it?
Not enough, Steve.
You're a good man, Steve.
You have so many of the qualities we need more of these days.
I just wish...
I just wish you weren't doing this.
You came here and offered us money, figuring you were helping us.
All we had to do to get it was be willing to scorch the earth under our feet.
We have nothing left to sell.
We can't afford to buy anything.
Don't get me wrong, I'm no better than my neighbors.
Hell, I need the money, too.
I guess I'm lucky...
Lucky to be old enough to have a shot at dying with my dignity.
I'm worried for us, Steve.
Let me know when you're ready to head back.
Excuse me, sir? Steve?
There's a package here for you.
Holy shit.
Sue.
We got him.
We win! We win.
We win. We win.
The guy's whole sob story is fucking bullshit.
What are you talking about?
Research did a whole check. Look.
This guy is fucking lying. Okay.
What'd they say?
What is that a picture of?
Uh, a picture of his family's farm.
Okay. And where's the farm located?
What?
Where's the farm?
Nebraska.
Great. What's that?
A silo.
Look again.
Holy shit.
It's a fucking lighthouse!
Holy shit.
Now geography was never really my strong suit, but I'm pretty sure there are no oceans in Nebraska.
He made the whole thing up.
And when the town finds out that he lied to them... That he was manipulating them in order to get their vote.
Oh, they're gonna have a fucking field day with this guy.
We win.
Gerry Richards.
Yeah, Steve.
What?
Jesus.
I've already been to see Richards.
Everyone in town's gonna know by morning.
I just... I wanted you to hear from me.
You deserve someone who tells you the truth.
What're you doing here, Steve?
I'm not a bad guy.
Good night.
Alice...
If I had asked you out?
I would have said yes.
Good night.
Thank you.
You know, what you did is going to hurt a lot of people.
What were you thinking, man?
How does somebody even do that?
You came in here and based your entire case against us on a lie?
All right, Steve.
I already talked to Richards. Just...
Let me go.
I mean, did you think we wouldn't find out?
You just guaranteed we win.
You know, you're gonna lose.
Yeah, it might not be Athena that does it, but one of these days, you're gonna lose.
I just hope I'm there to see it!
I guarantee it's not gonna be Athena that does it.
I mean, do you even know how bad this is for you?
Athena's done. Done. It's over for you.
What else was I supposed to do?
I mean, it's not a fair fight, Steve.
I'm out there doing what? Handing out flyers and posters?
This vote meant everything and I had to do it.
No, you didn't.
You didn't. You fucked up.
You tell me, Steve. What do I do?
In a world where no one cares.
Where a company like yours can just go into Lafayette, Louisiana and do something like that.
Or McKinley.
Or the next place.
Because let's be honest, it's just gonna happen again and again and again.
So you tell me, what am I supposed to do?
I never told you this farm was in Lafayette, Louisiana...
What?
What are you talking about?
I never told you this happened in Lafayette, Louisiana.
How could you know that?
Steve, these people needed my help.
Okay? They called me.
No.
No.
No, you said yourself, we're too clever for that.
These deals we have with these people and the fine print, they don't call anybody.
Certainly not an environmentalist.
Okay, Steve.
Dustin?
How'd you know where this farm was?
Dustin?
Fuck.
That was stupid.
I should've just got in my car.
What?
We were never gonna let them vote, Steve.
You're with Global.
Jesus Christ.
You're with Global.
Did you really think they were going to leave something like this in your hands?
After you let them bring it to a vote?
Steve, companies like Global, they don't rely on anyone.
That's how they win.
They win by controlling every outcome.
And they do that by playing both sides.
But, no.
I was...
What?
What did you do?
What is it you think you did?
I did everything.
Athena is me.
This story is me.
Getting you that package to give to the politician, that's me.
You only did what I let you do.
But you did a good job.
Now it's over.
We win.
And this farm...
Stay with me. All right?
This farm, that doesn't matter.
They've already dealt with this.
This is done.
They said this was a false claim.
Did they?
You're gonna want to stop asking questions now, Steve.
You're at the big kids table.
But listen, it has been fun.
I think you're really a good choice for this.
You'll do a good job.
Good luck in New York.
Funny.
Smart.
We've got about an hour before this game gets started to get the vote in.
Go Pioneers, yeah!
Listen up, here's the way this thing is gonna work.
If your last name starts with the letter A...
Lemonade?
Is it good?
Really good.
You got a real good spot here.
I know.
Wow.
I know.
Uh, mister?
You forgot your change.
Just go ahead and keep it.
The sign says it's only 25 cents.
So... It's only 25 cents.
Oh, oh, one more thing.
Before we get to the vote,
Steve Butler just wanted to say a few words.
I'll be very brief.
I know there's been a lot of talk about this...
This picture.
So, brought it to show everybody.
That's the lighthouse and the ocean.
I was looking at this picture...
Looking at it for a while last night.
For a long while.
And found myself staring at this barn.
The Wood's chipping away and the paint's flaking off there.
Probably from all the salt water in the air.
But it reminded me of my grandfather's barn.
That barn was the bane of my existence.
It was immaculate.
We painted it every other summer.
Just him and me.
I'd ask him, "Why?
Why do we have to do this?"
And he'd look at me and say,
"This is our barn.
Who else is going to do it?"
I used to think the guy was crazy.
And stubborn.
Proud.
But, see. I think...
He was just trying to teach me what it meant to take care of something.
Okay.
Well, you all know that Dustin lied.
Tried to get you to vote the way he wanted you to vote.
See ya.
And that's exactly what he did because you are about to vote exactly as he wants you to vote.
Because Dustin is not an environmentalist.
Dustin works for Global.
They couldn't afford an environmental presence here so they created their own.
They're trying to make this decision for you.
And they're betting that you'll let them.
This is a real farm.
And they told these people exactly what I've told a lot of you. In fact,
I've looked a lot of you right in the eye and told you there's a bunch of money under your feet and we can get it out risk free, guaranteed.
Clearly, that's not true.
I'm sorry.
Look, is this gonna happen here?
I honestly don't believe that it will.
But they know the only reason we're all gathered here is to ask the question, "What if it did?"
And I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to say anymore.
But where we are now,
where we're headed,
we might be betting more than we think.
Everything that we have is on the table now.
And that's just not ours to lose.
But this is still our barn.
Go Pioneers.
Yup.
Okay. Yeah. I understand.
Was that them?
Yes.
You are definitely fired.
And...
They want me in the city tomorrow.
Well, that's...
That's great.
You want a lift somewhere?
What, are you kidding me?
It's open mic night.
It's just a job.
Oh, for God's sakes. Just get some new boots.
Not a chance.
Hey.
Hey.
That's it? Yeah, that's it.
Sorry I can't make the vote.
Oh, I think we'll be okay.
That's that.
That's that.
Are you the owner of this place?
Last season on Falling Skies...
Alien structures are going up over every city that we know about.
They flew here in spaceships and turned kids into slaves.
What's happening to us?
You really think you can deal with those lizards?
Skitters were our us too.
Who do you think they are?
I don't know.
I wish we could use these against them.
We don't have enough people left for a suicide mission.
The harness...
is a process.
And Ben isn't free from it.
They'll call him back...
unless you go with them.
You don't want to do this.
No, I don't.
Tom?
Tom.
Anthony!
Open fire!
Where the hell is our backup?
!
Keep your heads down!
Make every shot count!
Remember the drill, Five-O -- arms, legs, then the cabeza!
You ever think you enjoying these turkey shoots a bit too much, convict?
!
Life hands you lemons...
Go!
...you blow its frigging head off!
Cease fire!
Save your ammo!
Cease fire!
Ben!
Stop shooting!
Captain!
We look good down here!
Get the hell out of there!
We got...eight minutes, tops, before those beamers respond!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Jimmy, stay close!
Ben!
Come on!
We're moving out.
Got one still moving.
- Can't get a shot.
- Well, leave it!
Ben!
Ben!
What the hell are you doing?
There's another one.
I can feel it.
Dad?
Dad!
It's Dad.
Dad?
Dad.
Ben.
Ben.
Hal.
You're alive, thank God.
♪ Falling Skies 2x01 ♪ Worlds Apart Original Air Date on June 17, 2012
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We got beamers on top of us!
Where the hell is Hal and Ben?
!
That wasn't eight minutes!
Looks like the bad guys are growing a brain.
Captain, hold on!
Hold on, Captain!
Got to get him in the back of the truck!
Tom!
He's hurt bad.
Get the back open.
Let's get him in the truck!
Pope, Anthony, get out of here now!
Get him in the back!
Where's he hurt?
Come on!
Hurry up!
Mason?
Where the hell did he come from?
Go, go!
Go, go!
Easy, easy!
Dr. Glass!
Dr. Glass!
Anne!
Somebody get Anne!
Incoming!
Out of the way, people!
Get out of the way!
Let him through!
Easy, easy.
Tom Mason is alive!
Tom?
Is he okay?
Oh, my God.
Tom?
He's been shot.
He lost a lot of blood.
Anne.
Was it a Mech?
Tell Ben it wasn't his fault.
Uh, it was an accident -- friendly fire.
I didn't know!
It was dark.
Ben, I got to go.
Ben, it's okay.
Let's turn him over.
No exit wound.
That means the bullet's still inside. Okay.
Lourdes, I need his pressure.
Uh-huh.
Dad!
Dad!
Hey, buddy.
What happened to him? !
He's been hurt pretty bad, buddy.
But he's gonna be okay, right?
90 over 70.
Start an I.V., okay, and... go get the propofol we found in Fitchburg.
I can't stop the bleeding until I find out where the bullet is, okay?
I have to go in, Tom.
Guys, I know how much you want to be here, but...
She's right.
Come on.
Let's give them some room.
Let's give them some room.
Come on, Ben.
It's all right.
Let's give them some room.
Thanks for that.
I go in blind like this, I could make things worse.
I trust you.
Hey!
I've been here for days!
I want to know about my son!
No!
Don't.
Karen?
Sorry for this, Tom.
I hope you're not afraid.
Whatever you think they've done to me, I'm still Karen.
This way.
You said what they were doing to Ben was a process.
Whatever it is, can it be stopped?
- That's up to you.
- Me?
Tom, it's time to face facts.
They've won.
There's no use prolonging hostilities for either side.
Meaning what?
They're asking for a cease-fire?
No, they're allowing the resistance to surrender.
"Allowing the resistance to surrender"?
Sounds like we've been more trouble than they expected.
Don't overestimate a few small victories.
The resistance is an inconvenience.
They are offering you a gift, Tom -- a chance to have a life, a real life, with Hal and Matt and Ben.
After everything they've done, you expect me to take that on faith?
No.
Not on faith.
Once you hear what they have to offer, I'm sure you'll understand... everything.
So, they finally got the bullet out, but Anne says he's looking pretty weak.
Your father's a fighter, Hal.
I know that firsthand.
Yeah, but you saw the way he looked.
There's no telling what else he's been through.
How's Ben handling it?
He's been keeping to himself.
You know, he's got to feel like hell.
You notice anything else about him?
Look, Ben's fine, all right?
If the Skitters are still pulling his strings, I think they'd make him miss every now and then.
I still want you to keep an eye on him.
Now, I know that you're worried about your father, Hal, but we got a situation here.
Yeah, like how this eight-minute escape window just turned into two.
Those munitions we lucked into allowed us to inflict some serious pain, but these ambushes were supposed to be a holding action till we got new orders.
You're not thinking about backing down, are you?
We haven't heard word one from any of the other units since that attack on Boston.
For all I know, we're the only ones still left in the fight.
And I'm for killing these bastards every chance we get, but we get boxed in, we may not come out.
So we don't get boxed in.
All right?
We're finally drawing blood.
That was the point, right?
Got to hurt them as much as they hurt us.
I'm gonna go get some air.
If anything changes, just come outside.
The girl told us you were a historian before we came.
Karen?
It's not her anymore, is it?
I'm talking to you?
She is allowing me to speak through her.
"Allowing"?
She has no choice.
You took her like you took...
Ben and everything else.
There was no other way.
We've studied you in great detail, Professor.
We've drawn from that to make a proposal that would end hostilities between us.
In exchange for sanctuary, we will set aside a protected area where human survivors will be relocated.
Some kind of prison camp.
A place where you would be allowed to live in peace.
You must be familiar with the concept.
It's taken directly from your own history.
The worst of it.
You can't hand-pick from our darkest moments like Cambodia or Nazi Germany.
Or Nanking, My Lai, the trail of tears.
Please, Professor Mason.
We can think of dozens of more examples.
Be honest.
Oppression is in your nature.
And that is your justification for the murder of billions?
If those atrocities are the worst of us... what does that make you?
The ones who will decide if your world lives or dies.
Ben, I've been looking for you.
I wanted to be by myself for a while.
You heard what happened, right?
Yeah.
I know you didn't mean to hurt dad.
You're going out again.
Got no choice.
Pope and Anthony sent another alien patrol our direction.
We don't ambush them on our terms, they could roll right over us.
It's not fair!
I-I should be going with you.
Okay, you're nowhere near ready.
Because everyone keeps treating me like a little kid.
I'm old enough to fight.
Old enough to know how, at least.
How about this?
When I get back, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Sure you're up for this?
Skitters are coming, whether we like it or not.
Hey, thanks, buddy.
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
You first.
Wow.
You sure know how to impress a girl.
What's next -- his and her grenade launchers?
Who knows?
I might do something crazy like open a door for you.
Hey, Ben!
Hey, wait up!
Hey, I know what happened with Dad was an accident, but the next time I give an order, I need to know you're gonna listen.
Whatever you say.
Hey.
Hold up.
Hey.
What's up, man?
I don't get you.
I mean, as much as he got into it with Weaver,
Dad always understood chain of command.
I'll follow your orders, but you're not Dad, okay?
Pretty sweet spot for wasting Skitters.
Put a shooter up on the roof with a Barrett.
Yeah, a .50-Cal will put a hole through anything.
Maybe get a cross fire going with that dry cleaner right there.
While you kids get that started, me and the brain trust, we'll get the cooties' attention.
We'll come back to the north side.
Get out of the truck!
Take cover!
Get out of the truck!
Do it now!
Get down!
Not the Harley!
Pope!
Stop!
Stop!
Come on, man.
Let it go, bro.
Let it go!
Come on!
What the hell went wrong?
Damned if I know.
Never even got off a shot.
They're onto us.
There's something else.
The way they kept laying fire into the truck after we bugged out -- it's like that was the target.
We know they can pick up heat.
Could be the engine is what got their attention.
First time they've targeted vehicles.
First time for everything.
With these beamers on constant patrol --
We're screwed and blued, and you can kiss this ambush plan goodbye.
If we can't run our trucks, we're not mobile.
The Skitters got to know we're close.
Won't be long before they catch our scent.
Captain, you wanted to see me?
Dai tells me that you're doing a fair job of taking over for Scott.
He did?
I can only hope he's right.
We think that the aliens have recalibrated their beamers to pick up the heat coming off our vehicles.
Probably using some infrared sensor.
As long as we stay put, engines off, they can't see us.
Only that's not an option.
Our patrols just saw three alien units all walking around out there, all within five miles.
It's only a matter of time before they nail us.
If we can't move our vehicles, we lose our mobility, and we lose most of our supplies.
We need to find a way to mask the heat coming off those engines long enough to put some distance between us and those patrols.
Well, how far?
At least 20 miles.
20 miles?
That would mean keeping the engines cooled out for at least an hour.
Okay.
All right. I'll try.
You don't get points for effort.
We don't find a way to move those vehicles, people are going to die.
No pressure.
I don't care what you wanted from us.
There must have been a way to get it peacefully.
You didn't even try to talk to us before the attack.
This was never a negotiation.
That's why we'll never stop fighting you.
We have no patience for empty bravado.
So those are our alternatives -- live as prisoners or die?
Why would you expect better from us than you do from yourselves?
Because I look around this ship, at the technology that brought you from another world, and I want to believe that only an advanced species could have achieved so much.
But I would be wrong.
You will lead your people to the neutral zone.
No.
Then the choice has been made.
I would be careful about drawing too many lessons from the past.
Why is that?
Because our history has yet to be written.
Tom Mason, 2nd Mass.
I didn't know they had anybody else.
Neither did I.
Bonnie Garcia, Vermont militia.
Bastards wanted me to lead them to my guys, talk them into buying this sanctuary bull.
That's why they took us -- to finish what they started.
This isn't right.
Oh, my God.
Everybody run!
Don't give it a target!
Run!
Find your stance.
Lean forward a bit.
Hey, Ben!
What's Matt doing with a gun?
Ben's teaching me how to shoot.
Figured it was time.
He needs to learn how to defend himself.
So you just gave him a rifle without asking me?
I might have to follow your orders on missions, but not here.
Hal, wait!
Go back to camp, Matt.
Go back to camp.
You know, maybe he's ready, maybe he's not, but we both know Dad didn't want that for him.
Three months ago.
How do you know what he'd say now?
I don't know what he'd say right now, and neither do you, okay?
So how about we wait and let Dad make that decision?
Only way we win this war is by killing every Skitter we see.
If Matt's old enough to load a gun, he's old enough to shoot it.
After what happened with Dad, you think you're the best one to be giving lessons?
I just don't want him to be taken away the way they took me.
Or your girlfriend, Karen.
I'm not the math geek you used to push around.
Deal with it.
It's like I don't even know him anymore.
Hal.
Michigan.
- Stop!
- Quit struggling!
Stop!
Get off of me!
I swear, if you don't let go of that bag,
I will shoot you!
Leave me alone!
It's all we have left!
Please!
I will shoot you!
No!
Do you understand?
!
Every store within 20 miles has been picked clean!
Please!
Please!
Run!
If I see you again, I'll use this!
My name's Tom.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just wanted to see your bike.
No!
It's mine!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop it!
I'm not letting you steal it!
Come on. Come on.
I'm sorry.
I should have asked.
Look, I know that you're scared.
But I'm not gonna hurt you.
If he comes back, we don't want to be here.
We had a few cans of soup.
That's all.
Go ahead!
Take it and leave me alone!
You hang on to it.
I'm on my way into Boston.
I left some people there -- friends and family.
They can help us.
Bike's yours, but I sure would love to borrow it.
You can come with me.
Boston?
That's hundreds of miles.
Oh, I know it.
I've been on foot for weeks already.
So...what do you say?
Just remember it's a loan.
And only as long as I say.
And only if we don't leave her like that.
Fair enough.
Captain.
I'll have the med bus packed and ready to go in a half-hour.
How's Tom?
I need to know what happened to him on that ship.
Ben and Lourdes are with him.
He's weak.
But if we have to move, I think it's all right.
Dr. Glass!
Do you know anything about scotch?
Some's good, some's better.
Why?
I found this... couple of stops back.
It's a Glenfiddich.
30 years old.
Someone has good tastes.
If we have to run, it's just dead weight.
Seemed like it'd be a shame to waste it.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Maybe it's a sign -- Tom coming back.
How do you mean?
I mean that if I hadn't let him get on that ship if he'd been here, he would have warned me that we were pushing our luck.
He would have warned me.
But he wasn't here.
Second-guessing doesn't change where we are.
I think you're wrong.
I remember something he told me once, about making the price of the occupation so high, the aliens have to leave.
That was the idea.
He would have said your strategy is risky but worth it.
And when he wakes up, he's gonna be proud we're still fighting.
Hell, he might even have a historical anecdote to put it all in perspective.
Captain.
What the hell is this?
Fiberglass.
It's light, it's an insulator, and these warehouses are full of it.
We wrap our engines with it, we'll get a good hour before it heats through.
I want people going through every house, every warehouse on the block.
We're moving out A.S.A.P.
Dr. Glass?
!
Anne?
!
Ben?
Anne!
It's my Dad.
Something's wrong.
Let's go.
We're close now.
We got to keep going.
I don't know what happened.
He just started bleeding again.
I must have missed a fragment.
He feels feverish, too.
We still have a few bottles of I.V. antibiotic.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Ben.
The school's only a few miles that way.
But they'd be long gone by now.
I've been seeing a lot of airships heading southwest to Connecticut.
Could be they went that way.
The woman we buried.
That was my mom.
I'm sorry.
You never told me why you helped me out with that guy.
That's what people are supposed to do.
Not anymore.
I don't believe that.
And I'd hope that someone would do the same for my kids.
We were going into the mountains, trying to find a place to hide.
I don't think that we can hide from them anymore.
My middle son, Ben -- you'd like him.
He's about your age.
He's dead.
No.
They're all dead.
That's what happens now.
The aliens find you, and they kill you.
Unless we kill them first.
Come on.
We got to keep going.
This engine-blanket thing better work, or we'll be wearing this truck for a hat.
That's another thing.
When the hell did I become a damn baggage handler?
I was gonna say it kind of suits you.
Yeah, well, I'll tell you, if I had any brains, I'd steal one of these rice rockets and kiss Weaver's glorious revolution goodbye.
Yeah, you try that, and your brains will be scattered across two states, Pope!
You really are a true believer, aren't you?
In killing Skitters, yeah.
Yeah, well, that's pretty, but, uh, you know, there's no law that says you got to do it with me.
My merry ex-band of outlaws wasted your buddy, and yet here you are, Tonto to my lone ranger.
Well, first, I think you got that "Lone Ranger" thing a bit backward.
And don't think that I forgot about Click... or when you patched me up after we went in on that alien structure.
I can't make sense of either.
We all make mistakes.
Captain!
Captain!
Hey, Cap!
Incoming!
Anthony, where's Cap?
Right there.
Captain, we got a Mech convoy about a mile away.
They're straight east.
They're coming this way.
We move that med bus now, Tom's not gonna make it.
Convoy goes!
Medical stays with Dr. Glass until she can stabilize Tom.
I need four volunteers to stay with the bus in case the Skitters show.
You know I'm in.
Sounds good.
Make that three.
Four.
Gather all the ammo you can carry.
Dai's got the map.
We wait for you 20 miles out.
Stay safe.
We're moving out, people!
Five minutes!
All right, guys, we got incoming.
Okay, we're gonna go dark.
There's something there.
I just can't get ahold of it.
All right, guys, we're gonna lay low and hope the Mechs pass us by.
Nobody shoot unless I give the order, okay?
Hey.
Okay?
Get down!
Not yet.
Lourdes, we have to hold him steady.
I think I've got it.
Not much to it.
It was enough.
We can close now.
I think they're gone.
Oh, God.
I think that was our lucky day, right?
Come on.
Let's go.
Hey, good job, man.
This is bad.
We need to keep riding.
It's close.
I don't want to be here anymore!
That's Mech fire.
That's a shotgun.
That means there's people.
You said when we started it was just a loan.
Got to see who's out there.
I'll come back when I know it's safe.
My mom wanted to show me the mountains.
I'm going there.
For her.
I hope you find your family.
Cease fire!
Save your ammo!
We got eight minutes, tops, before those beamers respond!
So let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Weaver?
Dad?
You're still here.
I never left, Tom.
You gave us quite a scare.
You feeling all right?
Better.
My boys?
They're fine.
I should have had faith... that you'd come back for them.
Not just for them.
Ben.
It's okay.
Dad, I, uh...
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know.
It was an accident.
Come here.
It doesn't matter.
All that matters now is that we're together.
Dad!
Oh.
Ben, don't --
Look at what the cat dragged in.
I missed you, old man.
I missed you, too.
I missed all of you.
Tom.
- How you feeling?
- Like it's good to be home.
Captain, we should talk.
Plenty of time for that.
You just get better first.
A lot of people will be glad to see you.
Welcome back, Tom.
Thanks, Dai.
Professor happen to mention how he, uh, busted out of Skitter Central?
He did not.
Man strolls onto an alien rocket, only to just come waltzing back three months later.
I don't know about you, Cap, but I'd be throwing a flag on that play.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
We're in the car, honey.
We're going to the hospital for tests.
We're in the hospital.
We're going to the doctor's office.
Can you tell me what this is called?
You use it to get food from inside.
Yes, but what's it called?
Is it a spatula?
No. Good.
Is it a can opener?
You're trying to make me look stupid.
You can go to hell!
Why don't you kill yourself?
Andres.
It's okay.
There she is.
Here I am.
Here. Come on.
You just need to answer a few more questions, then we're going home.
I'm sorry.
I have alzheimer's.
I know.
The mood swings come on quickly, but it's under control.
Don't worry.
He's actually perfect for the drug trial.
Thank God.
We can start as soon as next week.
FOREMAN: Early onset familial AIzheimer's.
Brazilian descent.
Blood chemistries showed high ammonia.
Vomiting stopped after the ER put him on antiemetics.
Any recent health issues?
Just a sore throat a few weeks ago.
How advanced is he?
Could be hyperalimentation.
Advanced enough, but no IV feedings.
The wife shut down her floral company to stay home and feed him every meal he's had in the last four years.
Do we owe this case to your guilt at having ignored your own forgetful mommy?
My guilt over my mom is why I put up with my dad.
You're taking this case because we're running a Phase Two trial on an alzheimer's drug.
You couldn't round up enough doddering, old guinea pigs, so you need us to fix this little piggy?
I'd like to sit in.
Especially since you're short a team member.
You mean Taub?
Got him in here.
He asked for personal days. His daughter's sick.
Isn't that the point of having a spare?
I denied his request.
After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.
Dr. Adams, taped under your chair is an index card.
Would you read it, please?
"Wednesday, 2:43 p.m.
"A black pawn will believe he's the black king
"and attempt to capture the white head of diagnostics."
It's 10:15 on Friday.
Damn it. (SIGHS) Look, the point is, I saw this coming.
Dr. Foreman and I did not always see eye to eye, but he never had the power to overrule me.
Now that he has the power, he won't be able to resist the temptation to use it.
With great power comes great micromanaging.
And great vests.
I know you're the better diagnostician.
I'm not gonna interfere. I'm only here to help.
Could be transient nitrogen load from a Gl bleed.
Not if the vomiting's persistent.
Which we won't know, because the ER put him on antiemetics.
Take him off.
Wait. He was puking his guts out. We'd risk aspiration.
I'm just disagreeing, not overruling.
So glad you're on board.
Take him off antiemetics. Do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds.
It could be a bladder infection.
We'll run a pregnancy test.
I'm not pregnant.
Any type of birth control can fail.
Not mine.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You said you were married?
Yeah. Happily.
It's okay.
Sex can wane in any marriage over time.
No, no. We've never had sex.
We kiss and cuddle, but neither one of us is interested in sex.
You're both celibate?
No, neither of us.
Celibacy is a choice.
This is our orientation.
We're asexual.
Not quite sure what box to check here.
CHASE: You're making a mistake.
If I had the power to veto him, given all the crap I've put up with over the years, I don't know if I could use it objectively.
I do. I can. I have.
It might be easier if you'd stay out of the room.
I thought it'd be different.
I'm supposed to talk to his PO about getting his ankle monitor off early.
You're saying he should defer to you?
I'm just saying what he's doing doesn't seem rational, which makes me think it's rational in a way I'm not privy to.
He always has a plan.
And he's always self-destructive.
He may just be shooting himself in the ankle.
I know it feels strange.
Dr. Chase is just looking in your throat.
We're in the hospital. You're fine.
That's a pretty nice trophy there, Andres.
NATALIE: He coached youth soccer.
Took a team that was zero-and-six all the way to the state finals at Long Branch.
Hey, thanks for doing this in here.
Switching rooms can be very disorienting.
You take very good care of him.
I love him.
Sickness and health, right?
Upper esophagus is clear, moving on to the GE junction.
Hey.
I'm sorry, family members only during procedures.
I'll wait outside.
Oh, no, please, it's okay.
Joseph helps me with my husband sometimes.
He's a good friend.
Which means not family.
Wait, we're gonna be here a while.
Why don't you show Joseph where the visitor's lounge is?
What?
I'm surprised you didn't go into the diplomatic corps.
Oh, you think they're...
If they're having sex, it's probably with their genitals.
Mallory-Weiss tear.
Vomiting must have torn the lining.
You know that close to 1 % of the population identifies as asexual?
We really got to get you laid.
If I have to plow that furrow myself, so be it.
I've a patient who's asexual.
Is she a giant pool of algae?
It's a valid sexual orientation, according to this article, at least.
Yeah, I think I read that, too.
Is that Fugliness Weekly?
She's perfectly fine-looking.
Happily married for 10 years.
To a guy who loves penis enough for both of them.
He's asexual, too.
Ran a complete physical on her. Nothing wrong except a common bladder infection.
Hundred bucks says I can find a medical reason why she doesn't want to have sex.
You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my patient.
Fine, I won't go near her.
Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.
No contact whatsoever.
You talk to her, the bet is void.
No contact.
Plays to my strengths, anyway.
Right now's not a good time, House.
Not for the Dean of Medicine, but it's the perfect time if you're a member of my team.
Which one are you?
What did the endoscopy show?
No signs of ulcers or blockages.
But you found a tear just below the esophagus.
Explains the bleeding.
Doesn't explain why he vomited so hard he ripped his insides.
His liver enzymes are slightly elevated.
Gallstones could...
No complaints of pain.
Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL levels rise.
Are you calling his liver fat?
Start the patient on statins, do a biopsy to confirm.
And knock him out, I've heard he's a wiggler.
There's no need to put him under. We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound.
Just making an observation.
Well done.
And now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation.
Of course.
Wait.
And there it is.
You're trying to screw with my confidence.
Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.
You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from ever intervening, even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.
Like now.
This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the patient.
Do the ultrasound.
Ultrasound it is.
And the nurses love you.
You don't think I knew House was gonna tell you to ignore me and not do the ultrasound?
This is an ultrasound machine.
Which you're gonna use to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.
You've probably got a kit stashed here...
"Cuddy Dark will waste his afternoon chasing conspiracy theories."
You're letting him get inside your head. He can do a lot of damage in there.
Dr. Chase, he started vomiting again.
This is why we stopped the antiemetics. We needed to see if it was still a symptom.
Here. You want this?
Get your hands off me.
You're taking my head!
It's okay, Andres.
You're in the hospital.
(GLASS SHATTERING) 10 milligrams of diazepam.
Already on it.
NATALIE: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Blood in his urine.
JESSICA: We resumed the antiemetics and increased his sedation.
He really went after her.
Maybe he found out about her "good friend."
It was just paranoid rage. Typical of Alzheimer's.
We don't even know if they were sleeping together.
A few hours ago, you were sure.
And that's significant why?
Sorry, only the bleeding's medically relevant.
No, I wasn't being rhetorical.
If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove?
You're pro infidelity?
She's not married.
If marriage is feeding and cleaning someone and limiting conversation to repeating a few simple commands, then I was married to my pet rat.
And a lot of people owe me wedding gifts.
And we're walking, we're walking.
I don't care how sick your spouse gets, you don't jump ship.
Alzheimer's is different. She can't share her problems with him, or plan for the future. The man she married no longer exists.
Yes, he does. He's in there.
This is why you get married.
Said the divorced woman to the divorced man.
I didn't jump ship.
My husband sank it when he cheated on me.
Commitment's not conditional.
She is there for him in the only way that matters now.
She gave up her life to take care of him.
Proves she's an idiot.
If she had any sense, she'd have stuck him in a facility and jumped on that strange...
We were just looking for you.
I was right about the antiemetics.
If we kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.
Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan to shake your confidence.
Let's see if this helps.
If you're speaking as a team member, then I'd say you're a moron.
'Cause taking him off the antiemetics gave us crucial diagnostic information.
If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine, then I'd say you're a moron.
'Cause your micromanaging kept us from doing a biopsy.
And if we had, the patient would've been anesthetized hours ago thus unable to go all Chris Brown on her ass.
Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.
Dr. Park, would you please reach under that chair?
"The patient will punch his wife."
You clearly wrote that after the fact.
Dr. Adams, would you please reach into my pants?
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz will accuse me
"of writing about the punch after the fact."
And look, there's a photograph of me holding a newspaper dated last Tuesday.
How could I have gotten my hands on that?
You done?
Rhabdomyolysis fits the vomiting, pigmenturia and renal failure.
No muscle symptoms and urine had no myoglobin.
TTP fits, though.
Start him on plasmapheresis.
Unless...
Unless I need to say, "Mother, may I?"
And "mother's" an abbreviation.
CHASE: Fresh plasma will replace the damaged red blood cells that are clogging his kidneys.
That sounds hopeful.
How's that feeling?
I've never been hit in the eye before. (LAUGHS)
I feel kind of badass.
I think maybe you should go.
Look, I'm fine, okay?
I'll see you tomorrow?
We're not having an affair.
It's none of my business.
I mean, not really.
'Cause nothing's happened, but we've talked about it a lot and...
It's just really hard doing this by myself.
When's the last time you had a full night's sleep?
I don't know.
Three years?
You're not gonna get any rest here.
People who are sick are not the only ones who need to be taken care of.
CHI: Why doesn't Chase have to be here?
You think he knows anything about women who don't want to have sex?
Hormone levels are normal.
This woman seems perfectly healthy.
What does it matter if she says she's asexual?
It's the fundamental drive of our species.
Sex is healthy.
Orgasms oxygenate the brain, lighting up over 30 different areas and making us forget how boring Susie Cooper is.
That last one may not be universal.
How about damage to her spinal cord, blocking the signals from her genitals?
Sex drive is in the brain.
I suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by childhood abuse.
She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last 10 years.
It's not the same. Sex releases oxytocin, it's the neurochemical basis for bonding.
And that's why men always marry their right hands.
It's different for girls.
No, it's not.
I've tapped over 30 guys and never wanted to see most of them again.
I lived next to a Jewish frat.
We are veering wildly off track.
Please continue.
This woman's life is probably better off without sex.
Eliminates most of her insecurities, she's immune to most advertising, and can have honest relationships with men.
(LAUGHS) Not a lot of them.
We've run every test and ruled out all the options.
You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.
Lots of people don't have sex.
The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead or lying.
So maybe she's lying.
You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?
For 10 years?
Sticking around the whole time?
It doesn't make sense.
What does...
Thirty?
Everybody lies.
Higher or lower?
Followed your advice and took the night off.
It seems to have done you some good.
Where's my husband?
He's not in the hospital.
So he just walked out?
All of the shift nurses had their hands full with a double code.
HOUSE: Perfectly reasonable explanation.
Same thing happened to me. Couldn't find my keys for days.
The police have been notified, I have staff searching.
You told me it was okay to leave.
I'm sorry.
He has alzheimer's!
It's freezing outside! And he's sick!
I mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?
The plasmapheresis hasn't had time to work, but TTP is our most likely...
Okay, I have to go look for him.
Hey. Don't be an ass.
Can't you see she's upset?
No, she's guilty.
Instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.
Yeah, he already said I was an ass.
Personally, I applaud your decision to step down off your cross and get on with your life, but your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.
We need you to sit, focus, and answer our questions.
So it's 6:00 a.m., patient wakes up, and the first thing he sees...
In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's patients regress to old routines.
HOUSE: So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?
Nothing. Be at home.
What about a year ago, five years, or 10?
I don't know.
He trained for a marathon once.
Soccer practice.
We took a cooking class.
The soccer trophy you were telling me about, it's gone.
Where was practice?
It was close to here, on Chesterfield.
Okay, he comes, he thinks he's waiting for practice.
He'd want to get out of the wind, but somewhere he could see the kids arrive.
There.
Over here!
On three.
One, two, three.
Nothing.
Not dead till he's warm and dead.
Get him to the ICU.
Start him on extracorporeal circulation.
That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.
We can deal with his metabolism crashing. We can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.
Either way, if we don't get his temperature above 95, it's not gonna matter.
Multiple warm lavage is safer.
Do what House says.
NATALIE: He has no heartbeat, he's not breathing.
How can he not be dead?
Body slows down when it cools, but it doesn't fully stop.
We're warming his blood outside of his body and then putting it back.
It'll raise his temperature enough that his heart should naturally start.
Then we can shock it back into rhythm.
And if it doesn't start?
Then there's nothing we can do.
You think it's possible he knew what he was doing?
Like some part of him gets what he's putting his wife through, so he tried to...
Kill himself?
It's what I'd do if I were him.
At least I wish I would.
I meant run away.
You think you should kill yourself if you become a burden to the people who love you?
If you really loved them back, then yes.
That's really dark.
It's not naive.
I just believe people are capable of more than you do, apparently.
We've got brain activity.
Temp's at 93.
His heart should start soon.
My dad left me alone to care for my alcoholic mom and raise my baby sister.
I was just a teenager.
I spent half of my time changing diapers and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.
But it must have been important that you stayed for both of them.
Mom died after a few years.
It was ugly and painful, and she went with me hating her.
My sister ended up drinking half of her life away and hating me because I couldn't help.
After Mom, I had nothing left.
So do I wish Mom had used a gun instead of a bottle?
I didn't know.
That's why I told you.
Ventricular fibrillation.
Give him 300 milligrams amiodarone.
Be careful.
Once we establish rhythm, any accidental movement could crash him back into V-fib.
Clear.
We still have a long way to go.
Cold can be protective to the brain, but there is a possibility of damage.
We also need to confirm and treat whatever's making him sick.
I just gotta do a standard battery of tests.
Blood, urine, EEG.
Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?
Excuse me, I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.
I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the patient.
Exactly. You never said anything about the patient's husband.
The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.
I admit I was stuck until I realized that the medical issue was not hers, but his.
She's lying to compensate.
It's a tale as old as time.
Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy.
Boy says, "I'm asexual."
Girls says, "Yeah, me, too."
Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a patient into being tested is completely unethical.
Come on.
Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?
You love all that caring crap.
You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart. You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.
I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.
Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.
How do you know she's happy?
Did she tell you?
No, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.
All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt people's claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.
You tell me which one's worse.
He just opened his eyes a little while ago.
His heartbeat's doing well and his body temperature stabilized.
There he is.
Is that Portuguese?
Honey, I don't understand.
What's he saying? (SIGHS)
I don't know.
I tried to learn when we got married, but I just... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
His body temperature is rising.
It's above normal.
Wait, I thought you said it was stable.
Why is it still rising?
I don't know.
Vomiting, liver, kidneys and now fever.
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr. Foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job.
But when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard...
Get to the point.
The word "fever." Could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.
He couldn't have caught a virus while he was outside, fever came on too fast.
The hypothermia could have caused cell necrosis.
TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out.
Fever's a little high, but it still fits.
We should continue plasmapheresis.
We're missing symptoms.
We should add language loss and aggression.
Should we also add forgetfulness?
He's got AIzheimer's.
We've just been assuming.
Because the patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.
He's never hit her before or lost all his English.
We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.
"Have to? " Do I need to pull out another card?
Disseminated viral infection.. with encephalitis.
Patient complained of a sore throat a few weeks ago.
Start him on interferon.
CHASE: Encephalitis makes his brain swell, which causes symptoms that are hard to distinguish from his Alzheimer's.
With the interferon, his English should come back and the aggression should subside.
But you're not sure?
Unfortunately, no.
And you're not sure if he has brain damage from being frozen?
So best-case scenario, I just had a glimpse into his future?
I can't take care of him anymore. JESSICA:
Chances are his mental state will improve.
You could get more time with him.
We married six months after I met him.
A year after that, he started forgetting things.
I've known my husband longer with his AIzheimer's than without.
I've watched more of him disappear than I ever got to know.
I just can't do this anymore.
You lose.
Blood work shows high levels of prolactin.
Add that to some peripheral red-green confusion, puts my money, excuse me, your money, soon to be my money, on a tumor near his pituitary.
Probably started growing in his early teens.
Lowering his libido and causing erectile dysfunction.
A year on dopamine agonists and he'll be a sex-crazed creep just like the rest of us. Completely fascinated by Susie Cooper.
I would prefer to be paid in a single $100 bill.
Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.
Hooray for us.
We disproved his asexuality.
We also probably ruined his life.
He'll thank us.
Then he'll doze off. And then, in a couple of hours, he'll thank us again.
It could destroy his identity.
It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.
So don't tell him.
Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?
He'll notice it eventually when it starts leaking out his ears.
It's a slow-growing tumor.
He'll probably die of boredom long before that.
You always do this.
You meddle and force me into impossible situations.
You knew the second you told me about this case that I'd get involved.
You wanted me to meddle.
'Cause no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance, you didn't buy it either.
Where's that petition House's PO sent over about him getting his ankle monitor off?
On your desk.
You played me.
This whole thing was about your ankle monitor.
You weren't trying to undermine my confidence, you were trying to inflate it.
You manufactured conflict with me so, eventually, you could let me win.
You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it, because then, with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor.
You're right.
Take off my monitor.
See, the beauty of the plan is if it works, then you think you can control me.
If it fails, then you will actually have proven that you can control me.
It's pretty genius.
These are your training wheels.
If you think you're up to this job, it's time to lose them.
Second half of my plan might need work.
V-fib.
Two rounds at 360 without establishing a rhythm.
Wait!
Clear.
He's back.
I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crapload of time and man power just to let this guy watch his mind shrivel and keep his wife miserable.
Heart attack while he was on interferon rules out encephalitis, but I still think I'm right about the neuro symptoms.
It's probably aseptic meningitis.
We would have seen meningeal signs.
Given his abnormal mental status, not necessarily.
Would you please reach under your chair?
It's just wet gum under here.
Where's the card?
What card?
I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.
Toxins.
If this guy went on a walkabout, chances are he's done it before.
Wife keeps the doors in the house locked.
There's plenty of nasty stuff to get into during the middle of the night.
We asked about toxins on the history. The wife said she was sure to clear the house for her husband's safety.
And I'm sure she succeeded. She's a PhD in toxicology, right?
She's an ex-florist.
Search the home for toxic plants, methyl bromide, any medications.
You're not infallible. You were wrong about encephalitis.
Just before you were.
Run CSF tests, find out what's causing the meningitis.
You said you weren't gonna overrule me, diagnostically.
And you said I wouldn't be able to help it.
Apparently, you were right about that one.
Fine.
I'll look for toxins myself.
You can't go to their house without Foreman's permission.
Don't need it, I'm gonna talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs.
HOUSE: What about gifts from South America?
Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?
I don't think so... No.
I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your house.
Toxins are the most...
Wait. You understand him?
What's he saying?
He's repeating "blue shack."
You know what that is?
Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?
It's where we had our first date.
Do you have a cleaning lady who might bring her own supplies?
What's he saying?
If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care, and neither should you.
Please.
This might be the last time I ever know what he's thinking.
(TRANSLATING) "When I saw her waiting... "Waiting for me at the table...
"The way her eyes looked when she smiled...
"I felt like crying.
"I knew she was the woman I wanted to marry.
"And every time I see her, I say...
"There she is." "There she is."
He's still in there.
What did he say?
He asked who you were.
Don't get your hopes up.
Have your boyfriend get me those samples.
How did you even know to look for a tumor?
Dr. House noticed hormone levels in your blood and consulted with me as an oncologist...
Who cares how they found it.. okay? They found it.
Are there any side effects to the treatment?
Some nausea, dizziness, and as the tumor shrinks, there will be behavioral changes.
Like what?
Well... The tumor interferes with certain natural systems.
It lowers libido and causes erectile dysfunction.
You mean the treatment will make me want to have sex?
What if I don't want the treatment? I would strongly advise...
Look, you have a brain tumor, okay?
You have to have the treatment.
Okay, look, I know who I am, okay?
And I'm not one of them.
Hey, look, we'll adjust.
Okay?
We can go through this together.
You mean have sex?
I can't make you do that.
Maybe it won't be so bad.
It'll be terrible.
It's actually pretty fun.
From what I remember.
But you said that...
I know.
I know.
I wanted to spend my life with you and I knew that meant making certain sacrifices.
But a girl has needs.
You dropped in the U.S. News rankings.
With respect, Mr. Laffont, that's only because we temporarily shut down our diagnostics department.
It's up and running again.
I'm actually concerned it might be because of the change in management.
If you want my money, I'll need to see a five year plan.
Am I boring you?
No, I just, those flowers are from last week.
Excuse me?
Sorry, I have to go.
It's Reye's Syndrome.
Patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.
Reye's in adults is a reach.
Not if he took aspirin.
Aspirin in adults is a reach.
Especially in a house with locked medicine cabinets.
It wasn't in the medicine cabinet.
The wife used to run a floral company, still does a few orders from home.
She uses crushed aspirin in the water to make the flowers last longer.
So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat...
You can stop me whenever you like.
Have Chase start him on steroids.
I already did.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I wanted you to hear it from me.
There she is.
Here I am.
Your eye.
What happened?
It's nothing I can't handle.
MRI confirmed macroprolactinoma.
He's doing the treatment.
And the wife?
Come on.
We saved a man's life, course-corrected two people's wildly screwed up worldviews.
Not bad for a day's work.
I think they were happy, even if it was based on lies.
Most happiness is.
Better to have shtupped and lost than never to have shtupped at all.
We can't smoke in here.
We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet, and yet it happens.
It's an imperfect world.
Well?
Disgustingly satisfying.
He said it was okay.
Is one of you Dr. House?
You've seen Spartacus, right?
I got an order here to deactivate and remove his ankle monitor.
(OVER PHONE) Robbie?
Hey, sis.
It's been years.
I know.
I thought of you on Mom's birthday.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Fine. I just wanted to see how you were.
I'm fine.
Bikes go faster without training wheels.
Now get out, I have work to do.
Uncle Lou!
There's my man.
Shawn, I got a new one for you.
What do polar bears get from sitting on the ice too long?
Polaroids.
Lou, I don't know what that means, but I know it's funny.
What's goin' on, dad?
Huh?
Oh, uh, nothin'.
Just work stuff.
Can you tell me about it?
Well, maybe when you're a little older.
Come on.
I'm old enough to drive.
I think I can handle hearing about one of your cases.
Shawn, you're not gonna be able to drive for three years.
Really?
Then how will Gus and I get to Vegas this weekend?
Come on, Henry.
He can handle it.
Fine, but I'm calling you when he can't sleep tonight.
We're looking for a missing girl.
What's her name?
Veronica Towne.
Where was she last seen?
This bar where she waitresses called the blue derby.
What was she wearing?
Why's that matter?
A red dress.
And a gold necklace with her initials on it.
Thanks, Lou.
So do you think she was murdered?
Startin' to look that way.
Uh, who do you think did it?
Guy by the name of Jordan beaumont, her boss at the blue derby.
But we can't prove it until we find the place where he stashed the body.
Or places.
Gotcha.
You're not gonna be able to sleep tonight, are ya?
Not a wink.
Thanks, Lou.
So it's been a while since you've given me an update on you and Jules.
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
We're doin' great.
And can I tell you why?
Why?
We're done stressing about when we're moving in together, getting married.
We both know that's not happening until way down the line.
I hear that.
After retirement and menopause.
Now, we can just relax and enjoy each other.
Oh!
And we found this amazing book called the ***
What?
Illustrations are illuminating.
There's one called "congress of the rhino."
Shawn!
I have never been so happy to see a dead person in my life.
Jules!
What do we got?
Unidentified male found dead.
Gunshot wound to the face.
- Ouch.
- Who's the big, scary guy?
Carlton Lassiter.
You should know that by now.
He's the foreman on the construction site.
He's the one who found the body.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Montero, your story, much like your lunchbox... smells a little fishy.
I mean, you're diggin' over here.
You find the body way over there.
How did that happen?
I had to take a leak.
So after you found the body, then what'd you do?
I really had to take a leak.
We're gonna need to interview the rest of your crew.
Stop!
Stop!
What are you doing?
I'm sensing there's something in there.
Well, what is it, Shawn?
What the hell?
What was she wearing?
A red dress.
And a gold necklace with her initials on it.
I'm so not sleeping tonight.

Chief vick, is there any truth to the rumors that one of the bodies found yesterday belongs to Veronica Towne?
I have no comment on that at this time.
Has anyone in her family been contacted?
I will pass along all info as it becomes available.
Thank you.
When can we expect a statement, chief vick?
Chief vick!
Don't have an I.D. On this fella yet, but I believe his time of death was approximately 6:00 P.M.
On the day in question.
Now, as for this one,
Shawn's hunch about it being Veronica Towne was spot on.
Yeah, she was quite a looker.
Still is.
Anyway, all the records match.
Her shoes and dress, however?
Not so much.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I can be a real bitch sometimes.
How did she die?
Well, my first guess was smallpox, but it turns out she had none of the symptoms.
Plus, smallpox apparently was eradicated about 40 years ago.
Who knew?
Not me.
Not me.
But, based on the fracture to her neck, I'm going to say she was strangled to death.
Jordan beaumont did this.
Who's Jordan beaumont?
Her boss.
The bar she worked at, the blue derby.
That's right, Shawn.
He was also her boyfriend and a real S.O.B.
He was seen pushing her around in a parking lot a couple of hours before she vanished.
How do you know so much about this case?
Because I was the lead detective, along with my partner at the time, Lou gamble.
May he rest in peace.
Sweet old Uncle Lou had a thousand jokes about hemorrhoids.
They were all hilarious.
Jordan was our lead suspect the entire time.
So why couldn't you get him?
Never got enough evidence.
So why couldn't you get him?
Beaumont, why do I know that name?
'Cause his father Ellis is one of the most successful and powerful businessmen in all of Santa Barbara.
You mean hewas.
We just got an I.D. On this body.
So now I've got two bodies:
The girl who's been missing for 20 years and the father of the man long suspected of killing her.
Do you have any other bombshells for me?
Did you see the finale ofthe bachelorette?
- Yes.
- Then no, I do not.
Our theory is that Jordan beaumont killed Veronica Towne 20 years ago and recently offed his father.
Dumped his body in the same spot.
Why would Jordan bury one body and not the other?
Maybe it was some weird admission of guilt.
Ah.
Kinda like Gus admitting that he likes cat food.
I said I like how it looks in commercials.
There's a difference.
No, there is not a difference.
I want Jordan tracked down and questioned immediately.
Shawn and Gus, you're on this as well.
Karen.
What should I do?
I'd like you to serve in your usual role.
You know, crosswords, air-bombing the men's room.
I think I should also work the case.
As what?
A detective?
Nobody knows it better than I do.
You could reinstate me.
This one time.
Come on, Henry.
All due respect, you can't just hop back in the game after all these years.
There's been a lot of changes on the job.
Lassie's right.
For example, the bicycle?
It's no longer just one giant wheel with a tiny one in back.
And now, my people can vote.
Kare I promise you I can handle this thing.
Plus, I owe it to Lou gamble to solve this case.
Come on.
Let me finish what I started.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Okay, chief, I don't think you're thinking this all the way through.
I'm going to Jordan's house.
I think he still lives at his parents' estate.
You two should go to the club he owns on 26th street.
Wha?
Okay, so do we go with your dad or with Lassie?
Worst.
Options.
Ever.
Will you relax?
You act like this is the first time you've ever worked with your dad.
How 'bout you relax, huh?
How 'bout that?
I am relaxed.
It's usually from a distance, man.
I'm having flashbacks to the time he chaperoned our eighth-grade field trip.
Ooh, I remember that.
He kept undoing his pants to tuck in his shirt.
It was horrifying.
Now, he's 20 years weirder and, this time, he's carrying a gun.
Detective Spencer.
Been a while.
So where's Lou?
He died of a heart attack four years ago.
Shocking. He took such good care of himself.
Hey.
Hey.
Easy.
Easy, Sipowicz.
Gentlemen, the timing of your visit is not ideal.
As you may know, my client's father has just passed away and he has arrangements to make.
Like what?
Like, uh, renovating the giant house he just inherited?
What's your point?
What do you think it is?
Look, you clearly think that I killed my father.
Oh, yeah?
Actually, I forgot what my point was, but what you just said makes a lot of sense.
Excuse me, who are you?
Shawn Spencer.
That is my partner, Sh'dynasty.
It is spelled s-h...
comma to the top... dynasty.
Comma to the top?
That's God's comma.
And I am a badass psychic detective,
Jack Fon Swoo.
He's also my son.
Dad.
You took the teeth right out of my "badass" comment.
I'd be very careful how you tread here, gentlemen.
We will not stand for further libelous accusations like the ones related to Veronica Towne.
Oh, you mean the woman we found dead 30 yards from his father?
Yeah.
That's right.
You got anything to say about that, smartass?
Small world?
For the record,
I was at my girlfriend thea's all last night.
Oh, that's nice.
That's sweet.
Do you have an address for this thea?
Gentlemen, my client is under no obligation to answer any questions from you.
Now, I'll have to ask that you leave.
Immediately.
Take it easy, Kat Von D.
Know this, Jordan.
I'm on to you.
Like fat... On a fat person.
Please.
You're not gonna find anything on me, Shawn.
What makes you so sure?
Because the apple does not fall far from the tree.
Gentlemen.
Man.
I want to punch that smarmy bastard, and then laugh in his handsome, ethnically-neutral face.
No one wants to nail this guy's ass more than I do.
Sorry. I'm a little rusty on my cop talk.
What are we doin' here anyway, Shawn?
Lookin' for room 207.
It was the number on his valet ticket dated Saturday night.
You see?
He wasn't at his girlfriend thea's.
Unless, of course, thea lives here.
May I help you?
Thea summers, we need to ask you a few questions about Jordan beaumont.
Fun. I love boy talk.
Jordan definitely has a type.
Oh, yes, he does.
Feel free to help yourself to the minibar.
I have been waiting my entire life to hear those exact words.
Ooh!
I'm so glad I quit that stupid cleanse today.
So, thea, you've been here a while.
About three weeks.
Nice place.
I guess, if you like green.
Dude!
Have some respect for yourself.
Suck it, Shawn.
So I guess dating Jordan has its perks, huh?
I'd say we're more "seeing each other."
I save the "D" word for guys I'm sleeping with.
Really?
No whoopie?
No hanky-pank in the nighty-night?
No dark dancing?
So what does a guy get for putting you up in a place like this?
A step closer to sleeping with me.
Dad!
What are you doing?
Just gotta quickly tuck in my shirt.
That is easily accomplished without unbuttoning your pants.
This is my field trip all over again.
Do you mind if I step outside for a cigarette?
Course not.
Go ahead. Just...
I can tell you're not a fan of working with your father.
How did you know he... you have the same eyes.
Don't worry.
I'm no stranger to daddy issues.
That photo in your bag suggests otherwise.
It was a happier time.
Have you always been such a snoop?
Oh, yeah.
Hence, my nickname in high school.
Snoopy?
Hammer time.
Where'd you live before the beaumont?
Michigan.
Moved to Santa Barbara three weeks ago to get away from the cold.
I planned on staying the night, but then I met Jordan and he started comping me.
When's the last time you saw him?
Last night.
We stayed in and watched summer school.
Pretty lame, right?
Yeah, if you hate cinematic perfection.
Ski school was on before that.
Did you guys watch ski school?
No.
Jordan arrived just as summer school was starting.
Hello, everyone.
Great to be back.
Enjoy your stay.
Chief, I would very much like to elbow him in the sternum.
Please do.
- Estimated time of death for Ellis beaumont is 6:00 P.M.
Jordan arrived at the hotel just as summer school was starting, at 9:00, which is true because I was watching too.
Nobody paints a scene like Dean Cameron.
He's "chainsaw," right?
That's right, chief.
So that leaves a three-hour gap in his alibi.
Well, it's thin, but it's enough to hold him for questioning.
What is up with Mr. Guster?
Sugar crash.
He just ate $600 worth of candy from the hotel minibar.
Shawn.
I've been lookin' all over for you, now listen.
We found another person's DNA on Veronica Towne.
We ran some tests.
We have a match.
- Great.
- Let me guess.
Jordan beaumont.
No.
The name that came up was...
Lou gamble.
What?
Let me see that.
Uncle Lou?
- There's no way that Lou gamble had anything to do with Veronica Towne's death.
Then what was S DNA doin' all over her body?
I don't know.
Maybe it was a mix-up in the lab, somebody tried to set him up, it doesn't matter.
Lou was a great cop, and he was as decent a guy as you'll find.
He certainly didn't seem like the murdering type.
Then again, neither did Matthew McConaughey's character in the Lincoln lawyer.
Ryan Phillippe was the murderer in that movie.
Really?
I never saw it.
Henry Spencer!
I don't believe it.
Aw, it's great to see ya, bea.
Hey, you remember my son, Shawn, don't ya?
Of course.
Hi, bea.
Last time I saw you, you were practically in tears because your dad wouldn't buy you an ice cream.
When was that, Henry?
Six years ago.
These were the best years of Lou's life.
Working with you, Jack, and Jerry.
Yeah.
Well, we were quite a team.
You know, back in those days, honor and respect for the badge meant something.
Worst boy band ever.
Do you all still keep in touch?
Occasionally.
Jack still lives in town.
Jerry has a place north.
I'm the only one who hasn't retired.
He means physically.
Mentally, it's naptime, bea.
'Scuse me, do you mind if I have some of this candy?
- Of course, dear.
- Thank you.
You have a problem, Candyman.
I make the world taste good.
Bea, back in '91, do you remember hearing
Jack talk about a case involving the name Veronica Towne?
No.
He rarely talked to me about any of his cases.
Do you remember anything strange about his behavior at the time?
Please, this is important.
Well, let's see.
'91.
Well, there were the calls.
What calls?
I'll be right back.
Are you kidding me?
You just crashed at the police station.
Playas don't crash, Shawn.
They rest their eyes, and then they refuel.
Burton!
For about a week, I would get these calls when I was alone from a man with a deep, raspy voice, and he'd say things like,
"how's your day going, bea?" Then hang up.
