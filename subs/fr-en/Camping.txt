-Beuts, darlings...
- Honey!
Did you close the fish?
- Your fish are closed!
Come on, come on!
- The beard!
- Left light:
It flashes, it doesn't flash.
It flashes, it doesn't flash.
On the right: it flashes.
It's not flashing.
There you go.
Now the ball!
Mrs. Ballot, think about what we just said.
After the holidays, I attack the works.
- It's not painful?
- No pain.
- Goodbye.
- My tributes.
Your wife called, your daughter's waiting for you.
- I know, Laurence.
Have a nice holiday.
- And Mrs. de Brantes is here.
Doctor!
I have a real problem with the volume of my chest.
- What's wrong with that chest?
Heavy, shut up.
Harmonious.
I wouldn't go beyond that.
- A little more!
-A hunchman, you take his arms and legs off: it's a madeleine.
Have a nice holiday.
- Well?
- I've been waiting for you.
- It's okay, honey.
Excuse me.
To give his daughter a vacation, you need the means.
And my job...
- It's convincing and it takes time.
What's this car?
James Bond's car.
There was an auction in London.
I cracked.
Not bad, huh?
- How do you drive?
- Like Bond.
James Bond.
- 10:00 a.m. Tolls.
No miracle, like every year.
- When do we get here?
- We had to leave earlier.
And I have the delicacy not to say because of who.
It's the red weekend, Gatineau.
- FM highway, hello.
On the roads, it's the red weekend.
-Hi, Jacky.
Hey, Laurette.
-Hi!
9.17 a.m.:
Better than last year.
And again, we got the trucks at the entrance to Angoulême.
Hey, everybody!
-Hi!
- Grandma Bigoudis!
-Jacky's coming: the holidays begin!
-9:17!
And again, we got the trucks in Angoulême.
-Hi, Jacky!
- Hello, everybody!
Are you all right, love?
-Hi, Jacky.
- You've gained weight!
Watch this.
Hello, miss!
You're the news I got on the phone?
- Mr. Pic?
Well, what's left of it after 9:17 a.m.
- Mr. Pic, we had a little problem.
- What?
We've set up a computer system: Logicamp.
It's a very good software.
But the computer changed your location.
-How?
I'm not on the 17th?
- No.
You're at 18.
Very nice location.
I don't care about your Logicamp.
I'm on the 17th, not the 18th!
- I'm sorry.
On the 17th, they're Dutch, the Van Den Roys.
- Dutch?
Is Mrs. Chatel here?
- She'll be here tonight.
- Listen, miss.
For 30 years..
..I make 697 km every August for location 17.
On location 17, there is my tree on which my wife and I put our initials.. ..in a heart engraved with the opinel..
Computer science can't hurt a certain logic!
- I understand, but there's nothing we can do.
- All right.
Then you'll have to explain to the whole campsite why the Pics won't spend their holiday at the Blue Flots.
-Jacky?
- Pack up your flip-flops, Mom.
We're going home, the holidays are over.
Okay.
I'm waiting for Mother Chatel.
But I'm not putting on the awning.
Because for me, tomorrow, we're across the street!
- What do you want me to say?
- Be careful, Germans!
- They're Dutch, Jacky.
- It's the same.
If the situation doesn't get out of hand tonight, in nine hours, we're in Melun!
Logicamp or not!
-Hi, Jacky!
Aren't you on the 17th?
- A computer problem!
It's not a campsite anymore, it's Kennedy Airport!
- Kids, stay here for now.
Oh, my Jacky, what a history room!
It's the first one.
A cup of tea?
- I'm in control of consumption.
Last year we drank 30 bottles.
25 per cent of the vacation budget.
Then it's okay!
When they invent the Ricard diesel, we'll save money.
One word, one gesture and Jacky does the rest.
-Oh!
Hello!
-Jacky, don't look at him like that.
You're hurting yourself.
-Then people drink.
- That's 37!
Jacky's here!
- Did you come back?
- This is Christy.
I want you to meet my friends.
The hard core of Blue Flots:
The 17 Jacky gang.
-Laurette, his wife.
In Melun, it's two.
-Sophie Gatineau.
Loire-Atlantique is four.
Paulo, her husband.
- The 37th, a coiffette?
-Stop it!
We know each other.
- Two years is nothing.
Paulo, how long did I call you on 44?
- Oh, there, at least ten pegs!
Come on, let's go!
- Pastis in blue weather... (all chorus)
- Cheers!
- Well?
Aren't we waiting for Patrick?
It's been hard.
My dismissal, withdrawal of permits, add to that a tough herpes.
Good thing Sylvie was here.
- She's not here?
- She's with the girl at Grandma's.
- It's not in September?
- It's August!
- Why are you getting mad?
-Stop it!
It's the holidays!
Christy, what are you doing?
- I'm doing a little modeling on Tour.
Shows lingerie, cabin model...
- She's very much in demand.
But his real talent is...
Well, say it!
- It's the song.
I'm singing a little.
- She sings very well.
In September, I'm launching it.
Three night clubs are interested.
And maybe a single at the end of the year.
Did you see how beautiful it is?
- You're reading?
-Sylvie wants me to evolve a little.
This summer, I decided to move on.
-A course?
- Yes.
The black dot, you know what it is?
- No.
- It's the little finger of the Statue of Freedom.
- You do it every year.
Come on, get in the water!
- Pass it!
- I got it!
- Yeah!
-Shit!
You're a pain in the ass, Paulo!
You're playing like a blunder!
If we play like this against nudists, they're making us go crazy.
And I'm tired of getting beat up by guys with the quinquequette in the air!
-Excuse me, Patrick.
I'm not there.
-Break!
Five minutes!
It's not the Paulo I know.
What's the matter?
Not bad, both.
It's heavy.
All right.
Drop it!
- I cheated on Sophie.
On New Year's Eve, at friends' houses.
Sophie was sick.
I was alone.
And at 3:00 in the morning, I jumped the boyfriend's sister-in-law.
- You didn't tell him?
- No, but Sophie, it's a radar on the legs.
I'm gonna throw the piece away.
- No!
Don't ever confess!
Never, do you love her?
- Yes, but I can't touch her anymore.
It flashes everywhere:
"I'm an asshole!"
I'm afraid to scream "Bunny" when I come.
- "Bunny"?
- That's his little name.
Look, Paulo, you cheated on your wife, she doesn't know it and you're sorry.
So you're a good guy, Paulo!
It's all right!
We're back, guys!
8-6!
Are you yelling when you're playing?
- How are you?
- We're fine.
Except we haven't had sex in six months.
That's what holidays are for!
How long have you been married?
- Let's celebrate the 16th.
But he's nice.
He offered me flowers, he took me to Sardou.
He's a perfect husband, but he doesn't touch me.
- He has a mistress.
- No, I don't.
Paulo, he's a husband.
If I took a lover, I wouldn't take Paulo.
- I could.
-Finally, you know me.
It's gonna have to move and fast!
- Did you see how pretty it is?
- Yes.
- Yes, very well.
-Ah!
Do you speak French?
That's good, 'cause I wanted to ask you...
There was a little problem.
Would you and I... we could... if you don't mind...
- My wife, Cornelia.
-Ah.
Hello, Mrs. Cornelia.
Jacky Pic.
- My wife loves this tree.
Very good shade for the little baby.
What did you want to ask me?
- I wanted to ask you...
Where exactly are you from in Holland?
- What's going on?
Sophie, protect your buttocks from the sun because it's gonna cost you a lot in Biafine!
- Always so funny!
- Yours, an Englishman!
- He's a Parisian.
- What's going on?
- No, we're waiting for sunset!
- Yes, we're out of order.
Excuse my father.
- Yes, it's Mr. Saint-Josse.
How's it going?
Tomorrow morning?
Are you kidding me?
I'm paying for troubleshooting.
It's not to hear me say there are Sundays.
The Mendez garage?
Where are we?
-Route of the beaches.
-Route of the beaches.
What city?
-Between Arcachon and the Moulleau.
-Between Arcachon and the Moulleau.
- But it's more Arcachon.
-Finally...
- Yes, it's more Arcachon.
- Closer to Arcachon.
-Site camping des Flots Bleus.
- We'll say camping des Flots Bleus.
- Where's the dead man's place on this car?
- I don't know if he's air-conditioned, but he looks stupid when we push him!
- Isn't that gas?
Because it happened to me.
- What's going on?
- It's broken.
We'll help him out tomorrow.
- It's Sunday.
He was going to Spain.
- What garage?
-Mend.
- That's good.
There's one in the Moulleau, too.
But Arcachon, it's closer.
- See?
- Don't worry.
You're with the family.
You're here at home.
Tranquil, peinard, at the campsite.
Apero?
- No, thank you, gentlemen, ladies.
- There are good hotels on Arcachon.
It's a little...
They're taking advantage of it.
It's a good war.
It's August.
You were going to Spain?
-Marbella.
- It's not the road.
- I took a walk through the Medoc for wine.
It wasn't mustard!
I say that because I live in Dijon.
Do you know him?
- By name.
- There you go!
In Dijon, nobody stops.
- Except to buy mustard.
- Very strong!
I'm Patrick.
Come on!
- Yes, Sarah.
The week of the 23rd, I'm at a convention in Miami.
I'll do it later.
You tell him.
Thank you, Sarah.
- Are you a surgeon?
- Yes, aesthetics.
- Still...
Wow, class...
- Hello, I'd like a double room.
- No, it's full.
Try Hotel Bellevue, but in August...
- Thank you.
He's a plastic surgeon.
Hello, Didier?
It's Patrick from the beach.
Yeah, blue swimsuit.
I need a double room for one night with breakfast.
Got it!
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you, Didier.
Great.
Chao.
It's full.
Come in.
Tent Marshal.
4 adults, 2 children.
Ventilation, waterproof seams, polyethylene floor mat.
And be careful...
The guest room with mosquito net door.
- It's a tent.
- Yeah.
A little more, though.
The pantry!
There's everything.
White wine mackerels, Catalan tuna, lentils, ravioli.
My wife's coming in a week.
So we had to refuel.
That's desserts.
Yum!
There's BN, there's four-quarters of Benco.
And you don't have to ask me.
No chichis between us.
You're here at home.
- The shower, the toilet?
- It's all in the bathroom.
See the reception?
Behind.
Next to the snack.
For water, avoid those on the right.
It's Turkish.
I'd rather warn.
Settle down.
- What a mess...
- I'm changing for Mrs. Chatel's pot.
It sets the tone for the holidays.
Are you coming?
- No, we're gonna get some rest.
Thank you so much for everything.
Are you sure?
- Dear campers, welcome to the Blue Flots.
It's nice to meet you.
We're a family.
And I want to.
As every year, you will be entitled to traditional animations.
Feast of the pig...
Launching pan-bagnat, watermelon race,...
..and our great ball whose theme will be revealed to you during the Egyptian buffet.
In the meantime, the Flots team wishes you a happy holiday, a beautiful buffet and sangria!
Ole!
- Mrs. Chatel?
-M.
Pic, Jessica told me everything.
Tomorrow morning, I'll settle this.
- I'm not very happy.
- Have a good night.
We'll fix it tomorrow.
All right.
- See?
The holidays will finally begin.
- I never see you at the Shogun.
- It's stupid!
- They're going from R'n'B, anyway.
Sure, on Dijon, I'm going out in more trendy boxes.
Where else are you going?
- On the weekend, I'll meet my boyfriend in Bordeaux.
- Great.
And it's moving a little bit on Bordeaux?
-Patrick found this.
Do you see where the Parisian is going to suck?
It's a beautiful inn.
- I prefer location 17.
- What?
I see you talking.
I'm reading on my lips.
I'm not a prick!
- You're calming down, Patrick!
We didn't say anything.
Your roommate's got problems with the sanitary.
-Michel!
Are you taking a shower?
- No.
- What's wrong with the belly?
- No, that's not the problem.
-Ah, okay!
Capisci!
Don't move.
Luckily, there's Patrick's safe house!
You're coming to sangria?
- No, Patrick, I told you I was tired.
- What's wrong with you?
-Patrick?
- We made Spain when I was waiting for Sébastien.
- No, Aurélie, honey.
We had your parents' caravan.
- We love Spain but too many Englishmen.
We've been here for 30 years.
- 30 years?
And why don't you buy a house here?
- We'd have to come!
- But since it's been 30 years.
- It's not the same.
Now, if we want, we can go somewhere else.
That's the camping.
- You know what?
-Michel!
Michel, are you sleeping?
Can I come in?
Can I bother you for a second?
- No.
I'm sleeping right now.
It's pretty difficult like that.
- No, but we're not gonna break your feet.
We were talking to a girlfriend.
Come on, Alexandra, show him.
To redo breasts...
Not watermelons, but small melons.
How much would it cost?
- We'll see about it tomorrow.
I'm sleeping right now.
I'm sleeping!
- I told you, he's really nice!
I love you, Alexandra.
So strong.
- Mr. Pic is requested at the reception.
Mr. Pic.
You're gonna be me.
- Two cards.
The cards said:
We're going to the beautiful one!
- I'll tell you, the future:
We're going back to Melun!
- What else?
-Chatel told me that the Dutch had booked before us and that my seniority did not allow me.
Then listen to me.
Okay.
We're staying.
But I'm changing my brawl.
For 30 years, it was nice Jacky.
But now it'll be Jacky idiot!
-Hi.
Let's go?
Wait.
Hello.
Is it okay with your car thing?
- My dad's in the garage.
- You want to come with us?
- Yeah.
But it takes someone to keep the tent.
- Except for the condoms, nothing to steal.. ..at Patrick's.
I want you to meet my friends.
I'm Aurélie Gatineau.
Nordine and Manu.
What about you?
- I'm Vanessa.
- Go ahead, Ari, turn around.
- Make it turn!
- It's smoking right now.
- Make it turn!
Again!
- Mr. Mendez...
Do you know these cars?
- Stop it, Ari!
Cut!
Okay.
I get it.
It's the intake pipe.
Come with me.
Not you!
Be careful with the puddle.
Is that James Bond's car?
The real one?
- Without accessories.
-Oh!
Oh, there...
I did Paris-Dakar with Mr.Ari Vatanen.
- It's you.
- He's my son's godfather.
I was his mechanic.
The man of the shadow.
This breakdown is funny.
We had the same thing between Agadez and Tirkou.
We had gone with my friend Ari. It was 6:00 in the morning.
And at kilometer 56, as we attacked the Dark One, a deaf noise:
It was the intake pipe!
I fixed it in two hours and we won.
How long will it take me?
- 48 hours.
It's gonna be great Mendez.
- Not two hours?
Wait, it was a 405, and I had the room.
In 48 hours, bring your suitcases.
I don't have a choice.
In 48 hours, I'm going to Portugal.
I'm Portuguese!
- Yes...
Freedom is to eat your carrots in the package.
- Don't do it all.
We only stay two days.
Come and eat.
You told me you came here every year at the campground.
- On a camping trip.
At school, camping.
See, here, it's...
It's kind of like my paradise.
I sacrifice myself 11 months of the year for my 3 weeks of happiness.
- And... on your own?
- No.
My wife and daughter are coming, I told you.
It's a lucky move, or I don't know where you'd have slept.
- And what do you do all day?
-Plage, camping, buddies.
And in the evening...
Shogun!
Wow, the box.
- Good appetite.
Thank you!
- What's wrong, Alain Delon?
- You didn't say "thank you."
-Ben for what?
- He said, "Good appetite."
- Thank you.
- Aurélie, come and see!
- We'll eat at 7:00.
- Have fun, darling.
-Vanessa!
- Where are you going?
- With the buddies.
- What friends?
Hello.
I'm Vanessa's dad.
The arrival of a little new one causes overwhelming emotions.
I'll ask you to control these emotions.
I never repeat the same thing twice.
Good beach, everyone.
I'll see you later, darling.
Be careful.
- You have nothing to fear.
She's the daughter of the Gatineaus.
Very high.
And then Aurélie's buddies are all virgins.
- Let them stay until we leave.
What are you doing?
- I was working at Amora's.
I'm from Dijon.
I was in mustard.
Now I'm in trouble!
Unemployment.
Staff compression.
But, well, I left with 4,000 euros.
There's no "Ducon" in it, anyway!
- What are you doing?
- A wasp trap.
I'm putting mint in the bottom of the bottle.
The wasp is attracted.
She can't come out anymore.
And she dies of asphyxiation.
Or diabetes because of sugar.
It's stupid, a wasp.
It's funny.
Have you ever been camping?
- No.
- That's crazy.
Hey, Paulo!
Michel, he never went camping!
- Hey, Jacky!
Michel, he's never been camping!
- No!
Hey, guys, Michel never went camping!
(All chorus) - No!
- He's never been camping!
- No!
- It's Koh Lanta for you, isn't it?
- You bet!
I spend my holidays watching him play golf!
- Not convenient?
- He's psychorigid.
And that's just the first name!
Not bad, Manu.
- He doesn't talk much.
You got a guy in Paris?
- No.
- But how do you do it?
I have one in Nantes, two in St-Nazaire.
- Are you coming?
-We're coming!
The hardest thing about surfing is standing on the board.
After that, it's a vacation.
- You're not in your place, are you?
- Hervé, are you hurrying?
He's 20 feet tall, he's taking 1:30 showers!
-Sanquill!
It's a vacation, Patrick.
-Yesterday, Sophie asked me if I had a mistress.
- You didn't answer anything?
- No, but she's smart, Gatineau.
And then I saw her again, Bunny.
- Here, Paulo, it's not a dumpling anymore.
Twice with the same one, it becomes a relationship.
Next time, you tell him:
"Finally, Sophie, not at my age!"
It always works.
I've got a lot of white hair.
32 years...
-You're 32?
- Yes, at the Shogun, for everyone, I'm 32 years old.
- Shell Relays, good night.
Yes.
A table for how many people?
I'm consulting...
What a happiness!
I have one left with a view of the pool!
Is that all right with you?
- Don't you eat?
- No.
Nice couple, don't you think?
- We're a nice couple too!
Look at them, it looks like the Gatineaus.
Paulo, how long have you not kissed me?
I mean, roll a shovel?
- I'm kissing you.
- Yeah, but you're rolling me more shovels.
And before that, you weren't eating bulots in front of me.
We'll find them in 16 years.
16 years of marriage, it's a feat.
By the way, the Berthiers divorced.
- It must be said that he...
Like, everything ends up getting to know each other.
Come on!
To our 16 years of marriage!
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you.
- You can tell me everything.
When the horse is scared, the jockey smells like it.
Maybe it's Patrick.
- It's nothing.
It's your mother who wishes us a happy birthday.
-Let me read it!
- We're having dinner.
We're not gonna rot each other's lives.
- You don't have to blame yourself?
- What are you doing with your cell phone?
Go on, give me the phone!
- It's gonna sound crazy, but I don't know this Bunny.
- Then, "Paul,...
..I'm in the area.
I'm thinking about you.
I'm waiting for your phone call, my handsome kitty eater.
Signed:
My husband's a munous eater.
With me, it's the bulots, you're putting on mayonnaise, too?
- Listen to me, honey.
I don't know Bunny.
I don't know any Bunny!
- You have someone.
- Listen, Sophie, not at my age!
-Stop it!
You sound like Patrick.
Okay.
You deny it?
Listen to me, Paul Gatineau.
Open your ears, it's gonna be a feast.
You see my ass?
You didn't touch them much, you won't touch them at all.
Bail to give in!
- Not to the Relay of the Shell!
- We're gonna pretend for the kids and because it's the holidays.
But believe me, you're gonna shit it.
You're going to shit!
You don't even know how you're gonna fuck up!
Oh, yes, I forgot something.
From now on, it's a separate tent.
-Hello anyway.
- Are you coming, honey?
I'm bored here.
I want to have fun.
- Can I come?
- No.
Starting today, Mom will take care of her.
So you see with the gentleman in the igloo.
I'm not the one you'd sleep in an igloo.
- What the hell is this?
- Are you installing the gas or what?
- I dig a laugh because it's beautiful.
- So what?
- It smells like a storm.
And if I don't dig, the water's fucking under my floor mat.
Michel, if you could avoid walking in the bedroom with your shoes...
Or do I lend you flip-flops?
Are you sure you don't want to taste Benco?
It's a delight!
Tell me, Michel, the women you're treating... you're doing it again.
You're putting me in front of Adjani's breasts or Sophie Marceau's breasts, I don't control myself anymore.
It haunted me all night, that thing.
- Are you still talking that much?
- Me, as long as I have something to say, I say it!
It's not when you die that you're gonna be able to say it.
He's not as good as Sylvie's.
You know, Michel, I miss her, my little wife.
She's coming soon.
I don't know her, but I miss her.
Mr. Chirac is requested at the reception.
- It's for me!
Must be Sylvie for my daughter!
- Your name's Chirac?
- Yes, Patrick Chirac.
Why?
-Ben...
- All right!
No, nothing like that.
We've never even met.
It's heavy to wear.
At Amora's, they called me Bernadette.
-Change of name.
- Why would I change?
-Wait!
If we want to move, how do we do it?
- You're waiting for me.
- No, if we want to move with Vanessa, do we have to take off a little bit?
-Ah!
I get it.
At the reception.
They rent scooters.
Or you're waiting for me.
- We have to get out of here fast.
- Mail?
-No, nothing.
On the other hand, Mr. Chirac, it's for your friend, the cosmetic surgeon.
He'd have to pay.
Put it on my bill.
Strange, don't let her write to me.
Jessica, don't you have a blue dress?
I had a dream with you last night.
You were in blue.
We were very, very, very in love.
Intense in love.
We had sex and you said thank you.
At the Shogun, there's a very good DJ right now.
Do you want to come?
- No.
- Hello!
Mr. Mendez!
How's it going?
Stop!
How's it going?
We're gonna win, Mr. Saint-Josse!
What a beautiful mechanic.
I could spend hours under.
On the other hand,...
..we could gain speed if I hit the transmission.
- No!
We're not going to Dakar.
- Okay, whatever you want.
Tomorrow, 9:00.
Bring your suitcases.
Here.
I'd like to introduce you.
..my wife, Sidy, from Dakar.
Honey, it's Mr. Saint-Josse.
- Hello.
- Hello.
My daughter.
- Are you sure about the transmission?
- Sure!
We don't touch it.
- Okay.
Forget it.
Too bad.
- See you tomorrow, 9:00!
- You're better off with the swings.
It's not about fashion, it's about body.
This is the model I buy from Christy.
Your husband never wants to buy you sexy things.
Now you're a bandante.
It's important to be sex at our age.
Don't forget.
- I can't see him anymore.
What a state he put my wife in...
She's totally naked!
I don't give a shit about that Bunny.
- It's going very far.
It's a hymn to his wife.
I understand Sylvie better.
That's strong.
Well, it's not easy to read.
But it's strong.
Reading is important.
I never see you read, Paulo.
- I'd better blow it up.
-But make it go away!
Get out of the way.
You're right.
We've only got one life, baby.
Besides, it's summer.
Have you ever slept with a girl?
- I never thought about it.
Yes, my heart!
Me, it's the same.
I'm not gonna stay 10 years with the 37!
- It's not bad, the cosmetic surgeon.
- That's not my style.
- Hello, Mrs. Chatel.
I'm Mr. Van Den Roy.
I wanted to tell you that you're a big...
-Hi, Jacky!
- A scooter, we're putting gas on, Michel.
I feel like you're having problems with mechanics.
- Ladies and gentlemen, for the duck race, ready?
Let's go!
- Dwarf number 20: Disqualified!
- I wish I'd done that!
- You can't do it anymore.
- Why?
- Not until you're miss camping.
- Did you sign me up?
- It's gonna be hard for the others.
- Mr. Pic, a little effort!
It's ridiculous, isn't it?
Vacations should be used to make meetings.
How's Marbella?
- Different.
Aurélie told me you were living alone.
-Patrick Chirac, number 8: Disqualified!
- Not even a little woman that cracks you?
Never?
- I'm gonna have to go.
I've got my daughter to get back.
I'll come by and say good-bye to all of you tomorrow.
Come on, good night.
- Good evening.
-Michel!
Michel!
Can I talk to you?
I was thinking about something.
You're in the medical section.
What's your name? A guy who really loves his wife... but who can't help but see others?
-A sick man.
- Yeah!
The word I didn't want to hear.
Thank you, Michel.
- I've got the balls, to leave.
I'm fine here.
- You're gonna have fun in Spain.
I dated a Spaniard.
He made me discover my G-spot.
What time did he give you?
- Ten o'clock. He's got me drunk, it's serious.
Mine, when I go out, I sleep with sleeping pills.
- Honey, let's go home.
Dad, can I stay?
- No, you greet them and we'll go home.
Come on.
- We're gonna win, Mr. Saint-Josse.
- What's going on?
José rose at 6:00 a.m. like a fury for transmission.
He slipped on an oil plate and fell into the pit!
- The transmission...
What a jerk!
You're not in Spain yet.
- Do you realize?
That's bullshit, sir!
I've been stuck here for two days!
- Please.
There's sick people here.
-How?
All right?
The assist doesn't work: the engine has been dismantled.
We're all dead laughing!
How?
Find yourself a good lawyer because mine is excellent!
- Shh...
- What?
- It's a hospital.
- So what?
- Good.
What did you decide?
Are you staying at the campground?
You've got plenty to stay in, eat.
- Can you shut up for a second?
- I'm not insisting.
Otherwise, to go to Marbella, I found you a night train.
- I'm not leaving James Bond's car.. ..chez Mendez!
This Mendez is such an asshole.
What a jerk!
Well?
- He's out of danger.
His words were for you.
- When's he coming out?
- He's got to get some rest.
- Don't fudge the milk, Michel.
You're pissed off for nothing.
My grandmother always said:
"When two tents don't touch each other, it's a driveway."
Life's not complicated.
- To the Blue Flots, to the ball, to the camping!
- And above all, when you return!
- Especially.
- I'm glad you're here!
You're a boyfriend.
- Forget the worries, my love.
Make me dream, come on!
Come dance!
- We can dance together.
It's starting to talk, Sophie.
- I don't care!
Call Bunny!
- I have to fix this moment!
Get closer!
Oh, there!
You're beautiful!
It's heavy, baby!
- Can I talk to you?
Not here.
I'm shy.
Come on.
Come on!
How am I?
-Jolie, nice, harmonious.
- What do you think of me?
- Your proportions are perfect.
-Michel, I want to change.
I'm gonna break the Codevi.
- Don't break anything, Sophie.
- You don't do campers again.
Only the actresses and the women of the world.
You don't give a shit about Nantes' color merchant!
I'm just a bitch who likes But stores!
Excuse me.
I'm unhappy and I don't know what to do with my husband.
- I'll tell you something that will surprise you.
But we can't do the world again.
You know, I did my wife again.
She left with her gym teacher.
Yeah.
She threw me away like that.
- Are you unhappy too?
- Yes.
Unhappiness is within everyone's reach.
- I was told about onion soup.
Where's it going?
Thank you, Michel.
- Mr. Saint-Josse?
Do you dance?
- No.
-Patrick, can I ask you a favor?
- Oh, fucking...
- Come on.
- We're not better here than in Menton?
- The sea is warmer.
-This is the ocean!
Stop seeing little!
- Wait, Sophie!
Can I talk to you?
Paulo, he loves you.
Bunny, this is bullshit.
- You know Bunny?
- Yes... no!
By name, by name.
- Don't get involved.
Your wife's gone.
- What are you implying?
I'm not a cheater.
- No one's fooled.
-Nobody.
- Shut up!
The neighbor in Dijon, Sophie told me about it.
- The neighbor?
That was three years ago, okay?
Nothing happened.
Let's say I cheated on her, is that a reason to break a couple with a 7-year-old?
She's not an adult.
- You don't understand the women!
Going a long way?
You can't get past Cape Ferret!
- What did she say?
- I think it's dead for tonight.
- They put it too soon, the ball, this year.
- You're making a head out of it.
It's not a rest, Blue Flots.
- I really miss my wife.
- Abandoning wife and children is wrong.
You need to change.
- It's not easy.
I see her everywhere, Sylvie.
I should go to Marbella with you.
Tongs!
Come on, Michel, a little caterpillar!
Tongs!
- We're tired of you.
You wanted to be Jacky idiot?
You've hit a mile!
You're such an asshole!
You barely say hello to people.
What do you think?
Mrs. Chatel knows what you're doing.
We all know!
The phone calls to Mrs. Chatel by taking the Dutch accent!
Listen to me, Jacky.
If it goes on, I'll put the gear back on the ball.
And it won't take 9:17 a.m. to get back to Melun!
I'm taking care of things, and tonight I'm inviting the Dutch.
I'll ask them myself if they want to change places.
I'm sick of it, I'm sick of it!
- I'll take a walk.
It'll change my mind.
I'm sick of it.
Loveless holidays are not holidays.
What about your little surfer?
Don't worry.
I'm a grave.
He's gonna let you go at 24 hours of the slide?
- No, he doesn't want to hear anything.
We're leaving tomorrow.
- Not funny, your father.
- You're right.
Since my mother left him, he's never lived with anyone else.
It's Dad's birthday, so I'd like to go buy him a present.
- What?
Is it Michel's birthday?
Let Patrick do it.
Surprise birthdays are my specialty.
He said today would be great Mendez.
24 hours.
No more.
- Better!
Gentlemen, the car is finally ready.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
You're making a head out of it.
What's the matter?
The naked want us to play naked.
We need you, Michel.
My friends from the Blue Flots don't question naturism.
But everyone doesn't have your convenience.. ..to play naked.
- We can't do it.
- It paralyzes us.
- Wait.
Each one's turn.
We always prefer you.
It's hard to play in briefs, and last year...
..we were dressed.
- You took off the brief on the pretext that you were sweating.
- In August, the brief is futile!
- Look at their modesty.
Put your principles in your pockets.
- It's naked, for smasher, it's...
- And we're irritated.
-Let's be a sport.
Dressed, not dressed: it is not the beard that makes the philosopher.
- The beard?
What beard?
- The beard...
The philosopher.
-Consultation.
- Okay.
- That's okay.
But this is the last year.
- Honey, where did you put the inflator?
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you, my daughter.
You're the prettiest.
In the name of the Blue Flots team, we offer you this beautiful bull's head.
- That's nice.
That's very nice of you.
-Original!
Vanessa told us you had a fireplace, so...
It'll remind you of Spain.
- And it can be a coat holder!
- You give him a name!
(In choir)
-A name!
- I'll give him a name, then.
I'm gonna call him Blue Flots.
So that's the Shogun.
-Hi, Patrick.
Welcome to the Shogun!
I feel very hot tonight at the Shogun!
-Patrick!
I've been waiting for you!
We were supposed to go to Marbella with your buddy!
- Sorry, Severine.
I stopped flirting.
- I'm 40 years old, a girl... and I'm going to go back to my life with my wife.
It's a new Patrick.
- A new asshole, yeah!
- Over there.
-Patrick!
There's chicks!
- They haven't made us a penguin yet.
That said, it's still early.
Good evening, the Shogun!
I said:
Good evening, the Shogun!
* -The long-awaited event will finally happen.
* Here, tonight, will be held the election of... (All chorus)
-Miss Super Camping!
- I was thinking, too...
This year, our jury will be chaired by the stage regional.
"Bernard Montiel!
Are you all right, Bernard?
- All right.
Good evening!
Bernard Montiel presents Vidéo Gag!
The tan from the first chain!
Our first candidate comes from Marseilles.
*It represents the camping des Sables d'Or. Please welcome..
Miss Catherine Ducasse!
- Wait, Sophie!
- Let go of me, 37!
* To represent the Blue Flots, coming from Châteauroux,..
Miss Christy Bergougnou!
* Speaking of Blue Flots,...
*.. I'm announced a surprise birthday.
The Shogun is honoured to welcome one of the world's greatest aesthetic surgeons!
*Isabelle Adjani's oval.
The lips..
And Daniela Lumbroso's nose.
I ask you to wish Michel Saint-Josse a very good birthday!
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.
- You're swollen, coming with your two whores.
- I'm a pinner!
- A pincer?
- Yes.
I used to be a camper who loved a charming woman and had a drugstore.
And now I'm a pinner.
A real one!
Patrick, next to me, he's a Bisounour!
- It's really good, your Damdam.
- At us, the fisherman drinks this when the boat sinks.
That way, he doesn't see himself dying.
Be careful, Mr. Pic.
It's dangerous, Damdam.
- He's right.
It's your tenth glass of Damdam.
You'll see the face you've got!
You're red!
It's like a chili!
It's time to address the problem.
Are you coming, Cornelia?
We're gonna leave the men between them.
- Good.
Cornelius, we need to talk.
Couldn't we, by chance, "echangen," as you say at home?
"Exchange" location?
You go to the 18th and I go to the 17th.
Why not tomorrow?
- You're my friend, Jacky.
No problem.
- I think we can start the aperitif.
- The winner is...
Christy Bergougnou for the Blue Flots!
-A speech!
- Hello, Arcachon.
* -Tomorrow, you will attend the election of wet t-shirt miss.
Here, in the Shogun!
- Honey, let's go.
I'm tired.
- We're leaving tomorrow.
- I'm gonna go.
- Already?
- I've got a pump.
You take care of her.
Aren't you bringing her home too late?
I'm counting on you.
Sophie, I'm here to say goodbye because I'm leaving tomorrow early.
The little colored merchant is all dark.
- My life makes me dark.
Are you taking me to Marbella?
- No.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- What's wrong with you two?
I wanted to screw him up, and I'm the one who's snuggling.
Why the fuck are you doing this for such an asshole?
- Because as long as we love, we forgive.
- That must be it, yes.
- You want it back?
Come with me.
- Have you seen Christy?
- No.
- She didn't leave without her haircut?
- Good evening.
The Blue Flots campsite, please.
-Sophie!
Sophie...
Paulo?
I'm glad.
I didn't pick up once.
I just talked to a girl.
Not very beautiful, too.
I danced without looking in the ice.
I think I'm cured.
Can we get a crescent on Arcachon?
Saint-Josse!
You can go out, you little puppy!
You okay?
Is my wife good?
Was that the treat?
Do aesthetic surgeons have plastic dicks?
Don't pretend to be asleep, Saint-Josse!
Get out!
'Cause after you hit my wife, now, you're gonna hit the guy!
You're gonna hit Paulo!
It's not gonna be the same lemonade!
It doesn't last long with Paulo, so come on!
Come on!
- Poor fool.
Poor bastard, he's got more class than that.
- Van Den Roy, he's your friend Jacky.
Cornelius!
How you doing, buddy?
I'm here for the exchange.
You, location 18.
Me, 17.
Like we said yesterday.
-Yesterday?
I didn't say anything.
Nothing said, Jacky.
Be careful.
Not good, Damdam.
Not good.
-Ah.
All right.
I get it.
- Good night, Jacky.
- It's the cherry that makes the vase overflow!
- Are you sure he offered you the exchange?
-You're not going to do it!
He walked me with his Damdam.
He wants a walk?
He's gonna get some!
- What's wrong?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Mom's here, Dad's here.
Sophie, I need to tell you something.
Bunny, that's right.
There you go.
- Here you go.
- What do you mean?
- When did you sleep with that whore?
- It doesn't matter.
A girl who sleeps with a married guy, she's a bitch!
So when?
-Ah!
Titounet, that's good!
That's good, what you're doing.
Can you give it to me?
- Yeah, give Dad the shovel.
He loves shovels!
When?
- On New Year's Day.
The night I was dying in my bed?
Did you see her again?
- No.
You're lying, Paulo.
Anyway, it's the first time that matters.
Paulo, you do whatever you want.
But tell your Bunny that Elmer the hunter is on his track and that it's better for her to hibernate.
- Guys, good-bye.
I'm leaving the Blue Flots.
- Already?
-Look at: "At the Shogun, election of Miss Super Camping..
Christy Bergougnou, queen of one night."
I'm sick.
- Why?
- Is that what you're doing?
-Look closer.
Hand on his ass!
- You bastard!
Boyer is the nudist!
- Yeah.
- I knew it!
I knew it!
He wants to destabilize us for the volleyball game.
I'm telling you:
Hunt the naturist, he's coming back to the bungalow.
- I'll leave it to you.
You'll give it to Jacky, he'll put his ice on it.
Have a nice holiday!
-Hi, 37!
- Guys, I've already told you:
My name is Gabi.
-Shit!
Shit!
What's going on?
- I don't know.
He's sleeping.
- But yesterday, he was on fire!
- He was on morphine, that's all.
- Under morphine?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
- Hold on.
There he is.
Look how fragile he is.
We won't see Portugal this year.
- It's true that your husband looks like nothing.
I'll give you a confidence.
I feel like he doesn't know how to mount the engine.
It's getting mixed up.
I shouldn't tell you...
- Well, don't say it, then!
- Do you have any money?
What time is your bus?
- Yes, Dad.
I'm leaving in half an hour.
- Hello, Mr. Michel.
- Hello, sir.
Enjoy.
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, why?
- It's shit.
- What?
- There's more Benco.
Not at Carrefour, not at the supermarket.
- What about Champion's?
-No more Benco anywhere.
- With all these campsites...
Don't run out of milk.
I'll drink Nesquik.
Mr. Saint-Josse is requested at the reception.
- Mr. Vatanen!
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Vatanen.
Bravo, bravo, bravo!
He says she's turning like a clock and that Mr. Mendez is a genius.
I'm just translating.
-Patrick!
You've got a courier.
- What's going on?
- I'm a loser!
It's a grotesque good-for-nothing.
And my wife, she's right.
I'm useless.
I'm useless!
- Maybe it'll get better.
- Is it gonna be okay?
You bet!
See, we're trying, we're doing everything we can to change.
And that's how we get rewarded!
-Patrick, shit...
-Vanessa, honey, let's go!
Dad, we can't leave today.
I'm going to Hossegor.
Tell your surfer we're going to Marbella.
Excuse me.
But I can't take it anymore, from Cro-Magnon, barbecues, Shogun.
I'm at the end right now.
I don't want to look like the other happy fool.
That horrible bull's head, she's staying here.
I'm getting out of here.
It's time I thought about myself.
It's my vacation, too!
Vanessa!
Vanessa!
Haven't you seen Vanessa?
Answer me!
What the hell?
What the hell is that?
It's us, the village of Cro-Magnon.
Are we cheap?
I heard everything!
What would you have done without us?
The Cro-Magnon, he opened his hut for you!
You can take your grand airs as a surgeon.
The king of silicone!
But you're doing nothing but nipples!
Tits, Saint-Josse!
I have the satellite in Dijon too.
I have 250 TV channels in Dijon, the mustard town!
Did you see each other?
"The water is too cold!"
"I don't want Benco!"
"Mosquitoes are stinging!"
Me, uh...
I don't have James Bond's car, but it works, and every day!
And then your daughter...
You didn't see that she was in love because you don't know what love is.
You're a scumbag, Saint-Josse.
A scumbag!
- We have to get a ticket!
- I'll get my daughter.
Come on, Vanessa, let's go.
- No.
I'm staying here.
You didn't see Patrick's unhappy.
I don't see anything.
Don't worry.
The camper bounces.
Come on, come on.
- You're an egoist!
You're not looking at anyone.
You only think about yourself!
I understand why Mom left you.
You're gonna be alone!
You're a jerk!
A big jerk!
We don't call his father a jerk, anyway.
No?
- Thank you, Dad.
- Don't worry!
I'm coming!
One word, one gesture and Jacky does the rest!
You're lucky.
Thank you, thank you!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
-Jacky, my friend, ask me now what you want.
- It's coming!
It's okay!
Come on, let's get back!
Stop!
- You're good here.
- I feel like the holidays are finally going to start!
-Patrick, are you coming?
We're celebrating the rescue of the Dutch.
- Leave me alone.
I'm just a loser.
I can't do anything with her life.
How have you been since last year?
Someone told me...
- It's getting up.
It's a weird story.
What were our Dutch friends doing on sands that are forbidden?
- They're banned in November, Mom.
-No way!
My shrimp!
- There's Aunt Igloo running away!
- Mom!
Dad!
Paulo!
Paulo!
Paulo!
My love...
My wife has contractions!
- I can't do anything!
Firefighters and paramedics are overwhelmed.
The roof of the church of Arcachon collapsed.
- She's giving birth.
Find a doctor!
- Yes, but I'm calling everywhere!
All right, I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it!
Don't worry, Cornelia.
The doctor's coming.
Blow!
- Breathe, darling.
- Get out.
Cornelius, you're gonna help me.
- Yes.
-Patrick, you're gonna get me a towel, a knife and a stove.
Let's go.
- His name's Jacky!
- General couch!
-Bravo, Michel!
- Yeah!
Bravo!
-Jacky!
It's really a special year.
Thank you, the Blue Flots, for making me understand one thing.
When two tents don't touch each other, it's a nice driveway.
- A cup before you leave, Michel?
- No, Jacky, thank you.
- Have a nice holiday, Michel.
- You too, Sophie, have a good holiday.
As for you, Patrick, I think you're an attaching person.
I'm sure your wife will come back.
He must miss you.
I called my brother.
He's looking for guys to sell agendas.
So it's not heaven, but it's work.
Come on, hi.
Are you coming, honey?
Thanks for the job.
But in September, I have to go to Uzès.
It's still Indian summer over there.
Take care of yourself, Patrick.
- See you next year!
