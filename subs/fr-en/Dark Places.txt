I love you, Libby.
I love you, honey.
Don't ever forget it.
Libby, what you're going to tell us is extremely important.
Ben killed your mother and sisters?
You were there when it happened.
Then tell us.
It's Ben.
He killed them, didn't he?
I have a darkness inside me.
As alive as an organ.
Today it's Day blood.
He's got something wrong.
I was eight on the night of the murders and suddenly, I was famous.
The little orphan of the Kansas Prairie massacre.
I've received donations from strangers.
Just enough to do nothing.
I didn't bother.
How much is left?
Do you read the records I sent you?
It happens to me.
Did you at least listen to my messages?
How much?
There's $482.12 left on the account in your name.
Like I told you before, if you had managed to feed him with any kind of salary, we could have kept him.
And you owe two months' rent.
What about the book?
He should've brought more money.
- I know.
- New donations?
It's almost the 30th anniversary.
People have moved on.
There are still new murders, other girls to help.
And you have to admit, you're no longer one.
I'm not ready.
But if we think about it, it might be positive for you.
Your life could take a new turn.
What do you want to do when you grow up?
Are you kidding me?
Jim Jeffreys used to give me boxes overflowing with mail.
Especially letters with cheques.
In exchange, I was sending a typical answer with my big square writing:
"Thank you for your gift.
"Thanks to you, I can look forward to a brighter future.
"Friendly, "Libby Day."
You're Lyle Wirth?
Who's asking?
Libby Day, you wrote to me.
The cow!
Libby Day?
Are you in town?
What do you mean, what city?
Kansas City, is that where you live?
Yes, I live in Kansas City.
Is your offer serious?
Lyle Wirth had a serial killer head.
So he was probably harmless.
Lyle?
Libby?
Were you expecting someone else?
Libby Day, it's amazing to meet you...
All right, let's calm down.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
I wonder why we're meeting in a laundromat in the middle of the night.
Don't get me wrong.
It belongs to me.
I have two.
I'm a boss.
- Can I get you something?
- Like laundry?
- I was thinking about a coffee.
- Keep your distance, damn it!
Do you know the vital space?
Tell me about your club.
Some collect sports cards, others like people magazines and know all about stars, from their baby's name to their hometown.
We're the same, but for the murders.
The Kill Club.
It's not that weird.
We're a group of people passionate about various things.
We all have a favorite case.
Your family is a huge thing for us.
I mean, it's tragic, what happened.
Your brother's been in prison for 28 years...
If you want to convince me that Ben is innocent, you're wasting your time.
Just come and see, we're organizing some kind of convention.
How much?
$500.
And there'll be a lot of collectors.
I want $1,000.
700 and you answer our questions about what happened.
All right.
Yeah, sold.
What about breakfast?
Aren't you hot with your hat?
Stop yelling, girls.
Hey, Ben.
Hey, Libby.
- I like your salt hill.
Mom, Ben and Libby are making mistakes.
It's nothing.
Michelle, the orange juice.
Mom, Libby stole my pancake!
Ben, you want some eggs?
Mom, Ben keeps his hat.
It's not even cool.
Michelle's right.
Well, take it off.
It's not good at the table.
Looks like one of the vampires in his heavy metal posters.
Why?
It's just a dye, don't panic.
See you later.
I had already been paid for conferences or meetings.
I had all kinds of twisted proposals.
You want candy, little girl?
Welcome.
Welcome to our club!
Shall I show you around?
I want my money.
Come on, I'll take you upstairs.
The Kill Club, KC for intimates, brings together fans of famous puzzles and murders.
From Fanny Adams to the killer...
Who's Fanny Adams?
An 8-year-old girl depopulated in England in 1867.
The candy guy downstairs incarnates his murderer, Frederick Baker.
Anything...
Guys, let's get out of here a little bit.
We'd do with role-playing, but it's a lot of fun.
Besides, it's financing us.
- "We"?
- The elucidators.
We take this very seriously.
There are ex-cops, private detectives, lawyers...
We're elucidating crimes.
Out of passion.
Lyle!
Who's your young friend?
Bob Berdella, this is Libby Day.
The Kansas farm massacre was his family.
If you had a dick, you'd be in my trash.
Except what I put in the chili.
Don't touch me, you crazy bastard.
- I'm kidding.
- Very funny.
You pig!
We've had fights before, but never so weird.
- I'm out of here.
- No, please.
I don't want to do it anymore.
I understand that you're getting rid of it right now, but we're not all like this.
Let me convince you.
Come over here.
Private detectives have spotted a serial killer.
They're gonna catch him soon.
It crosses Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, to help people die.
What do you mean?
It's the Angel of the Indebted.
It's a kind of euthanasist for overindebted people, desperate but with good life assurance.
You'll like our group.
We don't have costumes.
Good evening.
This is our guest, this year's Kill Club star,
Libby Day.
At approximately 2 a.m. on 13 October 1985, one or more individuals killed three members of the Day family on their farm in Kinnakee, Kansas.
The last one, Libby, escaped through a window in his mother's room.
The elder, Benjamin, never gave an alibi and was very uncooperative with the police.
Libby testified that he saw Ben commit the murders.
Despite Libby's confused words and young age, and despite the blatant lack of material evidence,
Ben Day was condemned, on the basis of rumours that he was engaging in satanism.
Is it okay?
Many think it's Runner Day, his father, the culprit.
He's trying to get some money out of Patty, he's refusing, he's breaking up.
He was crazy, wasn't he?
Yes.
I don't know.
He left when I was two.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
The blood on Michelle's bed doesn't belong to the family.
But they were recuperation sheets, blood could come from elsewhere.
We were poor, we lived to get back.
Do you remember any unusual details that day?
Like?
Your mother's reaction to Krissi Cates.
- Who?
- Krissi Cates.
I don't know who he is.
- It's in your book.
- I didn't write it.
I didn't even read it.
What about Trey Teepano?
And Ben Day, I'm talking about him?
Please, this is the worst judicial error in history!
- Where did she come from?
- Magda's campaigning for Ben's release.
He's wonderful.
He's drawing poems.
Get to know him, really.
In three weeks, it'll be too late.
To clarify this crime, we need new elements.
And you might think about retracting when we ask for a review of the trial.
But time is running out.
What do you mean?
Because of a lack of budget, there's going to be a restructuring, and the old files will be thrown away.
In other words, in three weeks, Ben's will be destroyed.
"A group of people passionate about criminal investigations"?
Libby, Ben's innocent.
He didn't even appeal!
He had enough to make eight, but he lost hope.
Good.
Help us.
- Keep your conspiracy theory.
- Wait.
- Don't go.
Try to convince us!
She's a liar and a liar.
That's what you've always been.
A liar!
You don't know anything about that night.
All as much as you are.
Run!
They're dead!
In drawing class I met Ben
I knew from her heart, I'd be queen.
He has big blue eyes and a bright complexion.
Are you in?
It's Saturday, you're in my mind.
Guess who it is.
Do you have a friend here?
Him.
Do you know that kid?
No, I don't go to college.
Fuck you.
He's getting upset.
So what, man?
- Do we know each other?
- I'm a friend of Trey's.
Liar!
That crazy Indian doesn't have any friends.
Is he really Indian?
He's an asiate.
I think he's, what do they say?
It's a mixture.
Her papy alcoholo raped a Chinese whore?
Watch out, Trey's got creepy delusions.
Satanic.
Yeah, we do violent stuff.
You're killing cows, too?
We have to.
It's an order.
That's bullshit.
What about my hamburger?
The head he's making!
Death is sometimes necessary.
We have to kill.
Just as Jesus demands sacrifices... Satan also.
- Mom, is Ben in trouble?
- No, he's fine.
- Are you sure?
- Why are you insisting?
- I heard rumors.
- But again?
Mom, there's a car coming!
Who's that?
Hello!
Thank you.
Who's the little spy?
It's Libby.
She has her mother's big blue eyes.
Your family's from Ireland?
From Germany.
Young lady's name, Krause.
Like Arkansas City's farmer.
Last summer, his hopper dropped, he took two tons of wheat on his head.
Poor guy suffocated before we could get him out of here.
- I know about that.
- He was going to go bankrupt.
He owed the Agricultural Aid Fund a lot of money.
It's Saturday, is there a problem?
They're gonna grab it.
Why now?
The courts are falling apart.
The harvest has been too abundant, but it can change.
You'll never be able to pay back.
I'll sell animals, equipment.
Beasts are worthless.
You're almost out of machines.
There must be a solution.
- The bank...
- She's bankrupt, too.
I'm so sorry.
They want us dead.
I don't know who they are.
But only money can save you.
Quit begging, borrowing or stealing.
There's no pride left, Patty.
What you're going to tell us is extremely important.
Ben killed your mother and sisters?
You were there when it happened, so tell us.
He killed them, didn't he?
I've been thinking.
If I did a little investigation, would your club compensate me?
- Have you changed your mind?
- No, for me, Ben's the killer.
But I need money.
I'm offering you three weeks of my life in exchange.
It's not very noble.
Forget it.
Wait, Libby.
You're not talking to Runner anymore?
It would be nice to contact him.
Even if I don't suspect it.
- What's your hypothesis?
- I'll keep it to myself.
But if Ben's innocent, why is he doing nothing to get out?
Go ask her.
First the others.
Is it because of the money?
I don't like wasting my time.
Let's say... $300?
Where'd it come from?
As treasurer, I have discretion.
I choose to finance this project.
Does that make you laugh?
A "noble" embezzlement is funny.
It makes you almost friendly.
- I need another $500, ahead of time.
- Why?
To pay that garage boy.
He's been sequestering my car for six months.
I need it.
- I'm counting on you.
- Yeah, I know.
Go see Ben.
- It all starts with him.
- It all ends with him.
He killed them.
- Seriously, Libby...
- All right, I'll go see him!
To make you wrong, you crazy bastards.
And make Magda's bitch cry.
I think I saw Ben while I was on the threshold of my mom's room.
He was threatening her with our shotgun.
Satan urges us to satisfy our desires.
At the bottom, we're all animals.
Please!
Quiet.
Benjamin, do you understand the gravity of the situation?
Hey, Libby.
Hey, Ben.
I never thought I'd see you again.
I never thought I'd come.
But you have fans outside.
They see you as the victim.
I've been thinking a lot about you all these years.
I heard from you, but it's not the same.
How's it going here?
It's okay.
I've passed my grad.
I'm even studying English literature.
I'm fucking reading Shakespeare!
That's good.
Libby, you're too beautiful.
You have Mom's eyes.
Do we tell you that often?
Who would tell me that?
Runner's gone, I don't know where.
Diane's dead.
I don't have anyone.
We should've taken better care of you.
Did you find faith?
Are you friends with Jesus?
Why are you so nice?
I'm not nice.
I blame a lot of people.
But not you.
What?
You're different.
What I imagined.
This parlor is for those sentenced to death.
We could see each other in the big room.
Unless you asked.
Remember Yellow?
Yellow?
The horse that refused to be mounted.
- He bit you?
- No, I thought I had it.
He ejected me against the fence and I got a nail.
Runner came to see you?
Do you know where he is?
His last letter came from Bert Nolan's men's home in Oklahoma.
He asked me for $500 for his research for my release.
Damn Runner!
What's with the tattoo?
An ex.
We started by writing to each other.
I thought I was in love, I thought we were married.
Do you have a guy?
Stop.
I won't let you.
You can't.
You don't have the right to ask me questions.
My little sister shows up after all these years and I'm thinking maybe, well, it's gonna work out.
I won't feel so alone anymore.
Talking about a fucking horse is all I'm asking for.
I don't remember the horse.
Yellow?
It was an old canasson, but it was yours.
- I forgot.
- You were little when Mom sold it.
Regrettably, for needing money.
I've got a lot of stories about him.
Go ahead, ask the question.
You don't have to.
- I know you killed them.
I was the only boy at home.
In high school, I was the invisible kid.
In court, I was scared, I imposed it.
Because you killed your family.
I was a moron, but I didn't kill Mom, Debby and Michelle.
Why didn't you ever call?
You like it here, you want to stay?
You want my opinion?
You're just talking bullshit.
It looks great on you.
I knew it.
Don't you think I'm too old for you?
17-year-old chicks aren't your type.
Come on.
Come on.
Concentrate.
Is that all you got?
I saw some friends at the mall.
You know little Krissi Cates?
From the drawing class where I support.
You never told me about this class, Ben.
I'm just helping kids, that's all.
A former teacher asked me.
I hear the cops are looking for you.
You would've done some bad stuff to girls.
Everybody's calling you a freak.
What the hell is this?
I love you.
The baby's moving.
It's Aunt Diane!
Go get the rest, there are surprises.
You didn't have to.
That's why I'm here.
You okay?
The vultures are wandering.
It's too much.
I love this land.
It's like loving a child.
You don't know what it is, a very intense feeling.
I love seeing it grow and produce, and reproduce.
You can't work 24 hours a day, Patty.
All by yourself, you were screwed up in advance.
You should have gone, like me.
Studying.
- It's the family farm.
But it's time to let her go.
I don't see Ben.
He left early this morning.
How's it going with him?
It's not easy.
Where is he?
I don't know, why?
What do you think, it's a boy or a girl?
How would I know?
You mean you don't care?
No, I don't care.
I've been thinking about girl names.
What are you telling me?
Not yet.
Are you sure Michelle doesn't know?
She didn't say anything.
She's a little snoop.
- If I catch him, this one...
- Shut up.
I promised my father, Ben.
If he knows I'm no longer a virgin, he kills me.
Then tell that curious little girl to shove more of me at school.
Before he found out.
It's Trey!
Get out of here.
You don't know my father.
You don't know what he's capable of.
We should run before my parents return.
Really?
That's it?
- What?
- How are you gonna feed us?
You'll need a job.
Or ask Runner for money.
My father?
He wins.
He's doing crafts, small jobs.
- On farms.
- Are you kidding me?
What did you expect?
Trey, Ben doesn't know what his father's doing!
Poor little shit.
Don't you know about your father?
Are you kidding me?
Well, that's your old man's weed.
Are you delirious?
Frickin' and too expensive.
He got it in Texas.
Let's go see Runner, honey.
It's about getting enough money to get out of here.
Teenagers are playing a worrying new game:
Satanism.
They draw the symbols, they idolize the stars of heavy metal whose albums are full of demonic images.
Obsessed with violence and death, they commit horrors, such as human sacrifices or acts of paedophilia.
We're in the middle of a satanic era...
The police, judges and psychiatrists saw satanists everywhere.
Wrong?
Some sick teens who were listening to too much metal, maybe.
But true criminals worshiping Satan?
What does the report say?
The crime scene was polluted.
There's been a lot of aisles and comings, everybody didn't care.
They held the perfect culprit: A strange and unloved kid who was a heavy metal fan.
Take a look at our files.
It's not optional.
Really?
You're hoping for Ben's release more than he is, it's ridiculous.
- What did you think of him?
- I don't know.
To your knowledge, did he have a serious story?
With a Molly or Polly, a name like that?
No, it doesn't ring a bell.
It's probably pointless.
It's tattooed on his arm.
Probably another Magda.
Are you going to tell me?
Tell me who you suspect.
I think Lou Cates is the culprit.
Krissi Cates' father.
History of violence, assault prison.
You still don't know who Krissi is?
I know, it's hard, but try.
Make an effort.
You're smart, you'll see it doesn't fit.
Read the file.
You'll see.
Please.
Since I was seven, I've only had fleeting images of Ben.
Like an evil being in a haunted house.
I forgot the Ben of the past, my brother.
Timid.
Seriously.
Who wouldn't have done what he was accused of.
Which I accused him of.
Between the attack on Krissi and the murders, no connection had been established.
But the rumor spread, the jury was against him.
Oddly enough, the girls backtracked and the Cates never filed a complaint.
The Kill Club had located Mrs. Cates in Emporia, Kansas, but she did not call them back.
When you want to reach someone, you don't leave a message.
We insist, over and over again, until the other picks up, motivated by anger, curiosity or fear.
I'm sorry, am I waking you up?
I didn't realize the time.
I can call later.
Who is it?
My name is Stephanie Adams, I'm a friend of Krissi's...
Damn it, you won't let go until you get what you want.
I don't know what you're talking about.
We were friends.
Would you help me find her?
- What's your name?
- Yes, Sally Adams.
I've been doing my life again and we're not in touch anymore.
I see.
Don't you have Lou's number, by any chance, or an address?
Lou must be in a bar in Kansas, I guess.
To find Krissi, take Route I-70 west at the exit of Columbia.
Turn left to the huge strip club.
She'll be there.
Don't call me anymore.
Mrs. Day, serious charges have been laid against your son.
Are you all right in high school?
Is he sociable?
He's got a lot of friends.
I hear he's a loner.
So what?
You have four children?
The same father?
Mrs. Day, four girls claim that Ben touched their intimate parts.
He reportedly took them to a farm for acts associated with satanic rituals.
A farm?
Ben doesn't even have a car.
You don't know him.
Devil worship is quite widespread.
He has been insinuating himself throughout society, and some rituals are to defuse children.
Do you have any evidence, witnesses?
More than 12 years?
We have the little words of Ben to Krissi Cates.
We need to talk to a lawyer.
Abuse often begins in the home.
Mrs. Day, you have three daughters.
Mrs. Cates?
I'm Patty Day, Ben's mother.
She's Ben Day's mother.
Can you show me with these dolls exactly what happened?
Krissi?
I'm Patty Day.
Ben's mom.
I don't want to see her!
You promised me!
We're not safe!
We know everything about you.
Four kids, no money.
The father's a drunk or worse.
You're getting social assistance.
You're at the soup kitchen, and divine kindness, you let your son do this!
You're not hiding it, I hope.
The police are looking for him.
I swear to God, too.
Ben's going to hell!
Krissi?
- Can we talk?
- About what?
- It's about Ben Day.
Willingness.
Who's she?
Libby.
She's with me.
What are you drinking?
Double vodka cranberry.
Same thing.
Ben Day, so...
He screwed up my life.
Do you maintain that he assaulted you?
I was eleven, he was sixteen.
He came to talk to me after school.
He wasn't the only one.
I was cute.
And freckled.
Go on.
He was taking me to a school, forcing me to do blowjobs and swear fidelity to Satan.
Give me some chips.
Don't you mind?
Anyway, Ben was sneaky with me.
There was an altar inside.
A crucifix backwards, dead animals, sacrificial stuff.
I think he was about to kill me, but he went after his family.
They were all satanists.
How did your father react when he heard what Ben did to you?
He was covering me.
He broke a cable.
I think if he had found Ben, he would have killed him and the Day would still be alive.
Is your father around?
We lost sight of each other.
Can you lend me 20 bucks?
Do you have his address?
I just told you no.
I know, but if you...
Go pay the bill.
How much do you want?
Come on, let's say $50.
I'll pay you back, I promise.
I have a pen, write me your address.
Here.
My name is Libby Day, you lying whore.
Don't lose her.
Home Bert Nolan.
I'm trying to reach a guy named Runner or Ronald Day.
Is he home?
Intermittently.
I can take a message.
Ask him to call me back.
I'm Libby Day.
It's pretty important.
Tell him I need to talk to him about Ben and that night.
"Ben and that night."
That night...
That night.
I've always been sleepwalking.
And mom wasn't bronchising when I climbed into her bed.
But that night, she turned to me and told me she loved me.
She almost never said it.
It made a big difference to me.
I never dwell on these thoughts.
I gave a name to these memories, as if it were a dangerous area.
The Shadow Zone.
Michelle's diary.
I forgot she'd sniff her nose all over the place.
In the end, she treats Ben's girlfriend, Diondra, as a "malignant bitch."
I don't remember Ben having a girlfriend.
I'm an unworthy mother.
What are you talking about?
You're Superwoman, if you want my advice.
Your farm stands up, your four kids go to school, and you don't carbide in the bourbon to hold.
No, this cop's right.
If it were better at home, Ben wouldn't be here.
He's got a good bottom.
Sometimes I think I'd better disappear.
What about the kids?
They'd live with you.
They'd be better off in Kansas City.
Their father's a sick man, and I'm a loser.
It's Runner's car.
You want me to come?
No, it's okay.
Mom!
Dad's here!
He brought us donuts!
You don't have to pay more attention than a great predator.
You don't have to open up to anyone in my absence.
- It's Dad.
- He's leaving.
Stop!
We need to talk.
I'm not in the mood.
Vern Everlee told me you sold the farmer.
The money leaves as fast as he gets home, you should know.
You're never as broke as you say.
- I need something to go to Texas.
- I don't have anything.
Patty, I'm in trouble.
It's a question of life or death.
- I'm in a black shit.
- All right?
Ben's in big trouble.
It's serious.
He needs a lawyer.
So you have money.
No, I don't.
A lawyer is expensive.
Do you have any jewelry?
What about the ring?
My engagement ring?
It's a joke, or I'd have sold it.
What about this?
They're real rubies, aren't they?
It's my grandmother's cross.
You're gonna regret it, Patty.
I've been sorry for a long time.
Hey, girls.
Your mom's a dirty whore.
Thanks for nothing, bitch!
We'll only open in an hour.
I'm sorry, honey.
It's a men's home.
I'm looking for someone:
Runner Day.
- Are you the manager?
- Manager, accountant, chaplain.
But he's gone.
Alcoholic people are excluded, it was the third time.
Do you know where he is?
I bet he's squatting at the toxic waste site.
It's an old anti-salter product dump, stuffed with arsenic.
Prepare to be disappointed.
I didn't know how to take it.
That my own father lives in a toxic landfill.
- Don't even think about it.
- Put the gun down.
She's your daughter!
Prove it.
I can't prove it.
Oh, my God, come down.
Come on, come on, come on!
- Don't touch me.
- Daddy's got you.
- Get out!
- Like when you were a kid.
Say thumb!
- Let go of me!
- Say thumb...
Inch!
Goddamn it!
How long have I not seen you?
Do you still have the flamingo ashtray I gave you?
When I was ten and I didn't smoke.
He was pretty, wasn't he?
You know why I'm here.
You have to tell the truth about the murders.
Ben wasn't a saint.
Fricoting with the devil, it gets paid sooner or later.
I should have been suspicious when I saw him with that red skin.
- Who?
- Trey Teepano.
It's crazy, no one knows what really happened.
Who got the money?
Not me, for sure.
- We didn't have any money.
- Your mother did.
The queen of bitches.
Where's Patty's life insurance?
I didn't touch anything.
It paid Ben's lawyer.
I've been working on this farm for years, so I can't do anything.
That bitch even asked me for a pension!
Is that what happened?
Did you go grab him some money?
Did it degenerate?
What I'm trying to tell you is that Trey was a bookie asking for his money.
Why, did you owe him?
You want everything for free.
But you wrote a book.
You have to be shielded with money.
You're armored.
Get the fuck off of me!
Am I scaring you?
Where were you that night, Runner?
I don't remember anything.
Finally, she was found, Diedre?
Are you talking about Diondra?
I wonder if they killed her.
What are you talking about?
That's their thing, isn't it?
To the worshipers of the devil.
Killing pregnant girls with their baby.
Runner.
Come and see.
I don't have your money, man.
I scraped the drawer bottoms, I swear.
I don't have anything.
Hey, honey.
Aren't you gonna say hello?
Diondra, I'm missing all my homework.
I see clearer to drown my worries in alcohol too much.
I don't get it, Runner.
You had a lot of grass not so long ago.
I didn't make you pay.
With everything you owe me!
Another one who never wants to steal.
Don't exaggerate, Trey.
I know another one who needs money.
Look at that black hair.
You owe Trey money, too?
No, I don't owe him anything.
It's for her girl.
Tomorrow night.
Right here.
Or my word, Runner, you'll feel it passing.
Wait, I have something to tell you.
I put Diondra... she's...
I got her pregnant, we're having a baby.
Make sure it's yours.
Because I don't think so.
Why would an ace-packed slut get a loser like you?
Think about it.
Are you okay, honey?
Some of them deserve to die.
Do you have any?
In the glove box.
What's that?
The Devil's Trip.
Have you ever taken any?
No, I don't need it.
You're gonna need it.
Tonight, you're going to be a man.
Maybe.
No, I want the axe!
It's too heavy for you.
He's sharp, don't mess with me.
To you, Satan, we offer these sacrifices, suffering, blood, fear... anger.
The foundation of life.
Your power strengthens us.
This one.
Your glorification exalts us.
Your baby's gonna become a warrior tonight, Dio!
Come on, don't stay here!
It's your turn, you have to kill!
Take your chance to become a man.
I've been like you.
I don't want to go back.
Don't be a soft dick your whole life!
Aren't you tired of being afraid?
Come on!
- You trust Runner?
- No, no one.
How much?
How much do they pay you?
I don't understand.
- You think I didn't know that?
- Yeah, I got paid.
- But that's more about it.
- Is that for the truth?
You lose every time.
If I'm innocent, that means you ruined my life, sis.
If I'm guilty, you won't feel any better.
- Where's Diondra?
- Forget it.
- What happened to the baby?
- What baby?
- Are you kidding me?
- Forget it.
What about Trey Teepano?
He said what he had to say at the trial.
Too easy.
Listen to me.
Today, I can forgive your lie.
You were a messy little girl.
But you're a fucking grown-up now.
Do you really think we have this in our blood?
I'm sure we have this in our blood.
I've been beating people, smashing doors and windows, killing things.
Most of the time, my fists are tight.
- You think we're so bad?
- Yes.
Even with Mom's blood?
Even.
You're hurting me.
Fuck you.
You think that's funny?
No, it's ironic.
What?
You're in jail, too.
- It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
- No.
I want Ben back.
Why can't we find him?
Is he in trouble because of his hair?
No, something sexual.
The whole school is talking about it.
What are you talking about?
Don't say any harm to your brother.
But I don't like Ben.
He's mean.
He's doing bad things.
He touched you weirdly, not like a brother?
He only touches me to push or pull my hair.
Mom, he's not normal.
It's a shame, he's got twisted stuff in his room.
You snooped in his room?
Patty?
It's Joseph from the Agricultural Aid Fund.
I don't have the money.
I've had a tough day.
Yeah, I heard about Ben.
I hesitated to call.
I trust you.
I pray for you.
Maybe I have a solution.
I thought I was running out of options.
Not quite.
Diondra Sue Wertzner, born on 28 March 1968, was officially reported missing on 19 October 1985.
No one's seen her.
What does that mean, she's dead?
It's hard to know.
Ben didn't say anything?
Wait.
I promised to pay back.
By reading your name...
I should've recognized you right away, so I followed your story, but it's dated.
What do you want?
You're not making it easy for me...
It's a good war.
I was pretty.
And good student.
Ben was teaching support.
I'm in the process of drawing.
I was totally spitting for him.
We started talking.
We were kids, but he was older.
He shouldn't have encouraged me.
That was my first real kiss.
It only lasted a second.
Of course, after that, he told me we wouldn't do it anymore, because it was wrong.
He was still writing me little words, but he refused to spend time with me.
I was furious.
A week later, I went to a pajamas party, and I talked to the girls about my high school boyfriend.
I'm very proud.
I said we did things and it was a snowball.
We invented an imaginary world where Ben was a satanist.
We were seeing reports about it every day, at the time...
Ma'am.
Your son is wanted and I know why.
You need money to keep your kids home.
And you need a good lawyer.
To prevent your son from being incarcerated for paedophilia.
What are you proposing?
I was a farmer, too.
Like my father and his father before him.
The rest of us, we've been rolled.
We were told to exploit each plot and buy more land before everything was taken.
And suddenly, "I'm sorry, we didn't advise you.
"We'll grab your farm."
What does that have to do with my son?
Ma'am, I'm not a businessman.
Not a judge.
And much less a politician.
But if you have the guts, I'll give you a chance to help your family.
Your brother needs you.
He clearly told me the opposite.
Now that you know the case, you don't think Ben deserves a new trial?
On what elements?
What do we know?
He's lying about Diondra.
Everyone's lying.
I lied to get you to the KC.
You lied on the stand, it doesn't make us murderers.
How are you so sure I lied?
Why are you obsessed with this case?
It's not your story, it's mine.
It's a captivating riddle, full of assumptions.
And most of all, there's you, Ben, Krissi...
Children overwhelmed by the events they triggered.
It fascinates me.
Does that mean the forest fire in San Bernardino in 1999?
It destroyed 80 houses and 35,000 hectares.
It burns all the time in California.
I'm the one who started the fire.
Shouldn't you have been a firefighter to overcome the trauma?
So it's true?
What?
You lied in court?
Can I help you?
We're looking for Trey Teepano.
You found him.
This is Ben Day, brother.
You're the survivor.
Debby?
Libby.
Remember Runner Day?
He says you were a bookie.
Runner owed me a lot of money.
That's still the case, by the way.
But I don't know what happened.
You were a satanist?
I've repented since then.
I'm a good Christian little Indian.
Do you remember Diondra Wertzner?
Your brother, he was crazy about her.
She was delivered to herself, so she played divas.
She was running, she was coming home.
A real circus.
She ended up running away for good.
She's been missing for 25 years.
She was always trying to be someone else.
It took the English accent one day, the Southern accent the next day.
- She was using her porn nick.
- She was doing X?
It was a game.
The name of your first domestic animal?
Gracie, the street where you lived?
Rural road 2.
It's not working.
It's supposed to be a bitch, like...
Bambi Evergreen.
Diondra's was Polly Machin Thing...
Polly Palm.
What's Ben's tattoo?
Polly, right?
I've got it in Kearney, Missouri.
The only one in the country, except a nail shop in Shreveport.
I'm not feeling well.
I have to eat.
What?
You're screwed.
Hey, it's Megan.
I'm freaking out about Ben Day.
You know he assaulted girls?
Diondra, it's Jenny.
They say Ben's on the run.
You're not with him, are you?
Tell me you don't!
I'd better go home.
And then what?
I'm staying here while you're going to jail?
- What do you want?
- Leave tonight.
I must have $200 left.
How much do you have at home?
I don't know.
And my mom's $500 or $600, I don't know where.
All right, let's go over there.
If there's no cops in front, we'll go in and take the money and we'll fold our bags, okay?
To do what?
What fucking planet do you live on?
What about this baby, it's mine?
How dare you?
Well, honey, I love you.
I swear to God, it's your baby.
But we have to get out of town, go west, or you'll go to jail... and my father will kill me.
He'll wait until I give birth.
Do you know who I am?
Damn it!
Libby.
I knew you'd find me one day.
You smart little one.
Don't move.
It's unexpected.
Why are you looking for me now?
Did Ben talk to you?
No, that's right.
You think knowing the truth will bring you serenity.
Like it's gonna fix your problems?
I was with Ben that night.
We were gonna leave town.
He went to his house to get money.
It happened an hour, two hours...
I thought he was down.
I fell asleep crying.
The next morning, I heard about the murders.
I packed my bags, I wrote to my father that I was no longer his little girl, and I ran away for good.
Ben never gave my name to the police.
All these years.
He protected me.
So he's the only one who knows what happened.
In my opinion, you'll find the serenity you're looking for if you make a reason.
I have to say, whatever the truth and even if I loved Ben... his place was in prison.
He had something in him that made him unfit for the outside world.
You were pregnant.
What happened to the baby?
I'm here.
I told you to wait in the car.
I know, but...
- I hear voices.
- Don't make any noise.
- I don't want to be alone.
- I know.
It's the drugs, it's going to pass.
I like your place.
Don't make any noise.
What's the matter?
Someone came here.
Who?
Not the cops, though?
I don't know.
I had a present for the baby.
- A present for me?
- He's gone.
What's that?
Libby's gonna find Mom.
There's less than I thought.
All the time, it's Michelle.
She's the one who stole my present, the filthy little snoop.
Something's wrong.
I heard everything!
Come here!
Let me through!
Shut up, bitch!
Stop it, it's okay.
Ben, let go of me!
Come here!
Diondra, damn it, leave her alone.
You're gonna wake everyone up!
You want me to let her ruin my life?
Drop it, stop it!
Listen to me.
We'll talk to her, she'll understand.
It's all right.
We weren't supposed to meet.
I'm a secret.
A child of love, hidden.
That's right, darling.
Crystal knows the whole story.
I'm telling him everything.
She's my best friend.
I even read your book.
I have an album of photos of all of you.
Magazine clippings.
Like a fake family album.
Can I call you tata?
I know, it must be a shock to you.
A drink?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Upstairs.
I've got the end of the story.
What do you mean?
Do you remember the killer we call the Indebted Angel?
They got him.
We got him.
One of our members pretended to be a bankrupt financier, and this Calvin Diehl offered to kill him.
He's a former farmer ruined by the grain embargo.
So what?
Since the 1980s, he has been making up suicides in murder.
What are you talking about?
Your mother hired him.
Are you sure?
Say, Lyle, can you come get me?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I need a second.
I'm sorry, but I really want to.
I'll be out in a second!
I'm coming.
You okay?
Yeah, all right.
I'll wait outside, they'll pick me up.
You have to keep the secret.
I can't take the risk of anyone believing I'm an accomplice, you know?
Why would we believe it?
Were you there that night?
Relax, it'll all be over in 30 seconds.
Tell Mom...
Get the fuck off her!
Damn it!
Mom, they're hurting Michelle!
Run!
Run!
No, I beg you.
Why are you forcing me to do this?
It wasn't planned.
Leave her alone.
I saw the cross was gone, I panicked.
It's okay.
Go get the gun in the buffet.
I can't find him.
In the box, on the left.
- I don't see him.
- Look carefully!
I'm looking!
What did you do?
- I'll call the police.
- Wait.
She wasn't closing her mouth.
It's her fault, she wasn't closing it.
Where's the girl?
Shit.
I'm sure he's in there!
Stop yelling at me!
It's a mess in there!
That's it, I got it.
Where are the bullets?
It's loaded, it's okay.
Mom.
Let me do it.
Damn it!
Are you passing?
- She's gone.
- The gun.
If she saw us, it's shit.
Well, honey.
It's no coincidence.
We want money, we do the ritual and your family is killed.
You're completely unlocking!
You're gonna get life insurance.
You want to go to California, live by the sea?
We can do it together.
If you want, I'll settle his account.
No, I'm going.
We'll never find her.
She could be anywhere.
She's probably not far away.
His friend's gonna be here any minute.
What if they called the cops?
We have to go!
If they find us...
Libby?
Stay where you are, sweetheart.
I love you, Libby.
I love you, honey.
Don't ever forget it.
What happened?
Where are they?
The house is empty.
It's over.
It's all right.
Diondra Wertzner, alias Polly Palm, was arrested last night in Texas.
This is the conclusion of a 1985 case, the massacre of the Kansas Prairies.
She is suspected of the murder of Michelle Day, for which her brother, Ben Day, spent 28 years in prison.
Miss Wertzner denies the facts.
But this morning we announced Ben Day's imminent release.
Their daughter Crystal is still running.
This is the last twist in the case of the serial killer Calvin Diehl, nicknamed the Angel of the Indebted, who killed or, according to him, "helped to die in dignity"
About 50 people since the 1980s.
Each of his victims had to sign a "permission to kill" and a farewell letter to his relatives.
"Dear Ben, Michelle, Libby and Debby,
I doubt this letter will find you, but Mr. Diehl promised to keep it.
It comforts me a little.
Your grandparents told me to lead a useful life.
I don't think I've been able to do that, but I can make my death useful.
My life has often been dictated by accidents.
I like the idea that a deliberate accident can fix everything today.
I hope you forgive me.
Take care of yourself.
I know you can count on Diane.
I wish I'd seen the amazing adults you'd become.
But I don't need it.
I have every confidence in my children."
Diondra was sure you'd find her.
She saw it right.
You met my daughter.
I had different echoes.
Is she as bad as Diondra?
I don't know.
How can I grow up with a murderous mother?
She won't be hiding long, I could find her.
She's not going to jail because of me.
Would you pass the sponge?
Want to do it right and screw up sadly, I know.
Are you talking about me or Mom?
I'm talking about myself.
It applies to all of us.
I've been silent for 28 years and I've been cashing in.
28 years protecting a girl I don't know.
By leaving her with your sister's killer.
Rightly or wrongly, I took on my choices.
I had to take care of them, too.
I wish I could say a magic formula to fix everything.
There's nothing left to say.
You lied.
I lied.
We're even.
What about the two of us?
You don't know me, Ben.
You think you do, but that's not true.
I don't know you either.
No mom, no Debby, no Michelle.
My meagre memories died with them that night.
If you knew what I'm mad at you...
But you're still my brother.
We're the same blood.
I won't let these events govern my life anymore.
I want to live normally.
I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon, Libby.
- The horse you were talking about, Yellow...
I don't understand.
Why "Yellow"?
I don't know.
Mom baptized him.
He wasn't even blond.
She took that secret with her.
I've got a lot of other stories.
Nice stories.
We had good times, you know.
I didn't get back on the highway.
I drove slowly to our farm.
She was still there.
This place is unhealthy.
That black hole where my mother invited death out of despair.
Ben was right.
There had been good times.
Ben learned in his prison what I didn't learn in mine.
I'm sorry.
Mom told us to live a useful life.
Nothing pretentious.
Nothing extraordinary.
A beginning.
I mean, a beginning.
