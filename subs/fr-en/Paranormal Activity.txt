Hey, honey, are you okay?
- What's that?
- Hey, honey.
Is that what I think it is?
I don't know what you're thinking, but whatever it is, it's great.
I think it's a huge camera.
What about the small portables?
Easy to transport and manageable?
Get the car, instead of standing there looking at me.
She's... she's huge and impressive.
And there's a dazzling light on it.
- Kiss the camera.
- No way.
How much did it cost you?
I'll kiss you, not the camera.
Turn that thing off...
- What are you doing?
- See?
You think this is gonna work?
I think it's going to be very interesting to film the paranormal phenomena that might take place.
Seriously, how much did you pay for this?
About half of what I won today.
Good thing you're cute.
What are we eating?
- Keep going.
- Oh, my God.
- All right, I'll make dinner.
- Great.
No.
So you can remember it in our old days?
Let's hope that once we've filmed something, we'll better understand what's going on.
And once we understand what's going on, we'll be able to react in office.
We'll improvise after that.
We'll take care of her case.
If he's a neighbor, a kid obsessed with you spying out the window at night, that's who should cool them down.
Unless that kid's been following me since I was eight...
- It's creepy.
...I don't think that's it.
Who are you telling?
- I realize you're...
- You okay?
Are you okay?
- You're talking to the...
- Are you all right?
Do you have enough battery?
You're supposed to be in love with me, not the machine.
We're gonna sleep with that camera.
- What?
- We'll put her in the bedroom.
All night?
You're cute.
You've been shy.
You turned your eyes away.
We're eating.
- Audio test.
- It's the last test, I hope.
Can you talk, please?
Hey, Micah.
You're the best boyfriend in the world,
- aside from your strange fascination...
- The video's working.
...for electronics.
- Katie, say something.
- What do you want me to say?
- Speak very slowly.
What do you want me to say?
- Murmure.
- I'm whispering.
- Can you hear me?
- Murmure.
- I'm whispering.
- You're not whispering.
Now I'm whispering.
That's a murmur, I think we filmed it.
Great, this microphone is worth it.
All right, everything's operational.
Great!
Do you know anything about these events?
I don't want to provoke anything...
I'd rather nothing happened.
I don't want to force any events.
If we're filming something, great, but I'm not gonna...
I'm saying that, because filming something would be great for a few reasons.
- Let's just say...
- I know.
...that would prove your theories.
- You believe me, don't you?
Of course.
What's this?
Let's investigate.
We hear a strange noise.
Do you hear that?
Is that the fridge?
It's the ice machine.
Goddamn it!
He won't get out until we get some sleep.
I would like to take this moment to illustrate the beauty of this superb instrument.
I was talking about her.
That's just my guitar.
You're nice.
- What are you doing?
- I like your feet.
They're sexy.
I have to recover from the varnish.
You shouldn't be filming my feet.
Do something sexual.
Can I have a stripper?
Please?
Just a half.
Bra and panties.
Come on, I'll do anything you want.
Anything.
Yeah, Venus.
Re-do Venus' pose.
So where are you going to put it?
There's the bathroom or the hallway.
We've got to get her to the hallway, and that's where we heard the steps.
It's dark.
Don't you see me?
- Not at all.
- What if I turn this on?
Yeah, that's better.
- Is it okay?
Need more light?
- No, I think it's okay.
- All right.
- Come check it out.
You weren't supposed to bring the camera here.
- We could...
- You're gonna get tired.
Be careful.
You're gonna get in the shower.
We could make a little intimate video.
I've already told you about it.
Yeah, we could, but no.
Nice try.
Know that my heart is suffering.
I'll do it again.
Okay, I'll connect the FireWire.
There you go.
- Is it working?
- Well?
I think it's okay.
Oh, my God.
How am I supposed to sleep with that?
It's okay.
She's looking at me.
That's what Katie looks like in the morning.
She's so pretty.
- What do you want for breakfast?
- It doesn't matter.
But...
"Whatever," that's not an answer.
Is there any scrambled eggs?
- All right.
- Perfect.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
Did you drop my keys?
Wait.
My keys are on the floor, right in the middle.
Look where I found my keys.
- Where did you leave them?
- On the counter.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I always leave them in the same place, next to your wallet.
This is irrefutable proof that evil forces have come from beyond to move your keys.
Make your own breakfast.
Nice splash.
- What are you doing?
- I'm filming you.
How mature.
I think it's my...
I've got a big one!
That's the quality I like best about you, your maturity.
Great day.
Today, the psychic is coming.
He'll be here in an hour.
We're gonna go see Micah and ask him what he thinks.
What do I think?
He's very excited.
Tell me what it feels like to meet our psychic?
- He'll be here in an hour.
- Is a doctor coming?
Great.
I'm so excited!
What an explosion of joy.
Get out of here.
Don't be shy.
I got something perfect for your psychic.
- What?
- I ran into it by chance.
Let me see.
I'll play it when he gets here.
It'll make him more comfortable.
You don't take this seriously, do you?
Don't you want to make him feel comfortable in his own environment?
Like this...
It's not going to make him feel comfortable, it's going to make him want to leave.
We're not gonna insult him...
You, not me.
Take off that happy smile.
Less music?
That was good.
The psychic's gonna give me some scholarship advice, too?
I haven't played a game in a while.
- Maybe if you're wise.
- An opinion on the challenger of the century?
- Or on the stock market?
- You're getting me drunk.
You might think a psychic would be punctual.
He should be able to predict traffic jams, right?
Very clever.
Wait, my music.
You don't have to.
Hello, Dr. Fredrichs?
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Come in.
This is Micah.
Sorry about the camera.
Can you plan anything?
- Are you planning traffic jams?
- Cut.
Depends on the day of the week, or the hour.
- See?
- Like all of us.
I never hesitate when I'm told, "Can you come to San Diego?"
I'm always ready to do it.
I'm glad you're here.
Thank you very much.
I'd like to get to know you a little bit more than you said on the phone.
I want to know more about your life, your relationship...
She's good.
- Is she okay?
A good thing.
- Very direct.
How long have you been together?
Three years.
We have to get engaged when she's finished her studies.
- And you work?
- I'm a student.
I'm studying English. I hope to teach.
I don't know where yet.
Micah is day trader.
What about your health?
- We're healthy.
- No medication?
Most often, the things you've told me have simple explanations, such as gnashing pipes, or other normal things that happen and make people panic, because of their level of stress.
So this...
Let's just say that you were haunted, it happened before you moved into this house.
Yes.
It started when I was eight.
I was living with my family, of course, and I was sharing a room with my little sister, Christi, who was five years old.
At the time, we both saw something.
I felt a breath, and it woke me up, and I woke her up.
And I saw the...
That mass... that shadow, at the foot of my bed.
Always at the foot of my bed, never at the foot of his.
- But she saw her.
- She saw her, too?
Absolutely.
We were terrified.
We couldn't move.
I mean, it was...
It was horrible.
Then we were praying that the shadows would go away.
And she ended up leaving.
It happened a while in our first house.
And then... there was a fire.
It's been...
Everyone got out of it safe and sound, thank God.
But we lost everything.
So we're gone.
Has the cause of the fire been determined?
I don't mean to say it was related to the shadow.
Not at all.
I don't know what it was.
Firefighters conducted an investigation to determine the cause?
I don't know if there was a criminal investigation, but I know they tried to find the cause, in vain.
It wasn't electric, it wasn't that simple.
So from the age of eight to now, the same thing happened to you periodically?
Yes.
Since I was 13, it's happened to me periodically.
In the last few weeks, it's been happening again.
So in fact, it followed you from where you lived at the age of eight, to where you lived at the age of 13, and now so far.
It's something that's related to you.
These lights sometimes flicker on the ceiling.
The faucets opened themselves without explanation.
Or sometimes we go down, and without doing anything, the faucet is turned on.
We heard blows to the walls, scratches, as if someone was scratching along the wall.
Most of the activity takes place here?
Yes, the majority.
I heard murmuring.
Sometimes I don't understand, sometimes it says my name.
Does that say your name specifically?
- It happened.
- Did you hear that, too, Micah?
I heard some weird noises.
I didn't hear anyone say Katie's name, except me.
Maybe it was me in my sleep.
There's a difference between you saying "Katie" in bed there, and something here that murmurs it distinctly in my ear.
I have a FireWire plugged into my laptop, we can record all night...
We have the foot, the big corner to film the whole room, an EVP recorder, which perceives any sound.
So you sleep with the light, and the camera turns when you go to bed.
- You do this all the time?
- We just bought the camera.
The second bathroom is here.
The guest rooms.
The lights are flickering.
What can be done to provoke these events?
- So you can film them?
- I told him I didn't want to provoke anything.
I didn't want him to buy the camera.
These ghosts smell negative energies.
If something negative happens, it'll make the ghost manifest.
The entity is only stimulated.
Don't let your mother come any more.
She's really mean.
Stop joking, Micah.
My domain is ghosts.
I built my career on this. I help people get in touch with people who are dead.
To communicate with ghosts.
The spirits of dead human beings.
A demon is something else.
It's an entity linked to something inhuman.
There are many debates about the nature of this something, but it is not a person.
Demons are not my domain.
It makes me very uncomfortable, and quite frankly, I feel something strange in this house.
You can't run away from this thing.
She'll follow you.
She can sleep for years.
Something must have woken her up, made her more active, and she'll eventually try to communicate with you.
I'll give you a name, Dr. Johann Averies.
He's a colleague.
He specializes in these things.
He's in Los Angeles.
And why don't we use an ouija, for example?
We find out what he wants, we give him what he wants, then... he disappears.
What he wants is probably Katie.
If you try to play with an ouija, the entity will feel that you are trying to communicate with it, and it's like opening the door to him, inviting him.
- Are you following me?
- Yes.
I hope so.
You're gonna be okay, okay?
Good to hear you say it.
Thanks for coming.
I'll call Dr. Averies.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
Goodbye.
Hello.
What an idiot!
You could have tried to be less rude to him.
They gave us good information, I'm not crazy.
At least we're doing something.
I'll call that guy tomorrow.
What guy?
- Dr. Johann Averies?
- The demonologist?
- Don't laugh at me.
- No.
Don't call that guy.
This is crazy.
- He said to call him tomorrow.
- Honey, don't call her.
Promise me you won't call him.
- You want my promise?
- I've already spoken to this guy, I won't stand a bunch of... fanatics of Jesus.
- If it gets worse, I'll call him.
- All right.
Your voice is so beautiful when you brush your teeth.
You want to have a little fun in front of the camera?
Not in front of the camera, no.
All right, let's turn off the camera for ten minutes.
Ten minutes, huh?
That's all I need.
For you, I don't know.
Let's go to bed.
Turn it off.
All right.
I'm going to settle in the room.
- Turn it off!
- Katie's in the bathroom.
- Turn it off.
- Hi, Katie.
I want to pee!
Turn it off.
Dr. Johann.
I'm Dr. Johann.
- I'll pee.
- I'm a demonologist.
Go away.
I can't hear you.
I'm here to save you from demons.
Come to bed.
All right!
Let me turn it off...
Are we having fun?
Wait!
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Camera's not off.
- Yes.
It's the stand-by light.
Not at all.
It's the clairvoyant when it's filming.
- Don't lie to me.
- All right.
What we've done is probably illegal in Kentucky and 12 other states.
This girl is a sex beast.
What time do you get up?
I don't know, about six o'clock.
NIGHT N° 3 20 SEPTEMBER 2006 Did you wake up?
Sleeping well?
Is that the video?
I was watching last night's footage.
Look.
It's about 2:10 in the morning.
- The door.
- Wait a minute.
Did you see that?
The doors and windows of the entire house are closed.
I just checked.
The flowers don't move.
But something else is moving.
- The door's moving on its own.
- Oh, my God.
That's not all.
Look.
She's moving again.
- Micah, it's...
- That's impossible.
I told you it was a good idea.
You think you can get that ghost back?
- What?
- Bring the ghost back.
Filming other interesting things...
No, I just want him to leave me in peace.
Micah!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Come here right now!
What?
There!
Grab her!
Get rid of it, please.
Are you yelling like that for a simple spider?
You went to take the camera first?
I thought it was a ghost, something really scary...
I'm losing my mind and you're gonna get the camera.
And small!
What's your name?
Can I turn off the camera?
I need some air.
- All right, let's go.
- Out.
Are you here?
What was all this about?
You wanted to move the door?
Or are you just doing some arbitrary stuff?
Basically, it could be two things:
It could be a ghost or a demon.
Dr. Fredrichs said it wasn't a ghost.
- And whatever it is...
- According to the evidence...
I'll do some research and find out what it is.
I don't know what's following me, but I don't have the feeling... that it's human.
He'd rather be a monster.
He wants to hurt me.
It's more like a demon, then.
- That's what he said.
- Ghosts are human spirits.
Yes.
And this thing is not human.
Maybe you're right, which is bad, because demons suck!
Basically, they are evil and evil spirits that exist only to cause pain and harm for fun.
It's creepy.
They harass people for years, decades.
They are sometimes very intelligent in their ways of fearing.
It could be a very rare phenomenon, it's cool to film it.
Surprisingly, I'm not as excited as you, considering I'm the one who's haunted.
It's okay.
We'll take care of it.
I understand this is all new to you, and very exciting, and I know you want to film it all.
But it's not new to me, and I think this thing is dangerous.
I want you to know that if things... evolve or get worse, I don't want to use the camera anymore.
I don't want to piss him off.
I understand you, but remember you didn't tell me about this.
- before we move in together.
- I know.
So I have a say in what we're doing.
Yeah, but seriously, what was I supposed to say?
On the first date: "There's a demon following me..."
No, but maybe on our 15th or 30th date, or when we decided to live together, you could have talked about it.
Here.
The windows are closed, the doors are closed, the alarm is on.
If anything comes in, we'll know.
This thing makes a lot of fun of alarms and closed doors.
She goes wherever she wants, she does what she wants.
How do you know?
Whatever happens, she's already here.
All right.
What's the matter?
What's going on?
I had a nightmare.
Sorry, did I scare you?
It's nothing.
- Oh, my God.
- You okay?
Are you sure?
My head.
Did you hear that?
- I'm going down.
- No, Micah!
Micah, don't leave me here alone.
Take this.
Where do you think it came from?
Hello?
- That's it?
- Micah, stop!
Don't do that.
Come on.
You okay?
Yes.
- Are you sure?
- I'm a little freaked out.
- Hey, girls.
- No, but you know what?
- If you could show me...
- Excuse me!
I know, it's afternoon necklaces, but I need to show you something.
Can it wait?
We're having an intense time with girls right now, and we can't be interrupted by Micah and his camera.
- Thank you, I get it.
- I need to take a break...
Goddamn it!
I'm trying to show you something.
Be nice.
That's the tape from the digital audio recorder I installed in the room.
It was recorded ten seconds before we woke up.
What was that?
I've listened to him 50 times.
It doesn't say anything.
It's not a recognizable language, it's not a dog. It's not a noise in the street or an electrical interference that I recognize...
- Oh, my God!
- So I'm concluding...
The thing is in the room.
This thing wants to communicate.
So I'm gonna go get the ouija.
I don't want to know what this thing means to me.
- I want her to leave us alone.
- Trust me.
Bad idea.
He said, "Don't do anything that can upset or..."
- It doesn't matter what it is.
- I shouldn't have told you.
You're gonna use an ouija to invite her,
- and she'll never leave.
- Let me do it.
You love your camera.
If you buy an ouija, it's over.
Promise me, Micah!
All right.
I promise I won't buy ouija.
Hey, Micah, smile.
Nothing interesting has happened in a while!
Are you scared?
What's the matter with you?
Put the camera away, let's go to bed.
- Go to sleep.
- Come on.
- Don't be upset...
- Come on!
I'll call you!
That's enough, Micah!
Stop!
Your demon sucks.
You suck!
You have nothing in your stomach.
Put the camera away.
What's the matter?
I thought I heard something.
What?
A deaf noise.
- Where?
- Downstairs, maybe.
Shit.
Where are you going?
Oh, my God.
Wait.
Micah, wait, please.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Here.
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?
Oh, my God.
You okay?
Oh, my God.
It's over now.
Come on, come on.
We have video evidence of that noise.
Do you hear that?
Wait.
Do you hear that?
Yes.
I don't know what it is.
That's great, Katie.
I'm telling you.
It's...
I hope this thing... this thing will show us something else.
- That's hell.
- You think it's smart to play with that?
You don't take this seriously, and it scares me.
I'm taking this very seriously.
I think that's...
You're filming me in the bathroom.
You look great in the morning, by the way.
We shouldn't have a camera.
Oh, come on, these pictures are hell.
It's essential, with all the cool stuff that's going on.
- Cool?
- Or disturbing.
- Aren't you afraid?
- It's... it's a little weird.
But everything's documented.
It looked like sounds coming out of the wall or the ceiling.
- Or ground.
- You think so?
Yeah, I don't know what it was...
Like someone dropped something very big and heavy.
Like someone lifts the couch, for example?
All this wasn't happening before the camera.
- Before what?
- Before the camera.
- It has nothing to do with it.
- It's getting worse.
It wasn't that bad.
It was just a little loud.
He was the scared child in me.
It's okay, thanks.
TEU experience number one.
Hello?
Where did you come from?
Do you have anything to say?
In our language this time?
Would you rather talk to Ouija?
What are you looking for?
What's your favorite color?
Where did you come from?
Do you have anything to say?
In our language this time?
He doesn't have anything to say, does he?
Would you rather talk to the Ouija?
What the hell is that?
You're the one who grunts right now?
Like, once for "yes," twice for "no"?
Yeah.
Nice.
Let's watch a movie.
I don't want to sleep right now.
- Why?
- I'm scared.
Come on, turn off the camera.
Katie.
Are you downstairs?
Shit.
Katie?
Honey?
What are you doing here?
What?
It's freezing here.
What are you doing without clothes?
- It's okay.
- Come on.
I don't want to go home.
Leave me alone.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Come on.
You want to sit on the swing in the middle of the night,
- while it's freezing?
Go away.
I'm gonna stay here with you.
I'll get some blankets.
What the hell is going on?
It's ridiculous to sit outside.
What was that?
Who's there?
Katie, go home!
What's going on?
Come on!
Shit!
- What are you doing?
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?
I just heard noises, I came to get blankets,
- because you were on the swing...
...for a reason I don't know.
And then I hear it tripping here.
You woke me up.
- And the TV's on.
I don't know what's going on anymore.
- I'm cold.
- Why are you going crazy?
You don't remember any of this?
No, I mean...
Don't you remember getting up?
Don't you remember you standing there, all weird?
I'm just saying that...
- Oh, my God.
- What about this?
You don't...
Are you sleepwalking?
- What happened to your head?
- I don't know!
Oh, my God.
What do you remember?
- Were you dreaming?
- I don't remember anything.
I remember I was at the door and you were filming me.
You were freaked out.
I don't remember getting up.
You went down, you sat on the swing.
I went to get you a blanket, you didn't want to go home.
Go ahead until I get down.
I'm leaving the room, but where...
You went down, you sat on the swing.
I went to get you a blanket, because you wouldn't get out of this catatonic and weird state.
- I don't know...
- Wait.
Did I talk to you?
I wouldn't say that.
When I got up, I heard steps, and the TV was on.
It's...
Maybe this kind of thing has been happening for a long time, but you didn't know.
I don't remember anything.
I know I've had nightmares all night and...
What?
I didn't want to talk about it.
Let's just say they were horrible.
He's trying to scare us.
He just wants to...
- It's working!
I'm scared!
- We have to stay strong.
We mustn't let you be disassembled, let us be disassembled.
Bringing a stranger, an exorcist, for example, often makes things worse, and we don't want it to get worse.
- No, I didn't.
- No, neither do I.
All right, son of a bitch.
All right, son of a bitch.
Do you have anything to say?
This is your chance.
- Katie!
Where are you?
Wait.
I can't wait to leave this house, go out and spend time with my boyfriend.
Okay, we got ten minutes.
What the hell are you doing, Micah?
- Help me.
- What are you doing?
- I'll talk to him.
I told you I was gonna...
You promised me you wouldn't...
Don't look at me like that.
You promised me you wouldn't touch that.
No, I promised you I wouldn't buy ouija.
I didn't buy one.
You knew what I meant!
I borrowed an Ouija.
How dare you?
You knew very well what I meant.
I told you not to play with that, it scares me, and what are you doing?
You find the most beautiful ouija I've ever seen, and you put it in the middle of the living room?
Explain that to me!
- I borrowed it.
- I don't care.
You're gonna throw it away.
We're leaving.
- Katie...
- No more cameras, nothing.
I don't want to know anything.
I don't want to hear anything.
Don't talk to me.
I'm leaving, and you can come with me or not.
Calm down!
I don't want to hear anything.
I'm gonna take off my shoes and go to bed...
What?
What did you do, Micah?
Look at me!
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
You're amazing, Micah.
It's over.
No more cameras.
I'll take care of it.
If you don't want to do it, I'll do it.
Someone drew something on it.
I don't know.
Katie?
What?
Can you come downstairs to help me understand that?
Excuse me?
The thing left a message, I think.
On the ouija.
I don't care what Ouija says!
Katie!
Listen...
Micah, get out of here!
- I don't want to watch this!
- It's not a good time.
- Get out!
Out!
She's in trouble.
It's bad.
- I know you're upset, but...
- Do we have lemon?
What do I have to do?
Tell me.
You have to turn that camera off.
The camera...
Forget the camera.
I swear to abide by Katie's rules of camera use, and her other rules.
Is that okay with you?
A little more sincerity.
I swear to abide by Katie's camera usage rules, and not offend this entity, no matter what it is, in any way, I swear.
And I promise I won't betray Katie's trust.
- Anything else?
- That'll be all.
All right.
Shit.
Can I have a kiss, at least?
Good night.
You want to know what happened to Ouija?
I saw the tape.
I want to forget all this.
Let's sleep.
I think I found something pretty cool, and I want you to help me understand it.
Then sit down.
Or stay up.
I filmed everything that happened after we left.
The cursor moved on its own.
I'm trying to decrypt what he said.
I couldn't decode everything, but there's a lot of possibilities.
Do you know anyone named Edina or Diane?
No, there aren't two Ns.
I'll figure it out.
Maybe it's...
Maybe the thing is looking for us and it doesn't mean anything.
Or... there's so many possibilities, maybe I'm wrong.
I don't know.
I don't care what that means.
You're done playing with this.
I don't want that in the house.
There wasn't a week without something going on.
- This is crazy.
- I can't...
- What are you talking about?
- Everything.
- Come and sleep at my place.
- It's not the house.
It's me.
Wherever I go, the thing will follow me.
I'm not going to come to your house and get you into trouble.
- I have a plan, don't worry.
- Micah, what's your plan?
- I have a plan.
- What are you gonna do?
- You know what...
- Don't worry.
- There you go.
- All right, here's the deal.
What?
You can have your powder, do your little experiments.
If it doesn't work, if it doesn't help us, I'll call the demonologist to take care of it.
- All right.
- Look at me, not the camera.
All right, deal.
Satisfied?
- All right.
- All right.
Is it on?
Yes.
And what's this gonna prove?
If anything goes through here, it'll leave a trace.
We've already established that there was a real presence.
So tomorrow, I'll call the demonologist.
Put your powder on.
You'll clean up tomorrow.
Take a breath, take a sedative, it'll be okay.
- Excuse me?
- We'll find out what's going on.
- Then we can go crazy.
- A sedative?
Is that how it is?
Our floor is covered with powder.
- I'll clean it up.
- All right.
What a beauty.
I did some research.
I'll take care of it.
I won't allow anyone to come to my house and fuck my girlfriend without paying the price.
What do you want to do?
- You want to call the demonologist?
- Exactly!
- An exorcist?
- I want to finish it.
You want to trust a charlatan?
This is my house, my girlfriend.
I'm the one who's gonna solve this problem.
Trust me.
It's over.
What?
The powder is the end.
NIGHT N° 17 4 OCTOBER 2006
Tomorrow, I'll call.
You're so cute, don't talk.
Did you hear that?
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
You know what?
There are signs of entry, but no exit.
Oh, my God!
- Don't leave me here.
- Turn on the light.
Let's get out of here, let's get out of here.
The thing is still there.
Come on!
She can't run away.
Where is she?
What?
The tracks stop here.
Micah, maybe it's a trap.
Come on.
Oh, my God!
Did you do that?
It's not you, is it?
Tell me you opened it.
Of course not.
What's this?
Don't go.
I forbid you to go.
I'm not gonna go, I'm just gonna...
- Look.
- No way!
I'll take a look.
I'll get the ladder.
It's all set up.
I don't want you going up there, I beg you.
I'm not going, I'm going to look.
You have no idea what's up there.
I know.
Give me the camera.
- Be careful.
- If something goes wrong, I'll give you the camera and I'll go down, okay?
Can you see anything?
I don't want to be here alone.
I'll be right back.
What's this?
There's something stuck over there.
Micah, get down!
Please!
Wait.
Here.
- What?
- Take the camera.
Come on.
- I'm holding the ladder.
- There's something up there. I need to see what.
Micah, be careful.
You okay?
Micah, answer me!
- It's okay.
- I...
Thank God.
I found this.
No.
Let me see.
- What are you talking about?
- It's from our old house.
What the hell is going on in the attic?
I thought this whole thing burned.
It's impossible for you to find this in our attic!
It's impossible for this thing to exist!
I haven't seen this picture in 15 years.
That doesn't make any sense.
You okay?
Can you turn off the light?
I'm sorry.
Where did you find her?
Over our bed.
I'm gonna go clean this up.
I don't know if I'm going to class today.
I'm tired.
Why are you filming me?
I'm just making coffee.
I'm sick of it.
We both need sleep.
I need a new life.
I'm sick of it.
- Look at this.
- What?
I cleared up last night's footage.
We see the tracks.
Oh, my God.
- So what?
- What?
What are you gonna do?
I don't know yet.
I do.
We'll call Dr. Averies.
We used your camera, put your powder on the floor, and things just got worse.
We should've called him two weeks ago.
We're gonna do it today.
Let's talk about it first.
I'm in control of the situation, we're moving on.
No, we're not progressing and you're not in control!
It's this thing that controls us.
If you think you can control him,
- You're a fool!
- Stay calm.
Nothing you did helped.
I'm sorry to break your illusions, but the camera didn't help, either.
You think this thing would leave traces against her will?
He left some because he wanted it.
He wanted you to find my picture.
It can be everywhere.
He hears what they're saying right now.
- How do you know?
- You're totally powerless!
That's not true at all, and you know it.
Get back on your feet.
I called Dr. Averies and he's not here.
I didn't know what to do, so I called Dr. Fredrichs.
I know you don't love her, but I do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He couldn't come before.
If we can survive until then, if we can stop...
- We're gonna survive until then!
- If we could just...
- "Survival," the big words!
- If we can hold on, it's okay.
- and maybe he can help us.
- This is fucking ridiculous!
Shit!
What happened?
What are you doing?
What did you hear?
There's something.
Shit!
Oh, my God!
Come here.
Don't...
Please stay here.
Don't go.
I'm gonna go check it out.
Wait, don't go.
No!
Don't open it.
Stop.
Come on.
Immediately.
Who's there?
- Stop it!
- Are you kidding us?
Micah, stop.
Come back.
Show yourself!
Come on, let's go.
We have to get out of here.
- Is there a problem?
- Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Stop!
He wants to scare us, huh?
- It won't change anything.
- I'm not going to this room.
- I'm not going to this room.
- Please...
- If he comes back...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Please.
It won't change anything.
- I can't...
- Come on.
I don't want to be here.
I want to sleep downstairs.
All right.
What's in there?
I don't know if it'll be better downstairs.
I don't want to be here.
We should go back up.
Come on.
You have to sleep well every once in a while.
I'm so scared.
I couldn't be in that room anymore.
I get it.
I can't stay in this house, Micah.
We can't even be home.
What's this?
I'll check the mirrors.
Our photo!
- What picture?
- This one, look!
Fuck...
Why is my face scratched and not yours?
There's something here.
- That's bullshit!
- It's here.
What's that?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
I can feel it.
I feel his breath on me.
Micah, come on!
Damn it!
- Get down.
- Oh, my God.
Come on.
Did it happen by day?
It's getting worse and worse.
Shit.
- Stop taking a hundred steps.
- I'm sorry.
- It makes me nervous.
- I'm nervous.
Come in.
Thank you so much for coming back.
We have to follow up.
We called Dr. Averies, but he left.
He's abroad.
He's coming back.
He's...
- We need your help.
- The thing takes power.
- It's getting worse.
- She doesn't like my presence here.
- I can't help you.
I have to get out of here.
My presence makes this thing angry.
Don't leave us alone.
Calm down, we need your help.
I'm not qualified to help you in this kind of situation.
It's not my field.
I think my presence is hurting you instead of helping you.
- I have to go.
Dr. Averies will be back in a few days.
When he comes back, he'll solve your problem.
What should we do?
Leave?
Leaving won't help you.
I'll see what I can do.
But I have to leave this room.
- It's not a joke.
- I'll help you.
But I can't do anything now.
Are you serious?
We'll take care of it ourselves.
Shit.
I'm sick of all this.
I know.
I don't want to live like this.
- Micah!
Wake up!
- What's the matter?
I just felt it breathing.
He was right there, I felt his breath.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Come back!
I'm not going anywhere.
Calm down, nothing's going on.
I'm telling you...
I'm not leaving you.
Don't you feel it?
I can feel it, he's still here.
Something's wrong.
Breathe loudly.
I feel like he's watching me.
Right now.
You're freaking me out.
- We have to do something.
I don't know.
We have to find a way.
We have to...
I'll find a way.
I'll do some research.
There must be other options.
- Oh, my God.
- It's so creepy.
I knew something happened last night.
Shit.
We have to do something.
I feel something's wrong.
I was doing some research to find solutions.
- I found this website.
That girl, Diane, one of the possibilities of ouija?
The same things happened to him in the '60s.
What do you mean, the same things?
Everything.
When she was eight years old, her house burned, she saw shadows.
She called an exorcist.
Is that her?
You mean there was a girl in the '60s that happened to me exactly the same thing.
Exactly.
Maybe it's the same demon.
He set his sights on you.
It's just his way of operating.
And he's trying to warn us, with this ouija, he wants us to find this woman so we know...
What happened to him?
Is she okay?
They tried to get rid of him, and sometimes he gets even more upset.
Before the exorcist arrived, she wasn't like that.
She heard voices and had nightmares.
I'm trying to figure out why this thing would choose you, after haunting her.
I can't find anything.
According to my readings, these things are arbitrary.
- There's nothing to understand.
- How did she die?
She's pretty.
I think this demon is trying to warn us not to look for drownings.
I don't want to take that risk.
Oh, my God!
It's not gonna happen to us.
He's already gone by himself.
It's not worth taking the risk.
I'm going to lie down.
I have an idea what we can do.
More stuff...
Get out of here with your camera.
I'm trying to revise.
I want to talk to you about this thing.
Please, five minutes.
Go away.
Calm down.
I'm trying to find a solution to the problem.
I have ideas I want to talk to you about.
The problem is you and your camera.
- But at last!
- Leave me alone.
Stop following me with the camera!
I'm doing what I can.
I'm not the one who brought this demon to our house.
- Very nice, to tell me that.
Thank you very much.
Go hang out upstairs with your buddy, and I'll stay downstairs.
- Shut up!
- That's right.
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't do anything wrong.
You didn't do anything wrong.
It's not your fault, can you hear me?
You didn't do anything wrong.
Let go of her!
Micah, do something!
I don't care, I just want to leave.
I can't be here anymore.
Let's go, please.
Let's go now.
Let's take the car and get out of here.
All right, let's go.
I'll find us a hotel.
We'll sleep there tonight, until we figure something out.
We're not staying here tonight.
I'd like to film the mark he made on your back.
May I?
Oh, my God!
- Looks like you got bit.
- I know.
Let's go.
You ready?
The car's loaded.
Let's go.
Drop it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wake up!
I'm sick of this shit!
Come on, come on.
Get up.
Come on.
To the couch.
I'm sick of this shit.
I'll put an end to it right now!
I'm done!
You ready?
We're leaving.
I loaded the car.
Let's go.
I don't want to leave.
What do you mean?
Let's get out of this house!
I don't want to leave.
Can you stay with me?
- What are you talking about?
- It'd be better if we stayed.
Please.
I don't want to leave.
Trust me.
You want to stay here and sleep in that bed, and get shot in the hallway?
I don't think so.
It's okay.
It'll be better if we stay.
You son of a...
I don't know what's going on, but it's crazy!
I think it's gonna be okay now.
What's the matter?
Oh, my God!
