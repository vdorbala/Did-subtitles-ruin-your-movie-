My favorite children's book is about a little prince who comes from a distant asteroid.
He meets a pilot whose plane crashed into the desert.
He teaches him many things, mainly about love.
My father told me I was his little prince.
After I met Adam, I realized I had always been the pilot.
- Hello, Adam.
- Hello, Kelli.
- Hello, Lulu.
- Hello, Adam.
- I don't know what to say.
- Anything.
Adam Raki is the cutest in the office.
You okay?
- All right.
- Hello, Adam.
Good morning, Mr. Klieber.
Hello, Kelli.
- Hello.
- Hello, Adam.
- How does she do it?
- What?
How does she know I talked before you?
Voice recognition.
I entered some employees' voice models and added SPLICE to the system.
SPLICE means a stereo linear compensation in a vector space.
- It's an algorithm that...
- Adam.
Is there a talking doll or a singing fish with SPLICE?
You allowed me to give him Kelli's voice.
But I didn't say to give him a will of his own.
She has no will of her own.
Five thousand to 100 dollars, not five to 1000 dollars, capisce?
- Goodbye, Mr. Klieber.
- Goodbye, Adam.
All this gives us the rare opportunity - to explore the border... - Exploring the border...
Ladies and gentlemen, the Actors Studio is proud to welcome an actress we admire,
Julia Roberts.
Perfect.
Is it open?
I mean, to the tenants.
Do you have the key?
Yes.
I just moved in.
Beth Buchwald.
- Adam.
Second floor, two.
You're not doing your laundry?
Yes.
Looks like it's urgent.
Could you open the door for me?
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.
I loved my neighborhood, but it's bigger here, and I'm a stone's throw from Wildwood.
You see the sky on the third floor?
I guess so, if the windows weren't that bad.
Calling a Wild Forest school in the middle of Manhattan?
It's temporary.
The job, not the name of the school.
I'm a child writer.
- What about you?
- I'm helping with the creation of toys.
Are you an elf?
No, electronic engineer.
We need a map for the machine.
No, I have one.
Very funny.
I forgot mine up there.
Can I borrow yours?
All right.
Thank you.
Good job, Beth.
Hey, neighbor.
There are new images of Saturn from the Cassini project.
Oh, my God.
I've always wanted to know more about space.
Really?
Know what's up there.
You need to target a little bit.
You're probably right.
I have telescopes, sky maps, books.
You can borrow them.
And we could go watch the sky tonight.
- Maybe.
One day.
- All right.
I'm gonna drag that big food bag to the top.
All right.
All right.
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching people.
Anyone in particular?
No, people.
I'm going out with friends tonight, if you want to come.
They're people, maybe you'll want to watch them.
Otherwise, it doesn't matter.
I want to come, but I don't think I can.
- Well, if you're busy...
It's not a date, it's just to celebrate my move-in.
When?
About 8:00.
There's no pressure.
I'll knock on your door when I get out, and if you can, all right.
- All right.
- Yes?
- Good.
Adam?
Adam!
- We're called.
- Good night!
Sorry I didn't date your friends.
No problem.
I've been overwhelmed.
I have something to show you.
Come in.
Well!
You said you wanted to know more about space.
People think he's still, but we know he's expanding.
Each part of the universe moves away from each other, often faster than the speed of light, except...
I thought there was nothing faster.
Nothing moves faster in space, but...
- You know what the Big Bang is?
- In the beginning, God...
- According to the theory of cosmic inflation, the Big Bang comes from a piece of space of 9 kg, 14 billion years ago, which expanded in 10 power minus 39 seconds.
Ten power minus 39 seconds?
Zero, comma, 39 zeros, then one.
Or the fraction of a second where the universe was formed.
It's billions of times faster than the light.
It's fast.
Yes.
It's images of stars and galaxies that have gone away from us for hundreds of millions or billions of years.
It's still close compared to the rest of the universe we'll never see.
Never?
The elements that separate at this speed cannot be seen, for the light of one never catches the light of the other.
After the Big Bang, expansion slowed down, but after seven billion years, it suddenly accelerated and has continued to increase since then.
One day, everything you see here will disappear forever.
The celestial vault will become totally black.
It's sad.
Sad?
I'm talking too much...
No, it's fascinating.
I can't wait to get over these things.
Really.
It's exciting.
I could talk to you about the theory, Mr. No, I'm fine.
Maybe another time.
It's very speculative.
I should go.
Good night, Beth.
Good night.
Thank you.
I love your planetarium.
You're welcome.
- I could have waited, Dad.
- Not another day.
You should've left five years ago.
- They were just mice.
- But I was right.
You like it.
It's not Greenwich Village.
- I only met one person.
He's got a planetarium in his living room.
- Did you get into his living room?
- He's cute.
- What about Rich Lippmann?
- Let's avoid the subject.
What was his company's name?
Founders Fund?
All right.
Is your neighbor an astronomer?
No, he says he's an electronic engineer.
He hasn't even greeted me the other time...
- He's an idiot.
- No, it's me.
Didn't anyone tell you that single children are spoiled, emotionally retarded and too confident?
What were you thinking?
We had a perfect child.
- What about school?
- It's just started.
"Lessons of civilization are a race between disaster and education."
- John F. Kennedy.
- I know.
By marrying a banker, you'll do whatever you want.
Rich Lippmann is a jerk.
Can we just leave this alone?
Don't talk like that.
No one's perfect.
That's all I'm saying.
...the sensors detected an error in space analysis...
Adam, I'm having lunch.
- Speak English.
- I'm sorry.
See, the Star Tracker is...
Stop with your natural radioactivity, your black holes and robots on Mars.
Lunch break is for chatting.
We can talk about women, time, etc. Got it?
- But the Star Tracker...
- No.
A woman moved into the 3-A.
Here we go.
And?
That's all.
Wait. "A woman moved into the 3-A.
She looks..."
- She looks nice.
- Good!
Good.
- You're gonna get to know him?
- It's done.
- We did our laundry.
She came to my house.
- Really?
- Yeah, I told him about space.
Oh, my God.
And?
- He liked it.
- This...
Scary.
Are you going to see her again?
I see her almost every day.
Did you talk to him again?
No.
Adam, you're the man.
You have to start talking.
- Why don't you give her dinner?
- I can't.
That idiot closed his car and left the key in it, and he thinks he can insult me.
He must have calmed down now.
Harlan...
Go on like this, kid.
Are you and Mom still going to Barbados this year?
- It's still in talks.
- Really?
There's a little problem to solve.
- Between you and Mom?
- No.
In the company.
There was an indictment last March.
Company?
No, I've been charged.
It's nothing.
A young F.B.I. who plays Clarence Darrow.
We've got the date of the trial on January 19th.
- A trial?
We had to organize everything first.
But this bullshit, excuse my language, took over me, so the holidays are on hold.
- Dad!
- Don't worry.
But if you write the next Harry Potter, it can be used to pay for those lawyers' gonifs.
- Friday night for dinner?
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you!
Beth?
Beth?
Adam!
I'm sorry, I don't really want company tonight.
All right.
Come with me.
I'll show you something.
Beth?
- The park's closed.
- We're almost there.
- I want to go home!
I don't...
- Right here.
Adam, I...
Raccoon in Central Park?
That's great.
What are they doing here?
They feed.
- How did you know they'd be here?
I often come to observe them.
It's quiet.
They're not really in their place, but they're there.
They'll be back soon.
You want to wait?
Of course.
Mr. Klieber.
It's okay.
I scared you.
Yes.
I wanted to tell you that you did a great job - for a year and a half.
- Good.
When your father explained to me...
When he explained your stuff, I had doubts, but he was right.
A man of your size and salary has been of great value here.
- Good.
- But the world is changing.
You can't be the local confectionery anymore.
- We have to compete.
- Confectionery?
Five thousand to 100, not five to 1,000.
I have to let you go.
But I'm going to make you an incredible letter of recommendation.
- Let me go?
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't want to leave.
I'm not done.
I... I made an offer.
It's decided.
- Did you find it better?
- No better.
Cheaper.
Go home.
Talk to your father about it.
He'll find another job...
- ...nothing.
Kelli has the termination of the contract.
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye, Adam.
Goodbye, Mr. Klieber.
I'm sorry, Adam.
Don't think about it.
You're gonna find something.
I'm so sorry.
See you soon?
Sir, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I'm looking at the kids.
Show me your ID.
I was watching the kids.
Please turn around, hands against grilling.
- Why are you doing this?
- Bend your hands on the grill.
Turn around!
Hands on the grill.
- What are you doing?
I'll take your wallet to check your identity.
- Adam, 15, Central K, for an identity check. "Adam Raki."
- Is that the man you denounced?
- It wasn't me.
Stay where you are.
Do you live or work around here?
Get in the car.
- Beth!
- You're the one who turned him in?
Adam!
What's going on?
- You know this man?
- He's my neighbor.
What's the matter?
Adam Raki, no record.
- Nothing to report.
- All right, excuse us.
You're never too careful with the kids.
You can leave.
Adam!
Adam?
That's enough gifts, all right?
It's awful what they did, isn't it?
You stopped to look at the kids.
- I'm afraid of the police, too.
All right.
- You live alone?
- Yes.
It's big for one person.
For the city.
- My father lived here, too.
- Where is he now?
- Queens.
- Queens.
He died six weeks ago.
I'm so sorry.
My friend Harlan says everyone ends up in Queens, because we don't see the difference anymore.
It's... terrible.
- It's a joke, according to Harlan.
- No, for your father.
- What about your mother?
- She died when I was eight.
I'm so sorry.
I had a good time last night in the park.
Were you excited?
- What?
- Sexually, in the park.
No, not really.
I was, and I wanted to know if you were, too.
Thank you so much for the glass of water.
- Because I talked to you.
- sexual excitement?
- No, I...
Well, yes.
Sometimes it's hard for me to...
I got this thing that keeps me from...
Asperger's syndrome.
It prevents me, among other things, from knowing what people think.
- Like now.
- All right.
I was wondering how you felt.
I don't feel anything.
It's just a fact.
All right.
My brain works differently than that of the N.T.
- N.T.?
- Neurotypicals.
I don't always understand them, especially when what they mean is different from what they say.
- You don't?
Most aspies are very sincere.
The shrinks see it as a lack of imagination, but most are neurotypical.
Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Mozart, they all had a lot of imagination.
- Aspergers?
- Probably.
Before, I would have just thought you were excited because I was.
It's "mental blindness."
I had to learn to ask people their thoughts.
I get it.
There's no harm.
I really have to go.
All right.
I'm so sorry about your father.
Can I see you again?
I live upstairs, so...
Great.
See you.
- You got a minute?
- Hey, Beth, come in.
Thank you.
Is that a bad sign when the description of a school bothers its principal?
What do you know about Asperger's syndrome?
A developmental disorder, a type of high-level autism.
How exactly does that translate?
The fan is wide.
It can be hard to detect.
These can be major social problems.
I should get more information, talk to the child, and we...
No.
He's my neighbor.
He's got it.
But he's really nice and quite interesting.
Sometimes they're very bright.
It's in the autistic spectrum.
I think I have a...
Autobiographical narrative.
Living with Asperger's syndrome.
No, it's not serious.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Beth, can you take a look, please?
Of course.
You're saying relationships aren't his strong suit, right?
- Not really.
- Well...
Thank you.
By paying your father's liabilities, debits, funeral expenses and expenses, the estate amounts to $25,000.
He bequeathed $5,000 to the Kids at Risk Music Foundation and $10,000 to you, Mr. Keyes.
So, as the primary beneficiary, Adam...
You inherit the rest, which comes from Juilliard's death benefit and the TIAA pension plan.
There is also about $300,000 of net equity related to the apartment.
If you sell, - after the fee is paid...
- Sell what?
You'll probably move to a smaller dwelling.
Move?
Without your father's income, repayment of the loan...
- I don't want to move.
- Calm down.
It's an opportunity.
You can change town...
Adam never left this town alone.
Stay close, then.
Your salary...
I don't have a job anymore, I've been fired.
I'm so sorry.
The net worth of the apartment
- It's a big change.
- I'm not selling.
- Adam.
- Mr. Raki...
- You're hurting my ears!
- I'm not selling my house.
I won't sell my house!
Bras against the chest.
Mr. Wardlow, are we done?
We need to sign the papers.
- Can you send them?
- They have to...
Yes.
We'll send them.
Come on, Adam, let's go.
I can't...
I can't move.
All right.
Let's go.
You're not 10 years old anymore.
You need a job.
I'm fired!
Do you know how many times I've been fired?
When your father and I came back from the army, I had a week of three days.
First day, I hated the job.
Day two, I hated the chief.
Third day, I hit someone, everything had to be done again.
I didn't hit anyone, never.
Adam, you're 29 years old and you can't pay off the jobless loan.
What are you gonna do?
Hello.
I just wanted to make sure you got home.
Are you home?
Beth?
I think I had to discover the beauty of our relationship.
You're not gonna ruin everything...
Adam?
Go home.
Wait...
What the hell were you doing outside?
You could have killed yourself!
How did you think you'd come down?
- Climbing.
- Climbing?
It's 1,360 kg long.
You said you didn't see anything through your windows.
- Why did you scream?
- I went home, and there was a funny guy in my window.
- It was me!
- But I didn't know!
I guess not.
Thank you for trying to...
You're welcome.
You want to...
Would you like some tea?
- Yes.
- Good.
Harlan told me to send letters of motivation and to worry later about the interviews.
Interviews?
They usually go wrong.
- Have you submitted applications?
- Eighty-seven.
Eighty-seven?
Unsolicited applications and responses to offers.
- You submitted 87 requests?
- Spontaneous applications included.
Today?
That's a lot.
I don't want to move.
Good.
This tea smells really good.
English tea.
My dad says it's a coffee without the bad breath.
I should go.
I'm sorry.
I...
Sorry, you...
I'm a little worried.
My father's an accountant, and he's been accused of illegal operations.
- Is that true?
- No.
But tonight, he told me there'd probably be a trial, and your father just died, and I shouldn't even...
I...
I see you're upset, but I don't know what to do.
Could you hold me in your arms?
Yes.
I'd like you to hold me in your arms.
"He's naked," cried the boy.
Everyone was whispering in their corner.
"He's naked!
A little boy said the king was naked!"
The king shivered.
He knew the boy was right, but thought, "I have to hold on to the end of the procession."
And he walked even more proudly to the palace.
So, what do you think?
He was naked.
He walked around the city naked.
Yeah, he was naked.
What else?
The little boy was mean.
- Why is that, Stephanie?
- Because he said so.
- That's stupid.
Bruce, he was naked!
Shouldn't the king know he was naked?
He didn't have to scream.
He could have murmured it in his ear.
People were lying not to show that they were stupid and because they feared to see the king's zizi.
- Zizi!
- Zizi!
I like the boy.
Me too.
We should go.
The next table is ours.
We have to stop the macaroni cheese.
Why?
It's a life that lacks stimulation.
Thanks for coming.
I know it's hard.
It's okay.
That's better, isn't it?
Hello.
I'm Rom, with an "M."
You have your aperitifs.
The wine list or the presentation of our dishes of the day?
It's okay.
We've already chosen.
We'll have two tricolor salads, a grilled salmon on his lentils and baked potatoes, and Alfredo pasta.
- Ron?
- It's Rom.
I'm sorry, Rom.
Can you prepare us to take it away?
They're macaroni cheese.
- When we go to Rom's...
How does job search work?
A lot of positions were already taken.
But I'm still getting answers.
I'm sure you'll find the right job.
How can you be sure?
I hope you find the right job.
Here, my father and I watched Hale-Bopp five nights in a row.
Voyager 2 will move to 4.3 light years of Sirius, the Great Dog, in about 196,000 years.
I brought you something.
Is that supposed to be a gift?
No, I took it without thinking.
"How to find a job that works for those affected..."
I thought it might be useful.
Are you hurt?
- No.
- I was just trying to help.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Try to be careful.
A jerk broke my heart a few years ago.
I need time to take things easy.
What did he do?
We were together, and he slept with other women.
We weren't physically together, but we were in a couple.
So I need time.
- No sex.
- That's right.
- Kisses.
- Yes.
- Hand in hand.
- Yes.
No sex.
Is that okay with you?
Yes.
It's only been a month!
The delay before knowing it does not appear in Scripture, Dad.
You're making up.
Don't worry.
I'm fine.
Have you heard from the court?
All right.
All right.
I'll tell him.
I love you, Dad.
Goodbye.
You can stay for an hour.
Maybe you'll have fun.
I'd have fun at home.
It's not the gates of hell, just my friends.
- You're great.
- You need to see the baby.
Her name is Ling Yao, which means "joli treasure de jade".
- It's beautiful.
- Isn't that right?
She's so small, we could give her any name.
- Her name's Ling Yao.
- That's what I said.
That was her name when we got her.
She's so...
- Look at her.
- Yes!
We have a video, of course.
You want to see the video?
No, thank you.
Where's the bathroom?
Downstairs, second right.
I'd love to see the video.
- You're an expert now.
- Let's see.
Tory, no need to know much about Islam to understand hunger, anger or despair...
But we don't understand these people, or what they think!
I don't understand the people of New Jersey.
Either you think that human beings share some similarities, or you throw away the sponge.
Buying a telescope is complicated.
We need to take stock of the use.
- Without a pun.
- What?
- Do you want to take stock?
- That's right!
Are you interested in the solar system, the moon, planets or intergalactic space, nebulous and star clusters?
For that, you need a larger lens with a Dobson support.
The apo glasses go up to 180 mm...
- Michael's looking for a telescope for Kerhonkson.
For the interplanetary space, you can consider larger and more...
Have you heard too much about telescopes?
No.
But some terms just flew over me.
All right, I'll do it again.
Three basic considerations.
The type of lens...
Come and say goodbye to Robin and Jen with me.
All right.
- Thanks for the news.
- You're welcome.
It's a big decision.
- Nice to meet you.
- Same thing.
I remember the other kids talking all the time before school or at parties whispering, and I was wondering what they were talking about.
It seemed so easy.
One, then the other.
And they were laughing.
New subject, and it's happening again.
I started the draft of my new book.
That's good.
I'll thank you first in my speech at the Newbery Prize.
- A reward for children's books.
You still want to make them talk?
It will be a typical New York family, except that they will be raccoons living in Central Park.
Your turn.
I think the father will work in the pub.
Instead of inventing, why not write about the real raccoons?
It's a children's book, no natural sciences.
I think I'd rather.
I'll believe it.
I didn't mean...
That's what I meant.
Do you want to...
Do you want to sleep with me?
I think so.
You said you needed time.
So, go really easy on it.
- That's not good.
- What is it?
Just a little gesture.
Aren't you curious?
But he doesn't dare to meet us.
Sometimes you have to dare instead of others.
- Beth?
- Honey!
Dad, Mom!
What are you doing here?
- We're here to see the play.
- I thought...
- Hello, honey.
Didn't you give me your entrances?
The Pierces were supposed to come, but they couldn't.
We're not ogres.
At least, Becky.
Her mother, Rebecca, and I'm Marty.
We've heard a lot about you.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
My daughter and I get along like we're throwing at a fair.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, honey.
I couldn't wait.
We don't see much of this kind of room.
I didn't know that theatre was still there.
The Cherry Lane is the oldest avant-garde Off Broadway theatre.
Before 1924, it was only a cardboard factory, then in the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the works of authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Eugene O'Neill were presented...
I also drank topics for discussion before a date.
- Ask Becky.
From 1951 to 53, the Living Theatre troupe of Julian Beck and Judith Malina played here.
In 1952, Judith Malina chased a fireman's captain with a spear from his staging of Ubu Roi.
The American premiere of the end of the game, by Beckett, was played here in 1957. Other premieres followed it as Oh on the good days, also by Beckett, in 1962,
LeRoi Jones' Ghost Metro, 1964,
Thornton Wilder's The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden...
But that's enough in the Cherry Lane theater.
- What about the '70s?
- In 1971, Godspell's first, and then...
- My dad's joking.
Excuse me.
The story is always fascinating.
Please join your seats, let's go!
Let's go?
They're dying to get their picture at the trial on the front page.
- It's on their faces.
- What does Mr. Beranbaum say?
He's a lawyer.
He cares.
If the FBI goes to trial, we'll negotiate this, right?
He's assured of it.
You don't need to be there.
You said showing our support would help.
- You had to tell her.
- He's right.
You have your job.
I can be replaced.
I must be there for you.
What are you being accused of, Mr. Buchwald?
For trying to help a friend.
- Beth's uncle...
- Eric Cooper.
...has appointed his daughter as financial director.
She's qualified, isn't she?
She went to Wharton.
Yes, she's qualified.
Uncle Eric is actually an old friend of my father's,
- Jennifer's his daughter.
- We're wrong when we get started.
I carried over the mistakes to give a better picture of her, even in the eyes of her father.
Nothing bad, but they see another Enron case.
- Could you go to jail?
- Adam!
No!
It's good you asked.
Bethy, I'm not going anywhere.
Any other questions, Mr. D.A.?
No.
He's comfortable.
You accused him, questioned him, embarrassed him...
I didn't understand what he was saying.
Maybe it's not her fault!
Monday, he's in court, you know?
It's not time to talk about prison!
- It seemed important to me.
- Important?
You know what's important, then?
You can't align two words with your feelings, but you know what matters to my family.
- I...
- My father's not a criminal.
- All right.
- Forget it.
- Beth?
- I'm going home!
And don't follow me!
Can I come in?
I'm so sorry.
They're chocolates.
I'm not Forrest Gump, you know...
No, I don't...
- Was that a joke?
- I know how to do it.
I'm sorry.
I...
I blamed you.
I'm afraid for my father.
- You might as well apologize.
- You said it was your fault.
I got an interview.
- Yes?
- Halloran Industries, Communication and Space Exploration Research and Engineering.
That's perfect!
Open your chocolates quickly, and let's go get some champagne.
- It's just an interview.
- In my family, we have a saying:
"It's never too early to sink the champagne."
You'd be good at this job, wouldn't you?
You just have to tell them.
That's impossible.
When is it?
February 3rd, 17 days.
All right.
You have time.
You're gonna practice during the day, and I'll help you at night.
They'll think I'm abnormal.
That's right.
Beth?
Beth?
Come on.
For most of the interviews, greetings are up.
Short greeting: "Hello, enchanted."
Basic greeting:
"Hello, my name is Jason.
Nice to meet you."
- Mr. Buchwald, what are you arguing about?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.
Greeting opening to dialogue:
"Hello.
Mrs. Austen?
"My name is Jason.
Nice to meet you."
Mr. Raki?
Elizabeth Buchwald.
I'll conduct the interview for the job we talked about on the phone.
- On the phone?
Got it.
The look.
Come to my office.
During the interview, aim to mention all your qualities at least once.
The assets are actually expenses, hidden to improve the company's revenues.
The exchange of eyes.
The candidate can circumvent the difficulty of the game of glances by fixing the front of the interviewer.
Training is necessary, because remembering it requires an effort.
- Beth?
- No!
One last time.
Can't you just think about yourself for thirty seconds?
- I'm sorry.
- No...
It's okay.
Tell me about your last job, Mr. Raki.
In your last job, what was your share of individual work?
What about as a team?
You say your relationship with the Cooper family is as personal as it is professional.
- Is that correct?
Eric Cooper and I have been partners for over 30 years.
We've become close friends.
- It doesn't mean...
- Tell us about your relationship with Jennifer Cooper.
She's a wonderful young woman.
I've known her forever.
Is it true that you would help her - for any problem?
Apart from your affection for his family?
Of course.
Mr. Buchwald, would you feel compelled to help Jennifer to preserve your reputation?
No.
Did you have an affair with Miss Cooper in 2001?
Objection.
Mr. Buchwald has paved the way.
I understand the interest, master.
Rejected.
Please respond.
Yes.
Briefly.
So Jennifer had the right to think that you would help her solve this problem.
It didn't...
One has nothing to do with the other.
Nothing.
Get up.
Sit down.
Mr. Raki.
Hello, Mr. Breindel?
My name is Adam Raki.
Nice to meet you.
Come on.
- Beth?
- Adam, is Beth here?
No.
Marty pleaded guilty.
The hearing is tomorrow.
The verdict depends on the discretion.
She's not answering the phone.
I called the school, but she wasn't there...
Do you know when she'll be back?
- No, I'm waiting for him.
- Adam, can you look into her calendar where I can reach her?
All right.
Marty's coming.
I have to go.
They keep it for the night.
Tell him to call me.
Tell him to call me right away.
I've been thinking about you all afternoon.
How'd it go?
I forgot my phone.
How's the interview?
- That's right.
- Right?
My father and I arranged the meeting.
Did you organize it?
I knew they'd come to the theater.
They wanted to know you.
Do you want to tell me how it happened?
You lied?
A little.
You got me!
Idiot, you fool of Adam!
I'm not... I'm sorry...
Calm down, please.
- No, I hate you!
- No!
I hope your father goes to jail.
I hate you.
- He's guilty.
Your mother called.
He's a liar, like you, and he's going to jail!
I hate you!
You're just a child.
Fucking ass.
You're just a kid.
Liar!
When I told Grandpa Morris I wanted to get married, he told me Marty was a good guy, but he was playing on the razor wire.
- What does that mean?
He's always looking for limits, at work, in love...
He even said he could end up in jail.
I told him that he didn't understand Marty, and that even if he ended up in prison, I would never regret marrying him.
I don't regret it.
We have to help him now.
Tell the judge what he means to you, the man he's always been,
Not to mention the wrong decisions he made.
It's okay.
It's okay, Mom.
I read that the planets were aligned as they were 30,000 years ago.
Didn't you get the job?
No.
Is that what makes you sad?
- I lost more jobs than...
- No.
Beth and I broke up.
She lied.
And I found out.
I can't trust him anymore.
They all look good.
Before military service, a girl made me a promise.
When I got home, she was waiting for me.
But I found out she didn't keep her promise, so I packed my bag, I left and I never spoke to her again.
Even if sometimes, the desire to do so was like an animal eating from the inside.
Thirty-five years.
It's the only memory that still paralyzes me in the middle of the day and makes me call myself an old stubborn fool.
It's not sorcerer.
I just advise you to go talk to that girl again.
No, I don't know.
You'll cross with liars everywhere.
True liars must be distinguished from liars who deserve to be loved.
If you called that girl, would you stop calling yourself a stubborn old fool, even if you were still old?
Sit down.
The court sentenced you to five years in prison, including two years in a federal detention centre, followed by three years of probation.
According to your plea agreement, you have a week to settle everything.
Report to Correctional Services Monday, February 9 at 9:00 a.m.
The session was adjourned.
You have a new message.
Adam, it's Rebecca.
Marty was sentenced to two years in prison.
We're all very tormented, but Beth...
Finally, we're going back to Westchester. 211 Richmond Road, Bedford Hills.
You have the number.
I thought you should know where she is.
They kept looking for me to sell them Eric Cooper.
"You shall not spread slander among your people."
At least I don't have anything to take away, do I?
We always take too much.
This time, just a toothbrush.
Excuse me.
Let's talk.
Bethy, Bethy.
Your mother will need your help.
Yeah, I know.
We do things out of envy and others out of obligation, we have to live with the choices we made.
You and your mother won't miss anything.
I have made the necessary arrangements.
In two years, I'll be home, and it'll all be over.
One more thing about Adam.
It's not for you.
It's not his fault, but he's more your child than anything else.
He'll never be the man you admire and you'll be proud of.
It's not fair that he hopes... the impossible.
People with this syndrome get married
- and form families...
- Marrying?
He lives in another world.
You don't need to make that compromise.
You know it's for the best.
You know that.
Beth?
Beth Buchwald!
Beth?
Beth Buchwald?
- Oh, my God!
I'm going.
-Adam!
- Beth...
We need to talk again.
You scared me.
I thought you were gonna hit me.
I would never do that.
The position was already filled.
They took someone else, but they had another one in an observatory.
They said I was the wanted person.
I start in April, but it's in Flintridge, California.
I want you to come with me.
I'll work, you'll write and you won't have to teach anymore.
Hello, I'm here.
I'm sorry you were going to jail.
I came to ask Beth to come with me to California.
I'm going to create chips for satellite guidance devices.
- I have a job in Flintridge.
- That's good.
Congratulations, Adam.
- But Beth can't come with you.
Her family needs her.
I need her.
I can't leave without her.
I'm sorry, Adam, but she can't.
You can't do that.
- Bethy...
- Don't talk for me!
- We agreed!
- Don't decide for me.
- We're in the middle...
- Calm down.
- You made your choices, liar!
Traitor!
Nothing will be the same as before.
I'm leaving,
- No matter what you say, you stay.
- Don't go!
- Leave me alone!
Don't touch me!
- Adam!
- Oh, my God!
Adam!
- Are you coming to California?
- No, I'm going to my house in town!
- What about California?
- I'll think about it.
- All right.
Mom!
I'll leave the car at the station.
Come back here!
Did it go wrong?
- What did he say?
- He didn't even want to see me.
I waited for an hour.
Then the guard told me he wasn't coming.
Your mother says he's not ready.
I thought if I went there...
I didn't think he'd refuse to see me.
- What are you gonna do?
We're leaving, aren't we?
We're flying tomorrow to California.
You should pack your bags.
Nothing is tidy.
Can you give me a minute?
Leave me alone.
I'm not sure.
I should be, right?
Do you know what you want?
We'll never look in our eyes knowing exactly what the other person feels.
That idea wouldn't make any sense to him.
He never said, "I love you."
I don't know what it would mean to him if he told me.
Feeling loved is important, but loving, my little one,
is indispensable.
I have to go.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
I love you, Beth.
Adam, why do you want me to go to California with you?
What do you mean?
Why do you want me to come?
You...
You're part of me.
And...
I need you to...
To help me find a place to stay, to show me the way to work, and to explain when people say crazy things.
I couldn't go without you.
I'm so sorry.
I can't leave.
If you want me to come because you can't go without me,
I can't leave.
- Are you sure about that?
- I have to go.
Alone.
I wanted to tell you I called her.
I had a hard time finding her, but we're gonna see each other again.
This woman is even more stubborn than I am.
I'm just trying to thank you, damn it.
You're welcome, Harlan.
The best resolution is obtained with several small telescopes called interferometers.
They combine the light waves collected from the same source, such as a star, and the waves form an interference when they overlap or cancel.
This is constructive interference or destructive interference, so the light from several telescopes produces a clearer image than that of a single telescope.
But sometimes it is better to raise your eyes directly to the sky.
Thank you very much, Mr. Raki.
All right.
Let's go out.
Be careful where you walk.
Adam.
The one on top is for you.
Carol?
Do you want me to help you?
Yes.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hello, Bryan.
You're still joining us, aren't you?
Great.
Dear Adam.
What a way we've come.
Toughly, Beth.
Adam and his parents were a family of raccoons who lived in Central Park, in the middle of New York City.
"They weren't really in their place, but they were there."
