On the eve of his 40th birthday,
Hector Apostolou had one thing in mind:
Connie.
For a moment, he gave himself up in his memories of her.
Then he made up his mind to make things right.
We need you to turn off a fire.
Surprise!
I'm 39 for another day.
But it's our last falter before you become deputy commissioner.
There, you're moving a little.
All right.
Thanks, guys.
You're a great team, and you're giving me a good image.
We've done so many things.
By Monday, when we're done, we can do even more and make New York more liveable, better, the sparkling city she wants to be where none of us can afford to live.
Cheers.
Do I have to cut it?
Hector?
It's the commissioner.
Take this.
Good luck.
You want to go down?
We got a cake.
40 years.
I get it.
I've never met her, but I understand.
I know the pressure you're under...
She's a very good choice.
Carl, I fully understand, and I am honoured to continue working for you.
Absolutely.
I'm chained to my office.
That's not how you have to pack a present.
Kids, stop yelling.
I'm on the phone with a patient.
Can I call?
A tape recorder?
I'll help you.
You're home.
Can you talk to the kids?
And listen to your father.
He's a very influential man.
Very influential, like Oz.
Put that mess away.
Come on.
Can an assistant commissioner arrest people?
No, but since I'm your father, I have the power to arrest you for life.
Who left his backpack on the porch?
Right?
Little monsters.
- Come on, monsters.
- I'll ship you.
Set aside, get up and brush your teeth.
Busy day?
You can't imagine.
The flu's everywhere.
And they keep trying to get me here to see new patients.
It's...
Your mother calls every 18 minutes asking what she can bring to the party.
Please, can you tell him to stop?
No.
Honey, call her and ask the goddess of the Parnasse not to bring her Athenian feast.
I'll call him.
Promised.
Oh, my God, wait, where are we headed?
The big news.
What happened?
How'd it go?
It went well.
Tell me.
What did he say?
How...
How did he tell you?
Give me the details, darling.
Did he take you upstairs and...
The mayor was there?
Aisha, he hasn't decided yet.
He'll be waiting for the weekend, so...
Honey, you won't know until Monday.
It's just... sadistic.
How can you work with these people?
The machine that is a municipal government has impenetrable ways.
It's okay.
Mom, can you come upstairs?
Can you go?
Really?
Please.
Oh, I just need a rhythm.
They don't know you the way I know you.
Connie, that's not right.
Dad?
Tell him to stop.
His broken dream,
Hector fell within the limits of his life where his few transgressions exist only in his dreams.
Are you sleeping?
Good.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
You monopolize him.
- That's right.
- No.
You said 30 minutes.
Adam, let me play.
Look, you turned it off.
No, it's you.
What's up, kids?
Adam won't let me play!
Adam, be a nice big brother and share.
- She called me a fat pig.
- You're a fat pig.
What's going on with the chips?
It's breakfast.
Let's go eat breakfast food.
Why don't you play outside?
It's beautiful.
Whatever.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Dad, I didn't want him to leave.
I just wanted him to play with me.
He's coming back.
You know he can't stay away from you.
Why did you get out of bed?
Because there's a birthday party in a few hours.
I'll make an arrangement.
Mm, so much arrangement.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so late.
If you're looking for your cigarettes, don't bother.
I threw them away.
You said you were gonna stop.
Tomorrow.
If you really want them, they're in the trash.
Can't we just tell them not to come today?
That's a good idea.
I'm not kidding.
Let's cancel.
Let's go out for dinner, let's go to the hotel.
Just you and me.
My love, there's 20 people coming.
I've been working on it for two days.
You're really useless.
Of course.
And speaking of which, did you call your mother?
I ran into the answering machine.
The only people I know who still have an answering machine.
I could use a Valium.
It's 9:00 in the morning.
Yeah, I know, but look who's coming.
Did you look upstairs?
We don't have one.
I've got some in the office.
If you can go get them...
Can you get some green wood?
And you need charcoal, lemons and ice cream.
Hector made a deal on the road.
If the light remained green, he wouldn't stop at the clinic to see Connie and take tranquilizers.
He wouldn't turn left but would go straight and stay straight.
Go learn how to drive, asshole!
I really like it.
I don't want it to stop.
Really?
I just want to sit there until it ends.
I've listened to this a hundred times, and every time it's so slow, I feel like it could stop.
No, I don't.
Can I smoke one?
No.
Probably not.
Aisha paid you, didn't she?
Are you babysitting this week?
Good.
Well, good night.
Hector considered what could happen if he let things go further with Connie:
Public humiliation, divorce, loneliness, despair, suicide.
It was covered.
I don't have the money.
I hear what you're saying.
I understand...
You don't understand.
I shouldn't have received that bill.
I know, but your...
It's your insurance that doesn't take that code.
But it's...
How are you?
It's an interesting moment.
Is that a good thing?
I think I'm gonna make this good.
I'm glad you're here because I finished the book you lent me.
Really?
I thought it was really cool, her ideas about cities that are like living organisms and how they grow up and learn things and...
I mean, thank you.
I'm glad you liked it.
We'll have a barbecue later.
For my birthday.
Would you like to come and see what the desperate contortions of a 40th anniversary are?
More than you can imagine.
We're closing at 2:00 today.
Then come on.
I need that girl.
The girl has to come back.
I have to go see what this woman wants.
All right.
She knows everything.
You have to pay attention to the right kindergarten, because the right elementary schools are watching.
I like to keep Hugo with me.
Besides, he can't learn anything in kindergarten that I can't teach him at home.
No, it's not that, Ro.
People in admissions like to see if he can adapt to other children, and that's the socialization thing.
She's right.
We should buy him a Yale tie and hang a word on him saying:
"Future avocado scumbag.
Take me."
Shut up.
Baby.
Happy birthday, darling.
Hugo?
The great Hugo.
How are you?
Hector, what do you think?
Should my son start preparing for the horrors of adult life now?
I don't know.
It's never too early to start losing your soul.
Where's my son?
Mom.
So elegant for a barbecue in a garden.
Oh, you.
40 years on this earth to pose problems, to make life hard for everyone.
Poor Aisha.
And Rosie.
And Hugo and Gregory.
The painter.
Gary.
Did you get a painting last Christmas?
Yes, of course.
We loved him.
But why did you draw the girl so ugly?
- Mom.
- What?
She's my sister.
- Poor thing.
- Yes.
Aisha, here.
Coffee cake.
Jews are much better than Greeks on desserts.
That's very nice of you.
You thought I was gonna come empty-handed?
Please.
Guys?
I need help unloading the car.
It's okay.
Hey?
I'm early, but I wanted to help.
- June, hi, honey.
- Hey!
Can I watch a movie?
We could leave some here for the homeless.
That's not your mother's opinion.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
40 is terrifying, isn't it?
You have no idea.
Yes, I remember my hair turned white at night.
You okay?
Hey, Uncle Mano.
Cousin, where can I park to prevent someone from stealing it from me?
Look at this huge vehicle!
It takes a big man to drive a car like this.
Right, son?
She's huge.
Especially if we're getting ready to invade Iraq.
Yeah, what we should do, so where do I park?
Just park on the street.
- On the street?
- Yes.
- Happy birthday.
- On the street?
- You park on the street.
- You're doing this?
We're in Brooklyn, so we park on the street.
I'm going down.
- Hey, Rocco.
- Hey, Uncle Hector.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You're taking me on a boat soon with Adam?
Hey, you look good.
My father gave me a moonfish.
Good to see you.
I'm glad to see you.
I'll be right back.
Happy birthday, sir.
You don't seem to have spent 40 years.
Thank you.
- Anouk.
- Manolis.
It's been too long.
I hope you have an appetite.
I fasted all week in anticipation.
He's my friend Jamie.
Happy birthday.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, my God!
You're in this show.
Yes.
I see you're not blind anymore.
Thank God.
You can wear the lamb.
My blindness lasted only one episode.
- he looks nice.
- Yes.
Is he a minor?
Don't start.
- Here.
- What did you bring?
A little something to help you manage your mortality.
It's medical, it's from California.
You always know what to bring.
No, thinner.
What happened to that oriental girl in the show?
You fired her?
No, Anouk did.
She thought the actress wasn't smart enough.
Smart.
Everyone can be smart.
That girl was funny.
Not bad.
Let's take this off for a little space.
Why don't we just leave it like that and I'll put some stuff in the lingerie?
No, it's too dirty there.
Here.
Thank you, darling.
Someone brought the right thing.
Hugo, is there a fire?
Hugo, go play with the kids.
- Honey, thank you.
- What a saint.
You sent Mehmet to work in the garden.
I love you.
You're welcome, Aunt Koula.
Nothing's too good for you.
This one, you know...
He is the largest seller of rare automobiles on the entire east coast.
He sold to Jay Leno.
What about this one?
My Hector, come here.
You know, he's very high in the municipal government.
I know.
And it's mine.
You didn't call them, did you?
Yes, I did.
They didn't answer.
All right?
Take this, come on.
Take this.
Hector!
Where are those plates I bought you, those with the roses?
I need it.
Can someone go open the door?
Why are you getting mad?
It's a party.
Enjoy your birthday.
Hugo!
No!
I didn't do anything.
You didn't do anything?
What's all this?
He didn't want to do anything wrong, Hugo.
No one's gone...
I'll give you the breast.
Come here.
Hey, Connie, come in.
I'm sorry.
I'm surprised.
I didn't... know.
Hector invited us.
Of course.
I just closed the clinic and I came.
Come in.
That's a very good idea, honey.
The kids are gonna be very happy.
Come in.
Hello.
Richie.
You're babysitting.
I remember.
All right, come in.
Hello.
Good to see you.
Richie, you want a soda?
- You know Richie?
- Of course.
So I bought this for you at Bergen Street comics store.
It's about buildings, because I know how much you like urban architecture.
- I hope you like it.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm glad you came.
Me too.
You want a soda, Connie?
I'm sorry you had to work today, Connie.
It's okay.
Was it loaded?
Not bad.
Here.
Thank you.
Don't play what's there, play what's not there.
Can I have a beer?
No.
Are you serious?
Yes.
You're a minor.
Richie, great camera.
Thank you.
I'll give you a penny per photo if you walk around and take pictures of all this.
All right.
I'll do it.
Free of charge, for your birthday.
Here's the one celebrating his birthday.
Hey, Carlos.
- Hey, man.
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah.
I saw him at the casting, and I thought, "God, let him be able to talk."
Turns out he's actually pretty smart.
- Is it serious with him?
- That should be.
I don't know.
Something's wrong.
There's always something wrong, isn't there?
What if he jumps the screenwriter to get more scenes?
That's how it started.
No, I think I really like him.
Really.
You really like him.
I've never heard you say that about anyone.
Including us.
Aisha, where's the olive oil I brought you?
I can't use yours.
Yes, I'll bring it to you.
Come on, man.
Let's not start.
The last time we met, you were explaining to me how it was actually the 1% getting fucked.
Guys, move on.
Anouk, the only thing I'm telling him is that I don't know how to judge art.
So the only criterion I have is how much it's worth.
You think I'm trying to offend you?
I'm just trying to have a real conversation.
You don't have to.
You're saying that because you don't know anything about art, you need a price to know if it's good or not.
That's right.
Which means my paintings and your used cars are in the same economic and aesthetic universe.
There you go.
And it makes me want to do a massacre.
Come on, guys.
That's enough.
We have presents.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go to the other room.
Let's see.
You didn't do that.
Yes, we did.
We're all taking you to Greece.
You and Aisha, and the kids and Rocco, Harry and Sally, everybody.
Mom.
Dad.
How can you...
Mom, Dad, it's too much.
The children must see the Parthenon, Delphi, Kyparissia, eat a fresh octopus fished, grilled on a rock.
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
You see, Rocco, Sandi, that's how we do it.
Aunt Koula, you're the best here.
Who's the best aunt in America?
Thank you very much.
It's important to us, too.
Not just for you.
Aisha, my dear.
What's the matter?
No, I don't know if I can...
We're understaffed at the clinic, we lost a doctor, and it's just...
But no, that's great.
I'm sure you can fix this, darling.
Yeah, it's not that simple, but...
Of course you don't want to come because it's gonna be fun.
Come on, Aisha.
We have to do this for the family.
My husband almost killed himself at work, the biggest coffee salesman in New York.
He was covering the whole city.
It's just, you know, we're just open, and we're just starting, and I said... I'm not leaving.
What are the dates?
Aisha and I will find a solution.
- What dates?
- We'll figure it out.
I'm sure you'll find someone to take your place.
I wish my life was that simple, Koula, but it's not that easy to find someone.
"Thank you."
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mom.
Thank you.
What?
You need to handle your wife better.
She's got to give in, now's not the time.
We're not home.
I don't run my wife.
We'll find a solution for this trip.
No, we won't, because I can't.
- I'll talk to them.
- Will you talk to them?
You're not even able to talk to them to tell them not to bring food to your party, so how are you going to tell them about...
They offered us a trip to Greece.
You know what that means to them?
You can find someone to replace you at the clinic.
I hate this assumption, that it's up to me to do...
Why don't you talk to your mother to tell her Aisha can't leave right now?
It's as simple as that, and you never do.
You don't support me.
You know, the tone you use, I'd like you to get along.
You know what?
Go to Greece without me.
Maybe I will.
Please go to Greece without me.
I'm going back to your birthday party.
- Great, just do it.
- Your mother's birthday party.
I didn't ask for this party.
It was your idea.
Maybe at least you can let me enjoy it, is that possible?
That's my game.
I want to play!
Adam?
Listen.
We're getting it, aren't we?
Let's be...
What's going on?
I'm trying to get Hugo to...
I have an idea.
Out.
It's time to eat.
Everybody out.
All right?
- Okay, don't get mad.
- I'm not angry.
Are you going to go with your friends?
No.
Are we going to see your mother?
No!
We're not doing this.
I hate it here!
I hate it!
All right, tough guy.
Adam?
Play with Hugo.
- Dad...
- We don't whine.
We don't care.
I'll help you.
No, I'm fine.
- You need help?
- No.
Here.
Is it good for meat?
No, leave her alone.
Thank you, Rose.
I don't understand what she's got.
Do that in front of all these people.
Good manners.
They have very complicated lives, let him deal with it.
You think he'll resist him?
Pretty much how I resist you, darling.
I'm just saying I don't know anyone who's booking tickets without checking the dates before.
Calm down, Gary.
There are people who like to spend time with their families.
But I see why hers doesn't want to.
If I may...
Sandi, can you cut jazz, if you don't mind?
It's much better like that.
You okay, Rosie?
We lost one, but I just want to say I love this guy.
He's more a brother to me than a cousin.
He pulled me out of embarrassment more than once.
And we've had a good time all these years.
And I hate to admit it, but this guy even passed tests for me, so...
But seriously, everything I've done,
Hector told me I could do it.
And he could have done anything in his life, he chose to do something to help this town.
Everyone I know wants to be rich and powerful, and Hector just wants to be good.
And Aisha made it even better.
So, to my cousin, the last good man in America.
With the exception of Manolis, of course.
Yours, cousin.
You can put jazz back on now, if you really want to.
Sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
No, it's good for the trial.
A man considering suicide on his 40th birthday.
You have a beautiful smile.
It's brilliant.
You should smile more.
God knows.
Honey, don't do this.
You're hurting the flowers.
Give me that.
Come on.
All right, guys, now's the time for sports.
We've got foam bullets.
Let's go.
Here we go.
Come play, stop it.
All right, who wants to set the foundation?
I'll do it.
Richie?
You want to stop taking pictures and help me?
- I'll take this.
- Yeah, all right.
You want to form teams?
We're playing.
All right.
Hugo?
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
I'll take care of it.
After all, I planted them.
I'm sorry.
Everything's gonna be okay with the trip?
Yeah, I hope so.
I have to work on it.
I hope so too.
You know what?
I was facetious earlier.
But I don't think there's one thing we agree with.
Come on, Gary.
Don't dramatize.
I'm sure we can find something.
You think the Nazis were bad?
Let's not talk about the Nazis...
It's a party.
Come on.
I almost got you.
All right, that's the second hit.
Wait, wait.
Whose turn is it?
You want a beer?
No, you okay?
I think I'll take one.
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Yeah, it's outside.
Throw it first.
All right...
Good hit!
It was a good hit.
Home run!
Touch it.
Are you having a good birthday?
As well as a 40th birthday can happen.
We both love our kids, don't we?
We want them to be happy and healthy.
We can agree on that.
Our children are mysteries beyond our understanding, poto.
They don't even belong to us.
They are long-term guests.
You know, I'm not completely on the problem you've got with me.
No one has a problem with anyone.
Maybe it's because he's rich.
- It's just money.
- Let's do this quietly.
It's a little too late for that.
Are you sad?
- You look a little...
- No.
I'm incredibly happy.
I don't feel...
I don't feel my 40s.
I'm not pretending.
I don't know what happened.
I'm just losing control of the elements.
- Third shot.
- You're out.
Okay, who's next?
Oh, Hugo, you want to go?
The rich, they....
They're destroying New York, destroying the whole world, brick by brick.
This guy's got a problem.
He says you should try my macaroons.
Did he really say that?
Oh, Hugo, you can't use that bat.
You have to use the bat for the foam ball.
I want to use that bat.
It's okay, guys.
Let him use this one.
He can't hit anything anyway.
All right, Hugo, are you ready?
At random, I'd say, like, 28.
And a half.
Oh, and a half.
A small half-line right there.
It's been two shots, Hugo.
One more and you go out.
At 28, I'd still be too old for you.
It's over, Hugo.
You're out.
No, I've got another trick.
It's always my turn!
Hey, Gary, Hugo maybe shouldn't be throwing his bat like that...
Hugo, it's Adam's turn.
You're out, buddy.
You had three shots.
I'll explain later.
We'll practice.
Put the bat down right now!
Hugo, Hugo, hey, put the bat down, okay?
Listen to me.
When adults talk to you, you listen to what they say, yeah?
Why are you throwing your bat at Rocco like that?
What the hell is wrong with you, animal sal?
What's going on?
Why is Hugo crying?
He hit him.
He hit his son.
You son of a bitch.
Hey, come on.
All right, easy, easy.
What did you do?
You hit my son!
Your son was out of control!
You didn't see him swing the bat to my son, did you?
Don't make it worse!
Not in front of the kids!
He's fine.
Look at me.
He's fine.
He's fine.
- I don't blame the child.
- I blame you!
You two don't know how to raise a child!
Is that on his face?
Of course he's fine, I didn't hit the little bastard.
Oh, no, don't say it in Greek.
- I kept it for that asshole.
Don't say a word again.
Your cousin didn't do anything wrong.
It was the other's fault.
Stop it, for God's sake, Koula!
You have to take control of yourself.
Come on.
Come on.
Breathe.
You have to shed light on your mind.
Come on.
Really.
Come on.
Fascinating hippie.
Pig!
- Gary.
- What?
I'm so sorry.
- Did he hit you, too?
You want to talk to my wife?
- Calm down.
- Talk to me, Gary.
You want another beer first?
Go upstairs, all right?
Take a walk.
Let's go get Rocco.
Let's get Rocco and get out of here.
Why?
Didn't you see him swing the bat to Rocco?
Oh, come on.
What am I supposed to do, huh?
We should go.
We should just leave.
I'm so sorry, Hector.
We have nothing to blame, Sandi.
No, no, no, she's right.
You should.
Let's get Rocco and go.
I think it's time for you to leave.
The party's over, don't you think?
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
I'm so sorry.
Take your sister and go upstairs.
Hey, it's not your fault, okay?
It's not your fault.
Do you understand?
Okay, go ahead.
It's my fault.
I'm so sorry.
Does it still hurt?
Look upstairs.
And downstairs.
That's good.
- Have some coffee, Gary.
- No, I don't need it.
I'm gonna sue that bastard. I'm gonna send him to jail.
Goodbye, darling.
He's fine, Rosie.
His eye's fine.
We're just gonna keep that ice cream on his cheek.
I'll call you a cab.
I can go chez me, thank you.
The dirty kid deserved it.
You're gonna hit another person's child.
If parents can't control their child, who will?
Alcohol and sexual freedom!
Koula, is that useful?
Hector, how can we be most useful to you right now?
The best thing would be for you to come home.
- We need to be alone.
- Of course.
All right.
Happy birthday.
I can't believe he hit that little kid.
- I'm sorry, but who's doing this?
- Connie.
- Not even his own child.
- Listen.
What we're doing, please, I'm sorry if I put you forward, but it has to stop.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand.
Look, I think you're really special, really.
But I love Aisha, okay?
- I love him, too.
- You don't believe me.
- No, I know.
I hate what we do.
I think it's disgusting.
Okay, so to protect Aisha, better not say anything about it, right?
It's so twisted.
That's...
Yeah, it's okay.
Don't worry.
I'd never want anyone to know.
He's a messed up man.
And we all pretend we don't notice.
I know.
I know.
I can't defend him.
Well, this time it's not gonna pass.
He hit a kid, and it's against the law.
What about his story?
Aish...
I know this was the worst birthday party for you, honey.
Aisha.
We'll clean this up, me and the kids.
I need to tell you something.
So I didn't get the job.
Oh, you didn't get the job.
They hired a woman.
She's smart and Latin.
