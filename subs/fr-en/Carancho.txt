22 deaths per day, 683 per month, 8,000 per year, 100,000 in the last ten years.
In Argentina, road mortality mainly affects children under 35 years of age.
The compensation market is flourishing.
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come this way.
Move!
- Where do you know my father from?
- Football.
- What club?
- Morón.
- What club, son of a bitch?
- Stop...
- Which club?
- Almirante Brown.
Say it again!
Son of a bitch!
Which club was my father in?
What team?
What club was my father in, you son of a bitch?
Laferrere.
- Don't you remember?
- I don't know...
You could have waited for him to be buried!
Fucking snitch...
Let's get out of here.
Respect the dead, you son of a bitch!
- You dirty rapist...
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Are you ready, Luján?
Hurry up, please.
I'm coming.
Come on, hurry up!
Funeral pumps
Do you read me, Sosa?
Motorbike to van accident between Mosconi and Villegas.
Don't worry.
It's okay.
I see him, he's over there.
Take the stretcher, Pico.
Good evening.
What happened?
He cut off the road at the van.
Big shock to the head, no helmet.
- Do you know if he's drunk?
- I didn't feel anything.
- Do you know his name?
- Gustavo, I think.
Did he stay conscious?
He was talking a few minutes ago.
- Gustavo, can you hear me?
I'm a doctor.
I'll put on a neck collar and we'll take you to the hospital.
- You know what happened?
- No.
You don't remember anything?
How old are you, Gustavo?
24.
- Were you working?
Stay calm.
Can you help me lift him?
Let go of his head and come next to me.
I have my first aid certificate.
All right.
Put one hand here and grab the other side.
I count to three and we lift him up.
Ready?
One, two, three...
Stay calm.
One, two, three...
Let's put it down.
It's okay.
Officer, can you help us?
Are you okay?
Me?
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Did you hit him?
- No, it's something else.
- Don't move.
- Let's go, Luján!
You need a stitch.
Thank you.
Pico!
- You know him?
- What?
You know the guy who helped us?
Yes.
Why?
He's following us.
Don't worry, he's coming to the hospital.
- They won't.
- Why?
- I don't know.
There's no one here, it's a mess... always the same bullshit.
- She insists.
- Who's that girl?
She's new.
She's a friend's sister.
You have intensive care and a scanner.
I'm sorry, I can't take it.
I'm not going anywhere, so find a solution.
Talk to the head of department.
- Excuse me.
- Is Russo here?
- Yes.
Can you call him?
I'll check it out.
What do I do?
Wait.
Gustavo, are you okay?
It's amazing...
Don't worry.
Excuse me.
Pico, I'll put the file down and I'll meet you outside.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.
No problem?
No, it's all right.
- Thanks for the help.
Can I have your name?
Olivera.
- What's your name?
Luján. Luján Olivera.
- You want to see my badge?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Keep it, you never know.
See you soon.
Thank you very much, Sosa. Ciao.
How long have you known Sosa?
- Yeah, that's a lot of time.
It's been eight or ten years.
- It's always been a "rapace"?
- No.
Only since he lost the right to exercise.
He's working for the Foundation's rotten kids.
At first, it's 200 pesos the info.
If they're interested, it's 300 more.
Are the victims compensated?
It's the scam, but they're getting money.
These people don't have a job, they don't have a job.
The Foundation almost plays the role of social worker.
Social worker?
Yeah, social worker.
For the guy who gets hit and is in a thousand pieces, that's the right plan.
The raptors come and help him scum the insurances.
We're almost here.
What did they hit you with?
I was going home and they attacked me.
I hurt myself when I fell.
My head hurts, Doctor.
You clearly remember everything?
Yeah, more or less.
- Are you a cop?
- No, I'm a doctor.
Try to calm down a little.
I'm here to help you, to heal your head wound.
Once you're in the hospital, you'll be taken care of.
- I want to go.
- Now it's impossible.
Once you're in the hospital, you'll be free to leave.
- I love you.
- That's good.
Stay calm, sit calmly.
Stop touching me and try to calm down.
Bitch.
Bitch?
What's the matter with you?
Calm down!
- What's going on?
Kiss me.
Come on, I'll kiss you.
Calm down, let go of me!
Let's get back to it.
Try to remember the details.
There was a witness, right?
The neighbor said it was the truck's fault.
He was driving without headlights and countersense.
He didn't have time to avoid it, Master.
They said it was an accident.
If it could be avoided, it's not an accident, it's an incident.
The police photographed the car.
I don't know.
- Did you file a complaint?
- Yes, I did.
Where's the paper?
My wife must have it at home.
- Who rescued you?
- Police officers.
By the way, they saw me walking out of the car.
- They took you to the hospital?
- Yes.
Which doctor treated you?
I don't know anymore, a doctor dressed in green or white.
- Did you do radios?
- Yes.
- Hey, Sosa.
- Do you have these radios?
- It won't pass at trial.
- It's not my fault.
Tell Guerrero he's got 20 points.
Is it so difficult, Casal?
What's wrong with your face?
Nothing, forget it.
Maybe I should escort you.
What's the Dog doing here?
Are you sleeping or what?
- It's all served to you on a set.
- Let go of me.
You have people under your command, a car, an office, a secretary...
If you're here, I'll do it.
This document allows us to take over the presentation of the case.
It's not possible, it can't be true.
I don't know what to do, Master.
We'll take care of everything.
I know.
My neighbors told me something about you, but I'm not sure.
One thing after another.
Look for the police station!
That's where you're buried!
No, the real problem is from here!
Calm down.
Master Casal, can you come over for a moment?
Madam is Mr. Arrieta's widow.
The Mármol Calle accident.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
Wake up.
I'll wait outside.
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?
- What do we got?
- Highway accident.
Pico...
Let's go?
I told you, it's a lot further.
It's okay, we're almost there.
Put your belt on, Pico.
We've talked about it thousands of times.
I'm sick of it.
You can't leave now.
Look at me.
I can't take it anymore.
Are you tired?
All right, I'll take a walk.
It's not from today.
I've been tired for a long time.
I'm in the same condition as you.
Do you know how tired I am of the Dog?
He refuses any change!
I don't care.
As soon as I can practice again, I'm leaving.
Today, I'm talking to Rinaldi.
I need you here.
What do you mean, you want to leave or stay?
I won't let anyone eject me.
If anyone has to leave, it's the Dog.
Rinaldi wants to bring him down, he told me.
How long do you think he has left?
It's over for him.
Don't underestimate the Dog.
Listen to me.
We must be more united than ever.
Come on, man...
You want to blow me up?
You, they believe you, I don't.
Mr. Moyano, the taxi company called me, the car's a little late.
I'm not Mr. Moyano.
Excuse me, Mr. Moyano had an accident.
I'm his lawyer, but I've never seen him before.
I had an accident, too.
What happened?
Some asshole hit me with his van.
- When?
- Yesterday.
- Are these your x-rays?
- Yes.
May I?
She was going to work.
A car that came out of the box spilled it.
- What time?
- At dawn.
- Married?
Kids?
- Yes, married, two children.
Do you know her husband?
Yes, he's on his way.
You've got some things to get back, Sosa.
Go to the regulars.
Copy that.
I'll wait for you.
Hello, Sosa.
- Here's all the papers.
- Perfect.
Tell me about the case of Avenida Almafuerte.
A 82-year-old woman, hypertensive, had a hypertensive peak.
- There were six victims.
- Good evening.
- Hey, Pico.
- Shall we eat?
- What about the Avenida Mosconi guy?
- Which one?
The story of the overturned cyclist.
There was a failure from the bank and the guy's insurance policy wasn't taken.
The same day, he killed a cyclist.
- Goddamn it!
- The cyclist must have burned the fire.
There's always one who's messing around.
Insurance is here to pay, but an accident is still an accident.
What about the girl from the car school?
She's been a monitor for years.
She was driving quietly and in front of her windshield, she sees a guy falling stiff dead, killed by a pot of flowers.
It was such a shock to her that her heart stopped clean.
The car deviated, she got on the sidewalk and crashed a kid who was actually her nephew.
- That's bullshit.
It's happening.
The truck's on its way.
You guys ready?
There's nothing for you, Sosa.
See you.
Luján!
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
I don't take care of medical mistakes.
It's a long time, it's not worth anything...
I'm leaving the doctors alone.
Good.
I'd like to change the way you look at me.
- What do you mean?
- Looks like I'm scaring you.
You don't scare me.
Do you like working here?
Yeah, I like it.
But I don't want to keep guards my whole life.
While you're waiting better, you're content.
- It's the same for me.
What are you waiting for?
A big carbble?
No, I don't know.
I'd like to change air, get out of here.
But I'm not sure.
Actually, ever since I met you regularly, I've been thinking about staying.
- Is that your dredge technique?
- No, it's true.
- I'm not good at...
- Let's go, Luján.
I have to go.
What time do you end... your guard?
I'm coming!
Eight o'clock.
Maybe a little earlier.
Can I wait for you?
Whatever you say.
- I'll wait for you.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, what about you?
- I'm done.
- How was it?
Yeah, but I'm tired.
I think I should go to sleep.
Can I buy you a little coffee?
Five minutes...
You graduated and went to your boarding school there, and since there were few places, Pico got you that job.
It's not that bad.
What about you?
What, me?
What did you do to get suspended?
Nothing.
I just didn't get a chance, that's all.
Oh, good.
But I feel like she's spinning.
- What are you talking about?
- My luck.
Why?
See the fire over there?
Look.
If two cars go red, I'll kiss you.
- Are you crazy?
- It's for the game.
I want to prove to you that my luck is ticking.
- You're not getting wet.
- You prefer three?
Ten.
You exaggerate and you know it.
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Let's say four.
It still doesn't hurt.
But go for four.
Come on, help me out.
And one.
It's okay.
Two.
Two.
Go on.
- lorries don't count.
- Of course I do.
Three, four...
Five.
I did it.
And they weren't trucks.
- I don't kiss you, though.
- Then I do.
- I have to go.
- I'm wrong here.
Shall I shut up?
Will it be ready today?
Yes.
"Superior Insurance" is good.
Is that still valid?
Yes.
It's okay.
How much do you want?
I'll leave it to you for 500, with the repairs.
I hereby authorize the lawyer to collect the sum corresponding to the quota pact read, less the amount obtained as compensation.
The contract is signed in duplicate.
When do I touch the rest?
I told you, we have to wait.
I know, but I could be 300 in advance, Héctor?
Finish reading.
I'll be right back.
How much do you want to give him?
Give him 200 more.
I saw Rinaldi.
It's on the tracks.
You have to meet him.
- The same story again?
I don't trust you.
You'll never be as well treated as you are here, Sosa.
That's 200 more.
Thanks, man.
- Now what do I do?
I'd drink a little beer.
Vega, you're a drunk.
Hello.
Finally!
Come on.
Are you all right?
Yes.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
You fell asleep.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- How long have I slept?
- Almost 12 hours.
Are you hungry?
You don't like talking too much when you wake up.
No, I'm not used to it, that's all.
Do you want a hand?
Cut some pepper and zucchini.
- This one?
- Yes.
Both.
Like this?
Yes.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm making a replacement.
Where's Santillán?
I don't know, I've been called, I'm going to change.
You make a quick arpeggio with your thumb and nails.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
The thumb down marks the serious notes.
And the rest of the hand... plays sharp notes.
Third, second, first...
You go back to arpeggio with thumb and nails.
Hand, hand, hand, hand...
Look at me.
For the samba, everything is in the scratch technique.
I'd love to know how to play an instrument.
- Are you playing?
You smell like alcohol.
- No...
- Stop lying.
No!
- Do we have to wait yet?
- No, it's okay.
Keep your leg tight.
The little ones should all learn to play.
Bite in there.
- Do you feel anything?
- Sure?
- Yes.
Don't be a coward!
Let's go.
Don't scream.
Hold on.
Come on, come on.
Be strong.
Listen to me.
Do you remember what I told you?
Don't look at him.
Yes!
Come on, hold on.
What happened?
It never happened to me!
- What a jerk!
- He jumped on the windshield.
Sir, are you okay?
Never, in 30 years of license!
Where are we going, Pico?
About an accident.
Regul didn't call us.
Whatever.
Stand by, we're coming.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm working!
- Of course, I'm sorry.
- What happened?
Apparently, he has a fracture in his head and leg.
- He lost a lot of blood.
- When did this happen?
A few minutes ago, no more.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
- Did he stay unconscious?
You know what his name is?
Vega, he's a friend.
The stretcher.
Put one hand there, and the other one in front.
One, two, three... we lift him up.
One, two, three...
- Let's put it down.
- Be careful.
I'll put a strap here.
Tie the other strap.
It's okay, we can get up.
Can you explain to me what happened?
Not now.
- Ready?
- One, two, three...
I'll tell you everything.
- You take it, Pico?
- I got it.
Get in with me.
What happened?
I'll explain everything to you later.
Save him.
Help me.
I'll tell you everything, I promise.
Put those gloves on.
- What am I supposed to do?
You know what he took?
Tramadol and codeine.
Why?
To not feel the pain.
I don't understand.
I'll explain everything to you.
He's making a stop.
On my signal, you press twice.
- What am I supposed to do?
- When I tell you, you're bloating.
One, two...
When do we get here, Pico?
- In seven minutes.
- Call and say he's in custody.
This is truck 28.
We have a man about 65 years old.
Save him!
Shut up and focus.
Come on, one, two...
We'll be here in seven minutes.
Hang on, man.
What do we got?
A highway accident.
He's a 65-year-old man. He's lost consciousness.
He's on a standstill and we've been massaging him for seven minutes.
Did you give him something?
A known allergy to a drug?
I don't know.
I beg you...
65-year-old patient on call, polytraumatized.
On three.
One, two, three...
Bring the stretcher, Pico.
Can you plug in the oxygen?
Take that catch.
Defibrillator!
- Give me some gel.
- Defibrillator on.
We're laying a venous path.
- It's charging.
- Give me the oxygen.
Let's get out of here.
I'm shocked.
What can I do?
Go to admissions and leave your transmissions.
Give me something to intubate.
How's he doing?
Luján, how's he doing?
He's dead, Sosa.
It can't be!
He can't be dead!
He's dead.
Do you understand?
Let go of me.
Please wait outside.
Doctor?
- I'm Deputy Commissioner Ibáñez.
- Master Casal, good evening.
You were on the morelli calle's operation?
I need a copy of your report, please.
Talk to admissions.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
We'll need your ID and details of the accident.
If you'd like to cooperate...
He wanted to take care of you.
Excuse me.
Calm down.
We've done everything we can.
Easy.
- It's impossible...
I've got a detail to deal with.
Wait!
Are you crazy about me getting into your story?
It must have been just a guy with a broken leg.
Are you kidding me?
I'm the one signing, you got nothing to lose!
- I'm going home.
- Listen.
Don't touch me.
Okay, but it's very important.
What did they tell you?
Don't sign anything, don't say anything, it's up to me.
What the hell is that?
You shouldn't have been involved.
I have nothing to forgive you.
A man died because of you.
Even if you don't believe me, I was doing Vega a favor.
He needed money.
Everything was supposed to be fine.
I don't know what to do.
It's up to me to find a solution?
You're big enough, Sosa.
I never want to see you again.
There he is.
Come on, Sosa!
Come on!
- What about him?
- A patient for surgery.
The samples are taken.
He has abdo pain.
- The chir has to see him.
- Is he warned?
He's not here.
- What about him?
He had a big fall, an open fracture and a head trauma.
- Did you do radios?
- Yes.
Scanner?
- No, not yet.
- He didn't go through the trauma.
- What about this patient?
- A suspicion of tuberculosis.
Show...
Why isn't he in isolation?
I didn't see him, and there's no beds.
Are you interested in taking custody on Friday?
- Of course.
- It doesn't look like it.
Friday, I had my day, and I'm tired.
To be titularized, you have to accumulate the hours.
- So you're taking it?
Thank you.
I can't hear anything.
Quick, there's still two more.
All right.
No abdominal defense.
Go on, I'll take care of it.
What happened?
I don't know.
A fight.
- Where'd you get hit?
Have you lost consciousness?
Are you there, motherfucker?
Son of a bitch!
- Let go of me, bitch.
- Calm down!
Stop!
Call security!
Easy!
Calm down!
Stop, stop!
- Security!
- She's coming!
What was that?
A shot.
Don't move.
Stay where you are.
You okay?
Come on.
Are you calmed down?
Yeah, it's okay.
They're gonna take a lot of money.
You freaks.
Put the mermaid on, let's move on!
It's red.
What do you want me to do?
Or do you prefer the other one?
Since he left the Foundation, I haven't seen him again.
He still owes me money.
It's been a while.
I saw him at San Martín Hospital.
I ran into him in the hallways.
Didn't you see him either?
- So, what's up?
The lawyer called to find out if I knew about the five days in Tablada.
I said no.
He told me he'd go anyway.
A man for traumatism.
A woman for surgery.
A 25-year-old man to put in solitary confinement.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no. no, no. no. no, no. no. no. no. no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.
The prescriptions are here.
What are you doing here?
- I called you.
- I know.
I left you some messages, but you never answered.
I need to talk to you.
It's not possible here.
Tell me where and when, I'll be there.
You have to listen to me for a minute.
- Are you all right?
What about you?
Good.
When?
I don't know, I've got work to do.
What's wrong with you, Sosa?
You changed after you saw the Virgin?
Did Jesus talk to you?
That money doesn't belong to you.
You're gonna have to break bones to pay back.
In the meantime, I'll keep tearing down your portrait.
What do I say to Casal?
What do I tell him?
We've known each other for a long time, Sosa.
You know I'd rather be with Romina, or with my kids in front of TV.
Instead, I have to come back and put the ideas in place.
What do I say to Casal?
Let's be clear, Sosa.
Here, the only person in charge is you, you piece of shit.
A guy with a wound in his head has been asking for you for ten minutes.
Sosa, are you kidding me?
What happened to you?
Nothing...
Have you seen your face?
- Can you do it?
- Yes, of course.
Come with me.
- What about my jacket?
- I'll take it.
A little faster.
- This way.
- I'm sorry.
Vega must have been my last shot.
I've done it a lot of times.
Everyone could count on it.
It was my last mission for the Foundation.
Don't move.
My suspension lifted, I was supposed to be free.
And in the middle of this mess, you appeared.
And I felt things could change.
But obviously... something must have been wrong.
Something...
Don't move.
It's very strange.
I feel like I'm getting out of jail.
Even with the right to exercise, I couldn't stay here.
It was a warning.
I'm gonna go straight.
Is that right?
I've been busted to get your attention.
I got Vega's money back and I gave it to his wife.
She deserved it.
I don't care if I get my face broken.
I can't keep working here, Luján.
I don't want to be a hospital subscriber.
I have to get out of here.
I had two options:
Either say goodbye, or ask you to come with me.
What do you think?
That you don't know what you're saying.
- I'll be right back.
- He got hit.
- What do you mean, when?
He must have been sewed, what about all this?
Yeah, I made him two points.
You'd have made him ten!
You cracked the first day.
- You're stupid!
- You can see it on your face.
You're stupid.
What the fuck happened to you?
Are you stupid or what?
I've had enough of this shit already, don't add any more.
I want no one to leave me alone.
I don't give a shit!
This sector is not yours.
You screwed up the Vega case, you kept my money and that's not enough for you?
Deduce him from what you owe me and we're even.
- Quit?
- Absolutely.
You're not in a position to negotiate.
You know what?
Get out of here.
I don't want to work with you anymore.
It's been way too long.
Let me work alone.
I'm picking up some money and getting out of here.
I understand you.
But these are my accidents, my clients, my clinic, my hospital...
Even San Justo and the whole country are mine.
Get the hell out of here if you don't want any trouble.
Or if you prefer... you can take care of associations, divorces, inheritances...
Francisco Abendaño, bus accident.
The insurer paid him 30,000.
Delia Ortega, pregnant, overturned on the pedestrian crossing.
I remember it perfectly.
150,000 paid, 25,000 received.
Rodrigo Suárez, motorcycle accident.
112,000 paid, 35,000 received.
Do I keep going?
Are you the voice of my conscience?
No, but I have their numbers, idiot.
I have copies of the minutes of the agreement.
If they sue you all, you're a dead man.
Until when are you going to play the loudest?
Who's gonna defend you?
Rinaldi?
Who?
Are you threatening me, or what?
Are you crazy?
Did you forget what I did for you?
I helped you get up, I gave you work...
- You're gonna make me cry.
- Go on, cry!
Listen to me!
You give me a little time, I'll throw some money aside and I'll get out of here.
It's no more complicated.
You get it?
I'm dreaming!
- Calm down.
- You're fucking with me.
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Son of a bitch!
Did you see Nevares, the patient with an FA?
- Did you give him heparin?
- Of course.
Are you crazy?
You want to kill him?
Didn't you see he was bleeding digestively?
No, I'm sorry.
- Where'd you get your head?
- I didn't sleep.
We're all tired.
You're gonna kill one.
Go take care of it.
I was about to leave.
You'll leave when it's settled.
Doctor, we're waiting for you upstairs.
- Quick, Luján.
- What's the matter?
An accident between a truck and a car.
- How many victims?
- We've got six.
Six?
Three of them are in serious condition.
How many are we?
There's Juárez, you and me.
- Where's Garrido?
- He's on duty.
Doctor, please help us!
What happened?
Calm down.
He's choking!
Stay here and calm down.
- What do we got?
Easy, ma'am.
If you scream, there's nothing I can do.
Wait outside.
Let's go.
Take off his shirt and put some oxygen on him.
Is the way good?
Calm down, sir.
He can't breathe.
- Is he hypertensive?
- Yes.
Give me some Betadine.
Take a slow breath.
He's down.
Come on, let's go.
He's breathing better.
Can you hear me, sir?
Take a look at him.
- Breathe.
- Take a deep breath!
- Go on like this.
He's ventilating, it's okay.
Go ahead, if you want, I'll stay.
Put the necklace on him and it's okay.
Call surgery.
The necklace is in place...
- I'll stay with him.
- It's all right, sir.
Take a deep breath.
I had only one brother, Doctor.
Tell yourself your husband is safe and sound.
That's right.
Thank you, Doctor.
It's okay.
What am I gonna tell my mom?
- Everything in time.
- Doctor!
You'll find the words to tell him.
It's awful...
Wait.
Promise me.
- What?
- That you're gonna go straight.
- I already told you.
- Promise me again.
I promise you again.
Is it okay?
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
I'm doing it for her.
Me too.
Thanks for trusting me.
You're welcome.
My family is in talks with another firm.
According to them, it's better to have the same lawyer.
That's not true.
You're free in your choice.
Don't sign anything yet.
Bring me the papers and I'll explain my proposal.
All right, Master.
What are we gonna do for my brother?
My sister-in-law is desperate.
We're not told anything at the hospital or the police.
They even refuse to return the body to us.
Get me the X-rays, I'm on call all night.
Olivera, can you come over for a minute?
What's going on?
Are you out of your mind?
- What are you doing?
- I don't understand.
Don't play naïve with me.
You're helping the rapist around the hospital?
No.
Don't think I'm a jerk.
Take care of what you're doing.
It might end badly, but you might regret it.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
I think you're wrong.
The only mistake is you.
I'll have warned you, don't forget it.
Hello.
Hello.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
What are you looking for?
Did my stuff stay in the hospital?
I put everything in your bag.
- You want them?
- No, it's okay.
- You can go if you want.
- Is that what you want?
I want you to stay.
Then I'll stay.
Thanks for bringing me home.
- He came here.
- Who?
The big bunny.
- And?
- He asked me if I saw you.
- Do you have the papers?
- Yes.
Make sure everything's there.
What are you up to?
Make yourself discreet in the next few days.
- Tell Ibáñez that Sosa is asking.
- All right.
- What can I get you?
- A glass of water.
Don't you think I can see you're plotting with Casal?
I'm sick of it!
- Hey, Sosa.
Sosa, I'm sorry about the wait.
It's okay.
You like to surprise me.
You leave the Foundation without saying a word, slamming the door.
It's a lack of respect.
That's exactly what it is.
You come in here without warning.
- No, I warned...
- Who?
No one!
You're working on the road three accident?
- Do you already have the powers?
Casal has the other three.
And what are you doing here?
I want to be able to work quietly.
Casal's very stressed, he keeps me from working well.
- I need you to control him.
- Yes...
He wants to piss me off, Casal.
He's plotting with Rinaldi.
It's always the same story.
The weak ones want to strip the strongest.
- I don't want to strip anyone.
- I do!
I want the five powers back.
You're gonna bring them to me, not Casal.
We're doing each other a favor.
That's how it works, isn't it?
What do you need to get these powers?
Time.
You'll get some.
I'll take care of Casal, he won't piss you off.
When you have the signed powers, bring them to me.
If everything goes well, I have big plans for you.
Master, we want to negotiate, but the situation is very complicated.
You have some files, Mr. Casal has others.
It would be easier for a law firm to defend all the victims.
- Do you understand?
- Perfectly good.
If you prefer, we can continue this discussion in court.
Mr. Casal called me five times today to tell me that your powers have been revoked.
And you believe what Casal says?
Casal?
We'd like to invite you.
We're celebrating my daughter's 15th birthday.
Thank you very much.
You're coming, aren't you?
- When is it?
- Next Saturday.
I'm working this Saturday.
I'm on duty.
Please try to get by.
Thanks to you, my husband is alive and we can celebrate the birthday.
We'd love to.
You'll be our guest of honor.
Everybody in the picture!
Are you ready?
Smile.
Perfect!
Another one.
Yesstiti!
Smile, Grandma.
With such an offer, he signed, it makes sense.
It's the same story with your file.
After a year, you'll see that the trial brought in 80,000,
You'll want to file a complaint, but you'll have already signed.
They have a lot of money, a lot of files, yours for example, and they have time.
They can wait.
But when will we get the money?
I'm not the one who decides.
We need to talk about it, like we did with them.
The important thing is not to be in a hurry, otherwise it's lost in advance.
The secret to winning is being patient.
Long live Master Sosa!
Come on, let's go in the middle.
I love you.
When I arrived in Buenos Aires, I met an anesthetist.
I started drugging with him.
It's the only thing that calms me down.
I also think I like it.
Do you have any pictures?
- About what?
- From the time you were fat.
I'll never show them to you.
Too bad.
I think I'd like you, fat.
Don't you like me like that?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You're mean.
- Tell me something about you.
- About me?
- No...
- Why?
Because we're good here.
And I don't want it to change.
In San Justo, La Matanza region, Buenos Aires province, the parties declare that they are delegating powers in favour of Master Hector Sosa,
in order to be able to intervene in all judicial cases and, consequently, to receive the compensation obtained and to take the necessary steps.
In other words, you allow me to collect the money the insurer will pay.
It's my turn to sign.
You wanted me to dance to make fun of me.
- Not at all!
- Yes, I did.
See, I was right.
Look at your shoulders.
And here we go again for a ride.
Shall I pick you up tonight?
I'm on call until tomorrow.
- How do we do it?
- I'll call you.
Can you take him to the wrong place and put a way for him?
In box 12, you have to change the perf.
I'm here for a blood test.
Here's the order.
Talk to the other office.
Hello?
I'm locked up.
The door's locked, Doctor.
Here's a little reading.
It'll make you spend time.
- Is there a problem?
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.
- Leave me alone.
Calm down.
Don't complicate things.
Stay calm and everything will be fine.
Is there anyone else?
No.
You know what we're doing here?
Are you stupid or haven't you read the file?
Wait for me at the entrance.
Why did you get involved in this?
You know why we're here.
We sent you signs.
You still don't understand?
Let me out.
You're hurting me.
Where are you going?
I'll tell you when we're done.
Is that good?
Stop!
What's the matter with you?
What did they do to you?
Let me see.
Luján, let me look at you.
- Son of a bitch!
- Take me away from here.
How are you feeling?
Answer me, honey.
Forgive me, please.
Luján, forgive me.
Sit down, hang on.
Show me.
Open your mouth.
Son of a bitch...
I'll take this away from you.
Raise your arms.
- What?
- I'm hurting.
- Where?
- Everywhere.
Wait...
What?
Help me.
Please.
Here.
Prick in the vein.
I know how to do it, don't worry.
Look at me.
Thank you.
Forgive me, I beg you.
It's okay.
I love you.
Son of a bitch!
Don't touch her again!
Fucking shit!
Never again, can you hear me?
Never again!
Do you understand?
Did you hear me?
Answer me!
Fucking shit!
What happened?
Luján, let's go.
Wake up, come on.
Please, get up.
Listen to me, we don't have time.
We have to go.
- What's the matter with you?
- Get some clothes.
I'll explain.
Take that bag.
Let's go.
Wait, don't open.
Don't look outside.
We're gonna change our plan.
You're going back to the apartment.
You're locked up until I get back.
Don't pick up the phone.
Don't let me...
Luján, listen to me!
We don't have time to waste.
Listen to me!
Look at me.
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
Take the bag and get in.
Lock up and don't open to anyone until I get back.
Don't answer the calls.
I'll be right back.
I promise I'll come back.
- I beg you...
- Calm down.
I'll be right back, darling.
Look at this.
Look what you did.
You didn't miss it, tell me.
You got a little carried away.
Poor little...
Casal was looking for trouble, and he found them.
What is done, is done.
You even did me a favor.
But I don't want you to have any trouble with them.
- What do you want?
- Keep calm.
Untie him.
Let's talk.
Sit down.
You picked up all the files without warning me.
When you get the money, cash the check and bring me the money.
How much?
All of it, of course.
Take it as an investment.
That's not my money.
I can't solve all your problems.
I already offer you friendship and protection.
Isn't that enough for you?
Muñoz!
What's the matter?
Sosa has to deal with a delicate matter for me.
You're gonna go with him and stay with him, I want him to be safe.
- Come on.
- Take it easy.
By the way, Sosa...
This chair is for you.
Listen to me.
Villegas 1357, in front of the open ground.
If you get the money, you're free?
So, be very careful.
This is crazy.
Stay with me, I beg you.
We've seen more.
Take care of yourself.
I'm so scared...
Don't be afraid.
Trust me.
The address of the bank?
- Villegas 1357.
Indemnities in favour of the complainant, amounting to 580,000 pesos, will be paid in three cheques, written to the complainant's lawyer.
The rest is about the stakeholders, and then you have to sign.
Get down.
Sosa, you're finally here.
You got it all?
Small check...
It looks like the account is there.
The account is there.
It's okay.
530,000.
And 560,000.
There's 20,000 commissions.
The office is in a bad condition.
We'll start cleaning it, then we'll replace the furniture and bring in the painters.
What color would you like?
What color would you like for the office?
I don't know.
Why not a light color, to give an impression of space and prestige.
It was too dark, too heavy.
We'll see about it later.
We're done.
Here.
You're coming with us, Sosa.
Where?
We'll drop you off wherever you want.
Get in.
You'll tell me what color you chose.
I changed the locks.
I'll get the keys this afternoon, remind me to give you a game.
I've got a list of all the accidents this weekend.
Last night, a taxi hit two pedestrians on a sidewalk.
It was one of those messes!
Did you read the paper?
How much this week?
A lot, right?
This month, there's already more than 30 of them, a real carnage.
Do you know about the carbble?
The bus was full of cracks.
There's a dozen wounded and a couple killed.
Those assholes could fix the fence.
That's bullshit.
One of the injured is 60 per cent disabled.
We need that one.
You'll take care of it, Sosa.
What's wrong with him?
Did he lose his tongue or what?
You're fucked, Dog.
- Drive, did you hear that?
- We're waiting for Vitali.
- No, let's go!
- We're waiting for him, I tell you!
What the hell is he doing?
Start, at least!
Go to the corner, there he is.
The condition of the caisse...
- What happened?
Hurry up!
What happened?
I don't know.
It's a wreck!
No, not yet.
Sosa, are you okay?
Are you okay?
Can you hear me, love?
Don't move.
Don't touch him and put the necklace on him.
We have to get him out.
- My leg...
Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Don't move.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I'll put the necklace on him.
No time, help me get him out.
How are you feeling?
Don't close your eyes.
Look at me.
I'm fine.
The money... take the briefcase.
The briefcase...
He came very quickly.
- Too fast...
- The shock was violent.
Bring her the briefcase.
Don't get mad, stay calm.
Sit down.
- I have to look at it.
- We're getting out of here.
Let me look at him, Pico.
Where's the gun?
Give it to me.
Don't go out!
Pico, are you okay?
He's dead!
- Where's the car?
- Over there.
You okay?
Get in the car!
- Drive!
- I can't do it!
Don't brake, keep going!
Are you okay?
Look at me, open your eyes.
- What do I do?
- Make sure we're not followed.
Nobody's following us.
Look at me, are you okay?
Turn right.
You did the right thing.
- You okay?
- Yes.
Look at me.
How are you feeling?
- Thank you, Doctor.
- I love you, too.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, let's go.
Let go, forgive me!
I'm seeing a woman inside, and there's also a man.
He's covered in blood.
Blood on the abdomen and lumbar area.
We'll take care of the woman.
Ma'am!
Tell me what happened.
Here's the neck collar, I'll help you.
We can lift it, on three.
One, two, three...
I'm sorry, let it go!
