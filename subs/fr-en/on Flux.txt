Some call Bregna the ideal society.
Others, the summit of civilization.
But there are those who know.
The Goodchilds built Bregna to ensure a future for us.
They built the Reliquary, a memorial to remind us that we survived.
And walls, too, to protect us.
They say out there, nature has conquered the world.
But the real enemy is in us.
Mysterious sorrows haunt us.
People disappear, and the government denies these crimes.
The state provides for us, as long as we stay in our place.
We exchange his freedom for a golden cage.
But there are rebels who refuse this market, who fight a power that gags us, who fight in the name of the missing.
They call themselves the Monicans.
I'm one of them.
Handler.
Aeon.
This is your mission.
Sabate Goodchild's surveillance plant.
Your input will be detected, but the alarm will be disabled immediately.
Their surveillance system is our worst enemy.
As long as they see us, the Monicans remain targets.
It's your turn to blind them.
Each mission precipitates the fall of the Goodchild regime.
She's my daughter.
Did you see her?
She's been missing for two months.
Help me.
Say, do you recognize her?
She's been missing for two months.

Are you shopping, Una?
You don't know?
I'm celebrating an event.
My sister's finally having dinner at home!
For me and Claudius, it's a big night.
And this time, you'll even have time to sit down.
I just wanted to talk to you about it.
Aeon.
I may not be coming.
Don't look like that.
It's not that you can't come.
But why?
I thought you'd follow me for a long time.
We're dealing with problems differently.
That's right.
You deny them.
How can you say that?
She's my daughter.
I see the problems.
I can feel them.
And I'm trying to do something good about it.
- A life.
- This is a life?
There are beautiful things here.
Only one of you.
- I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.
Tonight.
Be careful.
And come back.

Could be Monicans.
Three suspects.
I.D.
Suspicious activity, suspected Monicans.
It's not that you can't come.
But why?
I always thought you'd follow me.
We're dealing with problems differently.
The world is like this, I'm trying to make it something beautiful.
You're early, Claudius.
But they're everywhere.
Our duty is to protect you.
This is the fate reserved for the Monicans.
She wasn't...
She wasn't a Monican.
I used to have a family.
I had a life.
I only have one mission.
Una.
Aeon.
Aeon, Una.
Aeon.
Come back.
I'm listening.
She'll see you.
Handler.
Aeon.
We have a mission.
The one you were waiting for.
Goodchild.
We have intelligence to infiltrate his guard.
We want you to eliminate him.
You should have called me earlier.
- Too suicidal.
- Not for me.
Patience, Aeon.
It took a year to get that information.
I know, you want to avenge Una.
But remember, it's over your head.
Other innocent people were killed.
Our time has come.
Our strength is real.
People are afraid of him, but if we guide them, they will support us after his fall.
I'm ready.
Tomorrow Goodwill will prepare his speech from the Council.
The presidential area is accessible only through the garden.
Cross it and quickly win the citadel.
His undergrounds are real mazes.
This implant will guide you.
Follow him.
I want Sithandra for the crossing.
All right.
Find the forum, President Goodchild will be there.
You know what you have to do.
Yes.
Do it, you'll get your revenge.
And we'll have our victory.
Hi, Sithandra.
- One day, I'll get you.
- Someday.
The transplants, are you okay?
Very practical.
Just do as I do.
I like pumps too much.
Be careful.
End of civil zone.

- Sithandra.
- Let's not stay here.
- Did you get the thing?
- That's right.
Avoid the grass.
- See you at 4:20.
- I'll be there.
I approve of the elimination of the real Monicans.
But don't go too far.
It's still too soft for them.
A certain leniency can serve our interests.
They must not taste the luxury of hope.
Force is not the only option.
But it's effective.
Against the Monicans, she won't be enough.
You want to find a compromise?
Negotiate?
We should review the law.
- And rewind.
- The law is not to be debated!
I'm debating it!
I encourage you to step back a little bit, Giroux.
Objectivity is in order here.
Your attack wasn't personal, was it?
The meeting is adjourned.
Oren?
I'm worried about you.
You're becoming radical.
These quarrels are hurting us.
I protect what we've created, and I'm proud of it.
It was to continue my research.
I'll fail if you don't control yourself.
- Got it.
- Sure?
Yes.
- What about the test results?
- All negative.
I'm sorry.
Find new volunteers.
Why don't you drop your tests?
We already have the solution.
Perfection.
- Be happy!
- You can see what's going on.
The situation is critical.
We can control her.
Control her.
You forget it was a temporary solution.
We believed him, why don't we change our mind?
It's immoral.
Everything changes.
Except you, I know.
You know me.
For a long time, brother.
Now we're in agreement.
Trevor, your speech.
Trevor...
None of this stuff.
- Destination.
- Forum.
Move forward.
Turn left.
I know that your fears and sorrows shake your faith, test your patience.
But more than ever, we must unite, for some of us are ready to destroy what we have built.
The Monicans want to divide us.
Let us never forget who we are, an isolated bastion, a tiny tribe.
But also the last descendants of the earth's peoples.
Together, let us adapt to these new challenges.
Remember, you've suffered, you've defeated.
We'll adapt.
We always adapt.
That's the fabric we're made of.
Katherine.
It's you.
Katherine.
Wait for me outside.
Aeon.
You said another name.
That's right, and you spared me.
Give me back my gun.
And let's see who wins.
Maybe later.
What was that name?
You know me, don't you?
No.
Do you know who you are?
- The one that was supposed to kill you.
- And ends up in jail.
But we're alive for a reason.
I don't know how to explain it, but it's good to see you again.
Amateurs.
Bravo, guys.
- Aeon.
- I'm busy right now.
Is it done?
Not yet.
Our information about him seems false.
I don't understand.
Let's go.
I hope you...
Don't argue.
I'll contact you soon.
You know what you're risking.
I know what I'm doing.
Fooled.
A Monican, against all our defenses?
We'll fix the problem.
It's Trevor and his famous security!
He must accept to be more traditional.
And agree to consult with us.
Once again, it was our opinion.
- I'm wondering about his motives.
- What do you mean?
Monican's trying to kill him, and he's letting her live?
That's weird.
Better, she's escaping.
Nice coincidence, isn't it?
How dare you criticize Trevor in front of me?
You have no right to judge him.
I'd worry if I were you.
The case is serious.
I should probably talk to him.
And you should be more careful.
Inari?
Image search launched.
What happened?
My spies swear Aeon is the best of the Monicans.
- She failed.
- It's the first time.
I wanted a clean job.
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.
In preparing the speech...
Tomorrow, 1:00.
I can't go back to you.
That's reassuring.
Everything worked.
- It was all about her.
- But she's retreated.
Why?
- I don't know.
- Checking the images in progress.
Arrange a second attack is risky.
The Monicans will feel the manipulation.
Stop.
Oren?
No.
That's impossible.
Claudius?
- Did you stay?
- It's more complicated than that.
We kill Una, and you work for her killers?
- What should I think?
- You don't know.
What more can I know?
They killed her.
- And you live.
- You killed her.
They thought she was a Monican.
- His life was worth more than that.
- I only had her.
You're not the only one.
Tell me why you're here, Claudius?
I'm working.
That's all I've got.
Work?
For Trevor Goodchild?
I accused him, too, before I innocented him.
Trevor wants to help us.
Something's wrong with us, Aeon.
All of us.
You're having some dreams, aren't you?
Do you ever see things you haven't been through?
Una made it.
Me too.
Soon, all Bregna will do it.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
We're told the strict minimum.
Humbly, I serve science.
- Who else?
- Trevor.
We're studying vegetation outside.
Defining the virus freed something else, which sprang to replace it.
We're sick.
And Trevor wants to heal us.
You know everything.
Trevor tried to drug me.
Tell me what's in it.
Message.
Well, read it.
You have to drink it.
It's the only way.
I loved her.
Never doubt it.
Aeon.
I'm sorry to hurt you, but talking to you freely is risky.
It's all just appearance.
You could kill me.
Why did you hesitate?
You know where to find me.
- Why am I here?
- I had to see you again.
You killed my sister.
I didn't know her.
I'm sorry.
- And that absolves you?
- No.
But it's war.
We're dying on both sides.
It's not fair.
It wasn't hers.
- No one's neutral.
- She was.
I'll kill you without that.
It would help you, admit it!
Everything changed when I saw you.
I know you.
And you know me.
But why?
Why?
Why did you come back?
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?
I want to find my sister.
Find the feeling of being human.
Aeon.
Why are you bothering me so much?
Katherine.
You know me.
You have to eliminate him.
Come back.
I'm not who you think I am.
Incomplete elements.
Variables identified in group 7 A tests.
Go to the 7B Reliquary and check the isolation of the variables.
Tomorrow, people will ask us for accounts.
I got you.
No sequence, president.
Leave us.
She ran away.
Why am I not surprised?
I caught him in the library.
- I hurt her, but...
- Did you shoot?
He's an agent Monican who's in charge of killing you.
Only one answer was required.
Freya, I want her alive.
Is that clear?
Did you let Oren know?
I can't find him.
Don't get away from me.
Despite what Trevor accomplished in the past, he is not untouchable.
He betrayed.
Oren?
Trevor has moved away from us over the years.
What we built here will survive him.
I never thought that would happen, but the facts are there.
He chose this Monican knowingly.
He must be dismissed.
Oren is his legitimate successor.
Isn't that right, Oren?
Right.
Case closed.
Mr. President.
Trevor betrayed us all.
He's a criminal.
And it will be treated as such.
...group 7 A tests.
Go to the 7B Reliquary and check the isolation of the variables.
Tomorrow, people will ask us for accounts.
Examine the evolution of Group B...
Sandrine Veems, Greta Salk, Una Flux.
Retrieve new data from the Reliquary.

Greta Salk, Una Flux.
Retrieve new data from the Reliquary.
8.26, 7. 19.
Collect new samples from the Reliquary 5.88 sequences.
You take your time to kill him.
The situation has changed.
Not our orders.
I decided not to obey.
Why are you doing this?
It all got complicated.
No, it's simple.
Trevor may not have murdered Una.
Trevor?
- I want to understand his role.
You were supposed to kill Goodchild, but you can't, or you don't want to.
Your gun!
- Have you ever learned to think?
- You taught me a lot more.
Please!
Don't make me shoot.
Don't you feel anything abnormal about yourself?
Sithandra, I am.
I don't know who I am anymore.
You feel it, too, admit it!
Follow me.
We'll finish the mission together.
I can't.
We used to laugh more.
How can I get rid of it?
Katherine.

Goodchild's still alive.
Aeon failed?
She let him live.
There's something between them.
Something intimate.
Explain yourself.
She sabotaged her mission.
I tried to stop her, she attacked me and abandoned me.
Are you safe?
If we want to.
We're here to pick you up.
Aeon Flux is now a fugitive.
It has betrayed the resistance and represents a threat.
She's allied with Goodchild, whom she joined.
We have to act quickly.
Eliminate her.
Kill her and finish her mission.
Show them where you are.
Are you picking me up?
- Perfectly.
- Yes.
Yes.
Release her and hurry.
Trevor?
That's her.
Yes.
- She came today.
- What was she looking for?
His sister.
Una.
Una Flux.

Camille Abdi.

Una Flux.
Test group 7B.
Killed by law enforcement.
Who ordered this?
Authorizations given by Oren Goodchild, Deputy President.
Go get my notes on group 7B at the lab.
You have to hide.
They're looking for you.
- RV over there in two hours.
- Where are you going?
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...
I'll meet you at the lab.
Be careful.
Una.
That's her.
- My baby, please!
- She's not afraid of anything.
You cloned her?
I cloned everyone.
A complication, related to the treatment of the industrial virus.
The vaccine had an unexpected side effect.
Sterility.
In a generation, our species would be extinct.
The situation was desperate.
We have the responsibility...
We never managed to clone a human.
We did.
When a man dies, his DNA is recycled.
Oren and I designed the Reliquary to store DNA and hide cloning.
The Guardian selects a couple. With dyes, you simulate a pregnancy.
When the woman comes for an examination, we implant her cloned embryo.
Nature does the rest.
Nine months after his death, a citizen was born again.
For seven generations, Oren and I have been cloned, re-educated, so that I can get treatment before we all die.
Is that what we are?
Pale copies?
We are much more.
It was a temporary solution.
I wanted to heal sterility.
Una belonged to one of the test groups.
Oren lied to me.
He said her test was negative, while she was pregnant.
He killed all the people in the group.
Including your sister.
He killed her because she was pregnant.
Una didn't know. Her baby would have been one of the first real newborns in 400 years.
Oren has changed.
He doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to go back, he doesn't want to go back.
He wants eternal life.
You expected it, didn't you?
Your loyalty to Trevor is no longer enough.
I remain loyal to other things, deeper.
I don't understand you and Trevor.
Your sentimentalism, your love of the past, of the past.
I couldn't live without them.
How can you?
Sasha!
Let's go.
Oren will soon find us.
She'll give you a job!
He wants us.
Run!
Down!
No time to faint.
Stay calm.
We have a technical problem.
Stay calm.
We have a technical problem.
Stay calm.
We have a technical problem.
No Monican hideout is safe.
Nothing's gonna be anymore.
We have to extract the bullets.
Are you touched somewhere else?
They didn't miss you!
Maybe we'll have to cross the wall.
I know.
But first, let's finish it.
I have to get my notes from Una's band.
Oren will find my lab and destroy everything I've done.
Soldiers, get back to your bases and wait for our instructions.
Who's in charge here?
We need help.
- Our orders are to kill you.
- It's a coup.
They come from an illegitimate power.
- Don't move!
- What's your name?
- Excuse me?
- Give me your name.
Ord. Garret Ord.
I can't give you orders anymore.
But neither do they.
You're free.
The decision is yours.
Kill us or help us, but quickly.
What's up, Lieutenant?
What do you need, president?
Weapons, to go back to the Citadel.
Good.
General alert.
Go home and wait for our instructions.
We'll keep you informed.
This is a message from the Council and President Oren Goodchild.
General alert.
Go home and wait for our instructions.
- We're almost there.
- Wait a minute.
Trevor.
That name that...
Katherine.
It was mine.
You were my wife.
We had a life, like everyone else.
Wait.
I need to know.
The disease took you away, you couldn't clone yourself.
I've lived seven lives since then.
Every time, I've "reaped" you.
Like an idea refusing to die.
You were a challenge to my imagination.
But when I saw you, my feelings were true.
I knew you.
I remember you.
Our feelings survived death, everything.
I was looking for you.
I've been waiting for you.
We were different people.
That's right.
They don't exist anymore.
But something of them remains.
Yes.
I remember.
It's chaos outside.
A coup against Goodchild.
I was able to sneak easily.
Do you have a way to find her?
Thanks to the pill residue, we can locate it.
No.
Freya.
It's all gone.
I had the formula.
I found the answer.
Everything's gone, everything.
Don't stay here.
One more thing to do.
The only thing to do is to leave these places.
Behind these walls, we will build a life.
I have one last thing to do, destroy all this.
No.
You're wrong.
There's no evidence that I'll find the formula.
- We only have cloning.
- That's not enough anymore.
Our minds are breaking apart, and every rebirth is worse.
Do it, and it's the end.
We all have to die.
That's what makes life meaningful.
Ours is torture.
We're just ghosts.
I don't feel that way.
Not now.
Prudence.
You know his reputation.
- It's a futile gesture.
- An act of faith.
It's not up to you to decide.
I don't want to lose you again.
No risk.
You'll find the formula.
It's over, Trevor.
Deploy on the south tower.
Your research is out of date.
Other women have become pregnant, of course, without testing.
More and more.
Healing.
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop that.
How much?
How much, Oren?
How important.
Nature has finally won.
- In position.
- In position.
Target in sight.
Nature is archaic, not us.
Do you not understand the beauty of our creation?
It's getting complicated.
You said she was dead,
We tried everything.
I had his DNA destroyed.
You had changed to her contact.
She would have made you forget your duty.
- Like she does today.
- You're wrong.
No.
- Ready.
- On my signal.
This world, our world, is beautiful.
We have to save him at all costs.
It can't last.
Everything's getting worse.
We're waiting for your signal.
- Sithandra.
- Shoot Flux first.
You're wrong.
We have defeated death and nature.
You're out of your league.
And bulky.
Wait.
Sithandra.
You chose.
It's too late.
You know how much we all suffer.
I'm trying to stop everything, like Trevor.
I would never betray you.
Help me.
Sithandra.
Don't forget who I am.
Kill her.
You can choose to trust.
Kill her.
Sorry, Oren.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, so am I.
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon and Goodchild.
Goodchild's hit.
Flux is heading towards the courtyard.
Cover Aeon.
Sithandra!
Oren.
They're coming.
Aeon.
We're waiting for your orders.
You didn't do anything.
In any case, we are not anarchists.
There must be rules.
Thank you.
It's you, isn't it?
You saved me.
Yes.
I used to know you.
This DNA has been altered.
Destroy him.
I knew how important you were.
His DNA is healthy.
Destroy him.
I knew I had to protect you.
I kept your DNA here, secretly, in the latent state.
I've been waiting for the time to bring you back to life.
Why?
I knew your strength would survive in you.
I thought if you came back, you could touch Trevor.
You've always had that power.
- We've got to get this over with.
- Yes.
And start all over again.
What about you?
I've been waiting 400 years for this day.
I'm tired.
Stay alive, Aeon.
We need you.
Look!
We can finally move forward, live once, but really live. Before giving way to others, who will make it better.
Katherine.
Will I ever see you again?
Live only once, but keep hope.
