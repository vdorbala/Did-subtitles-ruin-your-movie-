I'll tell you what.
If I lost my wife, and the next day, a bird would sit on the edge of my window, stare at me, and say, "Sean, it's me, Anna, I'm back."
What would I say?
I'd like to believe it.
And I would live with a bird.
Without that, certainly not.
I'm a science man.
I don't believe all these bastards.
That will be the last question.
I have to run before I go home.
Excuse me.
I forgot the ribbon.
I don't want to go up on my own.
I'll be a minute.
I met Anna at a party.
I called her and asked her to go out with me, but she said no.
And I called back.
It took a year for her to have dinner with me.
A year later, I asked him to marry me.
She said no.
A year later, I rested the question and she said no again.
Two weeks ago, she said, "Maybe."
Tonight, I'm glad to announce that she said, "Yes."
- How are you?
- Good.
I forgot the ribbon in the car.
I'll be a minute.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Can I give you a package?
- Make it a nice one.
It's been so long.
You did the right thing.
Congratulations.
I'm Joseph.
- This is Clifford.
Congratulations.
Nice speech.
I've heard a lot about you.
Clara's coming.
She forgot the ribbon.
For your present.
I'd better go wait for him.
Have a good night.
Certainly.
Thank you.
I loved your speech.
Wait a minute!
Let's swallow this thing.
- Bob, will you cut it?
- All right.
Where are the Drummonds?
They called to say they'd be late.
They'll be here for the cake.
All right.
Anna made up her mind.
Do you have a date?
- During our beautiful month of May.
- Wonderful.
- Joe, congratulations.
- Thank you, Bob.
I wanted to tell him.
It's my wedding.
I'm glad too.
That's good in May.
Nice and warm.
- Well done, Joseph.
- Thank you.
- You're coming to Eleanor's birthday?
- No, I'm coming to see Anna.
I used to take classes.
I'm sorry I stopped.
We'll serve the cake.
Sorry I'm late.
They're in the dining room.
There you go.
Can you hand him the knife?
Look at this!
I can't believe it.
Make a wish, Eleanor.
Laura and Anna are still close to me.
Happy birthday, Mother.
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'd like to see Anna.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Let's go to the kitchen.
I'll tell you.
Did you come here to make a joke to me?
He wants us to talk in private.
Do you see that?
What do you want?
You.
Do you want me?
Is that right?
You're my wife.
You mean we were married at some point in our lives?
Look, I'm going to marry Joseph.
He's a little older than you.
We have a little more in common.
If our ages had been better matched, we might have been able, who knows?
You're a lovely boy.
But I'm going to marry someone else.
It's me.
Sean.
You're pretending to be Sean?
Come on, come on.
You're going to make a serious mistake marrying Joseph.
Jimmy, do you know this kid?
Does he live in the building?
Put him in a cab and send him home.
You know how to take the subway?
You have nothing to do here.
Go away.
Well?
He claims to be Sean.
I get it.
His name is Sean.
That's right.
Jimmy said it, downstairs.
He said he didn't want me to marry Joseph.
He said I shouldn't marry you.
I'm gonna get the car out.
Hello.
- What's that?
- Someone dropped it off.
Your fiancé is here.
Hey, Anna.
Hey, Peter.
It's amazing.
Are you telling me this kid's trying to dissuade you from marrying Joseph?
What's amazing?
It's not so common for someone to pretend to be dead.
What's more, a little boy.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't mean to bother you.
But who is it?
Is he really pretending to be Sean, or is his name just Sean?
He said, "It's me, Sean." What do you want me to think?
I guess he tried to tell me he was Sean.
He's your late husband!
What is he?
Maybe it's true?
Lord, come and help me.
This is Jimmy.
Keep the castle.
Why did you think it would bother me?
Is that the case?
You could have shown it to me when you got it.
I didn't open it until I got to the office.
You weren't curious?
I didn't know who it was from.
Don't be an idiot.
Help me close my dress.
We're gonna be late.
I understand that a kid can fall in love with you.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
I'm dating my fiancé.
I love you.
We should ask Jimmy who he is.
Let's forget about it.
You're not interested?
It's probably a bad joke.
Hello, Jimmy.
It's Joseph at 1001.
A boy named Sean left a letter for Anna.
Jimmy's out.
Who's there?
I think your husband's in the lobby.
Are you alone?
My dad's upstairs.
Your father lives here?
Can I talk to him?
202.
My father is a teacher.
Good evening.
My name is Joseph.
I live above.
Is everything okay?
- I'd like to talk to his father.
- I'll get him.
What's the matter?
- Who are you?
Joseph, I live above.
Oh, yes.
What's going on?
Is there a problem?
I'd like to talk to you about your son.
I'll be right back.
202.
I want you to tell him you're not gonna bother him anymore.
I can't.
Tell him you won't bother him anymore.
- Right now.
- No.
- Tell him, Sean.
- I can't.
- Why did you write this?
- Why did you come into his house?
I had to talk to him.
Now you're gonna promise him you'll never bother him again.
- Sean, tell him.
- No.
- You're hurting me.
Sean, tell him you won't bother him anymore.
- I can't.
- Do you realize?
- Say it.
- I can't.
I don't want you to bother me anymore.
We're gonna be late.
Thank you.
That's what's done.
I don't know.
It's kind of funny.
Actually, it's not funny at all when you think about it.
He's really convinced that he's someone else.
This is ridiculous.
I don't know these people.
All I know is they have money.
He even wrote her a letter, telling her not to marry this guy.
Permission to turn off the light, Captain?
Permission to turn off the light?
Captain, the men are plotting.
They're talking about mutiny.
You're in command of this ship.
It's just a slight sea sickness, Captain.
I'm not your stupid son anymore.
Why don't you go and explain your delay at the director's?
Don't be an idiot.
Meet me at the park.
You know where.
I thought you and Joseph had to talk to him.
We did.
- Why is he calling home?
- I don't know.
What was the message?
He wanted you to meet him at the park.
And you'd know where.
That's what he said.
You think this is a game?
What's fun?
What if Bob comes to test me at my place?
- You know Bob?
- He was my brother-in-law.
If I answer his questions correctly, will you believe me?
Will you believe me?
Who told me Santa didn't exist?
I'll know when I see them.
You're just a little boy.
It's amazing.
It is.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
He knew where Sean died.
I'm tired.
Let's sleep.
We'll get it.
I'll record you.
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I'm not a therapist.
I'm just a general practitioner.
See, if you were really my brother-in-law, you'd say it's impossible for you to sit there in front of me.
You didn't believe in life after death at all.
You thought that only matter survives, and that the mind, the soul, calls it what you want, would disappear forever.
Ask your questions.
Where did you live?
In Anna's apartment today.
With Anna, you didn't have an apartment?
- No.
- Why?
I was often absent.
I worked a lot.
Where?
In different places.
Say one.
Your hospital.
I've been teaching there.
About what?
The fission of the atom.
Why do you and Laura no longer have an apartment?
- We have one.
- Why don't you live there?
- Tell me about Anna...
- You lost your job.
No, I didn't lose my job.
We're doing some work.
We're having a baby.
I thought she couldn't have one.
Let's just talk about Anna.
Tell me something personal.
We've been married 30 times.
That's a lot.
30 churches in 30 days.
Was it me, your witness?
- It was Clifford, my witness.
- Clifford was your witness.
Tell me something you can't have heard or found out.
We did this on your couch.
The green couch.
Look, you can think whatever you want.
They can all think what they want.
Talk to anyone you want.
It doesn't matter.
It's me, Sean, I love Anna, and we can't change anything.
Nothing.
Forever.
Thank you.
Would you like something to drink?
Yes, thank you.
Fruit juice?
- Apple juice.
- Please.
Remember me?
A little.
I've got you in my eye, don't bother them.
Would you like to come and sit down?
I'll say it...
I'll tell him right away.
You're not my sister's husband.
It's not him.
Let's start from this principle.
And from now on, we're gonna tell each other the truth.
No more lies.
Thanks, Lee.
You want some of my birthday cake?
He told me he was no longer my son.
Let him sleep here tonight.
I'm gonna break this spell.
I'll pick him up at school tomorrow night and I'll bring him back to you.
Don't touch that.
This is my office.
I was working here.
Remember me?
However, we were not introduced on the anniversary.
No.
Yes, it is.
And you know what my name is?
You know my name?
So, what do you know about me?
You're the one who told Anna that Santa didn't exist.
How do you know where Sean died?
Do you know the feeling of already-seen?
That's kind of it.
Where did Sean meet Anna?
Didn't she tell you?
Where did he know her?
We met at the beach.
Does Mr. Reincarnation enjoy the cake?
Looks like it.
Where's Anna?
The only reason she kept you here is to help you.
Don't make any illusions.
How do you know all this?
I'm Sean.
You won't get me.
I was surprised to see you at the party.
I didn't expect you to come.
I'm so sorry.
It's been so long.
So many memories.
I'm so sorry.
What?
It's nothing.
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.
I met...
I met someone who seems to be Sean.
What do you mean?
- What are you talking about?
- I know it sounds crazy, and I was the first to laugh, you can believe me.
You know how much I loved Sean.
So strong.
Of course.
If anyone knows, it's you.
I sent you a card.
For Christmas.
Did you get it?
It took me so long, I couldn't get it out of my head.
It had become too difficult for me.
And I met Joseph.
He loves me very sincerely.
And he faced my side.
He accepted all this without...
Without feeling in danger.
Because of him.
He's a ten-year-old boy.
What are you saying?
He's a child.
He told me his name was Sean.
I really hoped it was Sean.
I wanted him to be, but I knew it wasn't him.
This is insane.
It's insane, but I can't help it.
I don't see anything strange about this.
He came to our house.
He came to my mother's birthday party without being invited.
We thought he had arrived with the Drummonds.
Do you remember the Drummonds?
I'm so sorry.
He came with them, and he told me that he loved me and that he didn't want me to marry Joseph.
I thought, "This is ridiculous, this is a joke."
I told him to go home, and the next day he sent me a letter that said:
"Don't marry Joseph."
Normally, we'd think that...
Normally...
"This child must be treated."
I told him I didn't want to see him again, and then he... passed out.
And then it touched me.
I don't know how he knows so much about me.
Can I help you?
I don't want to fall back in love with Sean.
Do you understand?
And that's what's going on.
You have to come talk to her and tell her to leave.
All right.
Because I can't.
A husband must support his wife, feed her, defend her, take care of her.
How are you going to feed me, defend me, take care of me?
How will you do that?
I'll find a job.
How will you satisfy my desires?
I understand what you're talking about.
Are you ready?
Have you ever had sex with a girl?
You'll be the first.
It's my bus.
Look, I appreciate you loving me so much, but what you're imagining is nothing real.
One day, you'll meet someone your age and forget me.
I'll wait for him in the window.
- No answer?
- No.
- I'm bringing them in.
- I'm not here.
They have an appointment, too.
It's a five piece.
The kitchen's over here.
The mouldings and parquet floors are original.
I hope you didn't worry too much.
No, I'm fine.
If you don't mind, we'll listen to some music tonight and I'll tell her I'm getting married.
I'll take him back to you later.
Tell him I love him.
Goodbye.
What are you doing?
I'm looking at my wife.
I want you to go.
Stop it.
It's not funny.
It's not funny.
Anna, get out of the way!
Get out of the way.
- It's okay.
- Are you calmed down?
He has no experience of life.
When you pretend to be someone, you take care of the consequences.
That's the real problem.
I'm the one that should be respected, but that's not the case.
He was banging in my chair!
- Where are you going?
- Bob's.
I'll talk to him.
How are you?
It's okay.
Thank you.
Looks like we missed the show.
You're a little late.
Clara forgot the wine in the car.
She'll be here in a minute.
I need to talk to Clifford.
It's not Sean.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
See how dirty my hands are?
Show me the bathroom.
Come on.
Close the door.
Wipe them.
I moved.
My new address.
Don't tell Anna.
Let's go.
It's illegal.
Anna, look at me.
You're gonna go see him right now.
- Move over.
- Sit down!
You're gonna tell Sean to go.
If you don't, I'll call her mother, and she'll let the police know.
Do you understand?
Laura, get out of the way.
What are we gonna do?
We'll tell your mother everything's okay.
And then what?
I don't know yet, but I'm thinking about it.
You're not Sean.
Yes, it's me.
When you opened the door to me yesterday, I knew you weren't Sean.
Who are you?
I thought you said you were Sean.
I'm the one you love.
No, it's Anna.
No, it's me.
Anna is your wife.
If you were Sean... and I hoped you were... you would have come to see me first.
And I would have let you convince me.
But you didn't.
They're in your bag?
There they are.
Anna's love letters.
You can't go on with this little game.
- Hello, Clara.
How are you?
- Good.
What about you?
- Good.
- Have a good night.
- You too.
He gave them to me without opening them.
To prove to me that he loved me.
He couldn't leave her and I hated her for it.
When I heard she was going to remarry, I had us invited.
What a nice wedding present that her love letters.
I brought them.
In a package.
But I didn't have the courage.
And I changed my mind.
I'm sorry, but you're not him.
Excuse me.
Anna.
Your mother called.
Your sister just gave birth to a beautiful little girl.
Congratulations.
Maybe it's Sean.
- I think so.
- I know that.
I can't leave that boy.
Don't waste your time persuading me.
So what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what's best.
Go home and write him a farewell letter.
And go see Joseph tomorrow when you get out of the office.
Don't call him.
Go straight on.
Tell him you're sorry, that you made a mistake.
I can't.
As soon as Laura wakes up, I'll call you.
I can't.
You could get married at the beach house.
I married your father there.
You love the sea and it's beautiful in May.
Didn't you hear what I said?
What's your name?
Where's your mother?
Tell us where you live.
We'll take you home.
I can't do that.
Why?
I have to go tell Anna I'm not her husband.
I thought I was Sean, but I found out he was in love with another woman.
So it can't be me, because I love Anna.
No joke!
Central, we have a white child, about nine or ten years old, wearing a blue jacket, a black sweater and grey pants.
We're taking him to the station.
Hey!
Come back here!
He's back.
I called her mother.
She'll be right back.
He's taking a bath.
I have a plan.
We're both gonna run away.
You and me.
In 11 years, you'll be 21 years old.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Then we can get married.
I wonder what you'll look like.
I love you, Sean.
I'm not Sean.
I'm not Sean.
Because I'm in love with you.
That doesn't make any sense.
I can't tell you more.
You'll have to.
Can you give me a towel?
I have to get dressed.
My mom's coming soon.
You're a little liar.
That's it, isn't it?
A dirty little liar!
Is that right?
Is that what you are?
- Yes.
- Yes?
Did I hear you right?
Yes.
I walked all the way.
I thought you were my late husband.
I thought you were my late husband.
But you're just a little boy.
In my bathtub.
I never liked Sean.
What happened to me wasn't my fault.
I couldn't have reacted otherwise.
What I did was stronger than me.
Everything that happened to me wasn't my fault, and I can't be blamed.
I couldn't have told him...
"Go away."
I couldn't.
It was a mistake.
And I'm sorry.
But I want to live with you.
I want to live with you.
I assure you.
And I want to get married.
I want to have a good life and be happy.
That's all I want.
Be at peace.
Thank you.
Watch the thread.
Get in there, it'll be nice.
Lift your left foot.
Perfect.
Let's see the light.
Close your eyes.
Thank you.
Perfect.
Would you look at me, please?
Hold the bouquet.
That way, it's perfect.
Beautiful.
Look at me.
Beautiful.
Pick up the bouquet.
The bouquet, please.
Anna?
The bouquet, please.
All right.
Give me a nice smile.
Thank you for your letter.
Mom also thanks you.
I'm glad I'm back in school.
My friends don't know anything about what happened.
I didn't go back to your house.
And I see a therapist.
We talk a lot.
I hear I'm imagining things.
Mom thinks I may have been bewitched, but it's back in order, and that's the way it is.
Apologize to everyone for the harm I've done.
I beg your pardon for hurting you.
They haven't found what was wrong with me yet.
But they said it was good that nothing happened between us.
Well, maybe we'll end up in another life.
Sean.
