You think Mom's hot?
No.
Not really.
Why?
I don't know.
He's not my type.
Don't you think she's pretty?
Imagine it's not Mom.
Any opinion is subjective.
Maybe she's universally pretty.
I don't know.
It's not hot or cold.
You think people think she's hot?
People are fine at the McDo.
I'm going to the McDo.
And apparently, you think Mom's hot.
You've got a lot to do with it!
Did you get yourself an obese roadman to decompress before the little family trip?
Me too.
Shut up and get up, Elliot.
- Ben, who paid you that shit?
- Dad.
The part of the legs in the air must not have been terrible.
Belts.
Is it okay?
Action!
Where are we going?
Annapolis, Maryland.
And why?
Why are we going to Annapolis, Maryland?
Because my eldest son, your brother, is getting married.
What's his name?
Dylan.
Is his future wife from Annapolis?
Yes, absolutely.
What's her name?
Her name is Heather, Elliot.
And do you like that Heather Elliot?
She's adorable.
So Lynn, you have three sons, right?
And a girl.
Your sister Alice.
And this Alice, is she from a previous marriage or this one?
From a previous marriage.
And does this girl, Alice, live with you or your ex-husband?
She lives with us, Elliot.
And this Dylan, let's go back to him a little bit, does he also live with us?
It's not funny, Elliot.
I'm just trying to find out where your other kids reside.
I've had enough.
All right.
Maybe we'll come back later.
We're not coming back to anything later.
Let's go on, then.
Let's go on.
Is this girl Alice coming to the wedding?
Why are you doing this, Elliot?
To keep track.
Keep track of the journey, the wedding, those moments spent with the family.
I'm not interested.
To immortalize the event?
No.
How can you be sure these things happened?
What things did they exist?
Marriage!
And everything around her.
They must have hired a cameraman.
Probably, but I don't think he's digging enough.
You know what...
Be careful!
Damn it!
Turn off the fucking camera, Ben!
Turn it off!
Taylor says mom and dad paid the grandparents' house.
I don't want to hear a single word for 24 hours.
Like... for real?
You don't believe me?
I won't do you any more favors.
And God she was making you.
It's valid for you, too, Elliot.
Alice's coming in three days.
I beg you, don't make it any more difficult.
And ban on smoking.
Your grandfather already has a foot in the grave.
But not because of the cigarette.
Whatever!
Elliot, don't be surprised, during your last rehab, I said you were in Sweden.
In Sweden?
I don't fucking know anything about Sweden.
Shit!
- What happened?
- Dad's heart again.
Is he alive?
He's fine.
The helpers are looking at him.
Don't go, there's too many people already.
Dad!
You can say that his pacemaker is working.
He's stabilized.
- Mom, are you okay?
- Yeah, don't worry, does it feel good?
I don't understand.
He had a heart attack.
It wasn't a heart attack.
The Fentanyl deregulated his pacemaker.
His heart slowed down.
You're not taking him to the hospital?
Lynn, why don't you unpack?
Don't worry, his condition is stable.
He's fine.
He just needs some rest.
Ask his doctor for advice tomorrow.
But his vital functions are good.
I know.
Thank you so much for coming, Jason.
That's really nice.
Your wife finally gave birth?
Two more weeks.
Girls, your mother is an angel.
Flattering.
Thanks again.
Say...
If we mix it with Adderall and weigh 60 kilos, can we stay there?
When do we eat?
Be patient.
You okay, man?
You're all white.
Vitamin D deficiency. Did you read the article, Donna?
I'm not sick.
I don't like the sun.
Must be gothic.
I'm not gothic.
But you only dress in black, it's gothic.
He's gothic, isn't he?
Remember when Brandon lowered his pants and he was wearing pantyhose?
Dead of laughter!
I hope you've done it.
Between the fried chicken and the grilled chicken...
- To the food!
It's global warming.
The heat record, the warmest summer, dates back to the 1950s.
That doesn't make sense!
Since 1880, the average temperature of the globe has increased by 1.4° Fahrenheit.
He thinks he's Doogie Howser?
Doogie Howser is a surgeon.
I was tetanized when I saw the ambulance.
He's not that bad.
He just hates sitting there and doing nothing.
But he's a fighter.
He's seen worse.
Even with the rifle, you wouldn't finish it.
The doctor says his heart works 30%.
- But he's morale.
- Good.
It's the lack of oxygen!
I'd just like to tell everyone... that I'm the king of martini.
Wait till you see Heather's girlfriends.
Your dick's not gonna get over it.
It's a bomb.
My dick's not gonna get over it?
I swear to God, these girls are too good.
High-end.
Big-luxury pussy. Interesting.
I cut the bedo with coke.
Don't you mind?
It changes the two boxes of Actived that I swallowed last night.
What do you mean, Alice only arrives Friday?
- Alice's only coming on Friday.
- The rehearsal's on Saturday!
I know, Bonnie, everything's gonna be fine.
She can't.
She's got things to do.
And like that, Lee doesn't have to drive.
Lee's driving?
But he hates it.
Bonnie, please, I just got here.
Don't get mad.
I'm asking!
Can we avoid making a big deal of it?
I'm not making a big deal of it!
Ladies, make an effort!
Who said that again?
This guy, the cop... the black guy.
He's blind.
Who?
The dog.
Pinky Bones.
Thank God.
It's a gift from heaven!
If this clebs saw his clothes, he'd be immolating himself straight.
My mother drew them.
She's gonna open a shop.
That's what she says.
That's a good idea.
I support her.
Cliff clothes!
This is haute couture.
It's abused!
I always said it.
Lynn brings everything back to her, her family, her problems.
I know.
It's not about her, it's about Dylan.
It's her wedding.
He wants Alice to come to the wedding, right?
She made an appointment at a shrink's with Paul.
Who goes to the shrink to talk to his ex-husband?
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Elliot's doctor asked...
I'm telling you, no!
So no one in your family has ever suffered from depression, obsessive compulsive disorder...
No.
Where'd he come from, Mom?
From planet Mars?
Maybe.
But Dad's dad didn't have a problem with...
He wasn't an alcoholic?
Yes, but it was...
Is he dead?
Of course not.
You know, he...
What?
He shot himself.
Yes.
Excuse me, it's not nothing!
It was another time, the Great Depression.
Everyone committed suicide.
I didn't love Sweden.
It was super cold.
Really?
Even in June?
Maybe I had some popular ideas about Sweden.
That must have been it, it must have been psychosomatic.
I'm having panic attacks.
I'm taking medication.
We know!
...an unlimited vision of our intellect and what we are.
Our ancestors struggled, fought and died...
I can't believe it!
It's gonna be weird meeting Mom's ex-husband.
I didn't even see any pictures of him.
I do.
What's he like?
He looks like TJ, our former babysitter.
Paul wasn't... violent?
Yes, I think so.
Are you gonna break his face?
Well, why would I break his face?
I don't know, 'cause he hit Mom.
I also typed on Mom.
Come on.
Shit!
Alice, are you sure you feel the strength to come?
I'm just asking!
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'll talk to Paul very calmly.
I'm gonna do exactly what Dr. Marcus said.
Why would we fight?
It'll only be me and Paul and that shrink we saw on the website.
Don't worry, Alice.
Exactly.
That's what's planned.
Nothing more.
Fucking shit.
Dude, I have to sink a bronze!
Damn it.
Donna, go ask your dad what he wants for breakfast.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Let's go see what Grandpa wants.
Hello, honey.
What do you want for breakfast?
A big bowl of life.
We're dry.
Are you crying?
Are you sure?
What would you like?
Pancakes.
Well cooked, come on.
Who's my Pinky Kipu?
Say hello.
I think Dad cried.
He's watching The Fair Price?
It's their damn home defibrillator ad.
She always makes him cry.
Did he say what he wanted?
Delicious!
Pancakes.
Well cooked.
- Did you have lunch?
I have to get ready.
For what?
I'm going to see Paul.
I don't understand.
You don't understand what?
You're looking for a fight.
Why can't we have a good time?
You always move the knife in the wound.
What are you doing here?
- I was wearing a bronze.
A bronze.
A cartridge.
A caliber 22.
Take off the first two, you've got one left.
Like the number, commission number two?
Poop?
- What's wrong with you?
I know what you're suffering from, Ben!
I'm your mother.
Are these my genes?
Am I a bad mother?
Since you're talking about it, I've been thinking about it.
Elliot and I have problems.
I thought maybe it was Dad.
But Alice's fucking crazy, too.
- No big words.
- Excuse me.
But the only one that's normal is Dylan, and you didn't raise him.
At all.
I concluded that it must be you.
You're the only common denominator.
I love you so much.
Come and hug me.
Did you wash your hands?
Come on.
I'm going now.
Ben, can you bring this to your grandfather?
That baked pancake blubber took it two weeks ago.
All his life, he loved them golden and light.
Now he wants them blacker than the lady on the maple syrup.
You really are a girl from the South.
Don't tell anyone.
You're twice as old as civil rights.
- Pioche, Donna.
- I'm sorry.
Was Grandpa still crying?
I don't know, he wasn't there.
Taylor, go check the barn!
Grandpa?
- He's not here.
- That's too bad.
Dad, are you here?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hello, Lynn.
Dr. Stanwick.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey.
You look great.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- I didn't know...
Don't be silly.
Why wouldn't I be here?
You said it was a family crisis.
- I told Paul it was urgent.
- Exactly, let's sit down.
As Lynn explained to me, your son...
Our son.
Of course.
I get it.
Dylan and Alice are the kids you had with Paul.
Dylan asked Alice to be a witness at her wedding.
That's right?
Alice's going through a difficult time.
I thought it would be a good idea if Paul and I... addressed some of the issues before he got here.
Dad!
Where are you?
Why is it my fault?
I haven't seen my daughter in seven years and I don't know why.
- I didn't want that.
- Alice wanted this.
Alice or you?
You haven't done anything to make things right in seven years.
If that's the truth, I'll ask Alice to explain to me why.
I want to solve this problem and move on.
That's exactly what I want to stop you from doing.
Talk to his daughter?
You set me up?
You brought me here to ban me from talking to my own daughter at my son's wedding?
Maybe it's not up to you anymore.
And it scares you, Alice's a decision-maker.
That's right.
It's between me and Alice.
It's none of your business.
Patty, this story is absolutely none of your business.
I'm her mother-in-law.
She'd have to think of him as her father already!
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.
- I am.
No.
Being a father implies certain responsibilities.
- Be a mother, too.
- All right.
I understand that this is a painful question.
But let's not go astray.
I don't think Lynn's implying Alice's suffering because of you.
Maybe, but I should be able to talk to my daughter about what's going on in her life.
If my daughter goes through a self-destruction phase, I want to help her.
Wait.
- That's not what he said.
- Yes, exactly!
He didn't mean it.
I'm just trying to protect my daughter.
About what?
You!
- Why?
- I just explained it!
You take such pleasure in destroying this family!
Am I wrong?
Is that what you're talking about?
Is that what you're telling everyone?
That I wanted to go alone with my daughter and not raise my son?
Is that what you said when you cried on his shoulder?
You forgot the rest when you said, "Go away, Lynn.
"Go away and take Alice.
"But if you take Dylan, I'll take your two children off."
- What else did you miss?
And obviously, she doesn't know.
And I don't understand, I don't understand that.
I don't care what you understand.
What I know is that my daughter has been slitting her arms and legs in silence with a razor for six years.
A razor!
What don't you understand, selfish bastard?
What the hell are you doing here?
Don't talk like that.
This is the third time in a month.
I can't take it anymore.
Are you filming me?
You treat me like an animal.
Don't cover your face.
It's either that or the retirement home, it's up to you.
Go ahead, lift up.
I'm not an animal!
Heather's lovely.
She's had a lot of weight loss.
I saw Paul today.
Dad told me.
Well?
It went very well.
We're making progress, aren't we?
He's got a beautiful face!
Since when didn't you see him?
- Four months.
Six months?
I'm glad you're spending some time with your mom.
Patty insists I escort him to the ceremony.
Absolutely.
I understand very well.
You're my mother.
- With a dildo?
- No, listen.
I opened the door.
Elliot was there naked, naked like a worm, with lipstick.
What are you doing?
I'm making connections, but people are there.
Yes, Ben.
I noticed, thank you.
What are you doing, then?
Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.
Of course, Dad.
Don't you think the lawn's a little tall?
The gardeners are working well.
Don't worry about it.
It's my garden.
I should take care of it myself.
It's a good thing you don't have to.
You know Elliot didn't even say a word to me?
What?
He didn't even say hello to me.
Elliot's going through a difficult time.
17 is not an easy age.
I don't understand how hard his life is.
He's cute, you're rich, he goes to the best schools.
Of which he's being fired.
You're too lax.
You're not firm enough with him.
Don't hesitate to crack.
We're firm with him.
Elliot has a chemical imbalance in the brain.
He is depressive, obsessive compulsive, suffers from Tourette's syndrome, chronic anxieties and has difficulty controlling his emotions.
He's in analysis, and he's doing a lot better.
If you say so, honey.
Tiffany, how's your emotions coming back?
- Ready to play?
- Ready.
I'm going to start...
Having an operation for cancer or broken leg is expensive...
You see the girl Brandon's talking to?
Life closes on you, Dylan.
Heather's great.
You're gonna keep saying that in a loop?
It's not Peter Pan.
We can all applaud and say that we believe in it, but you're gonna hit Clochette your whole life.
Clochette is hot.
Clochette is tiny.
What are you doing tonight?
I don't know.
Maybe an express biture with grandpa.
Every flash in the news, we drop a juice of prunes.
The first one who shits lost.
I'm sure I'll win.
- You're gonna fuck up to death.
We've got a girl.
You should come.
I don't care, but I have to tell my mom.
We're gonna take off in about 20 minutes.
I'm going to shower, it's been a week.
Go take a shower.
Wash your hair.
Put on some lipstick.
What you usually do to be the most beautiful.
- It's more complicated than that.
You're gonna be hallucinating.
I'm fucking you.
That's not mean.
We're not judging you.
You're doing what you want.
- Who are you talking to?
- Your dad's.
I think I'm going out with Brandon tonight.
Lee, I'll call you back.
No.
It's 10:00.
So what?
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Why can't I go?
Because I'm saying it.
Brandon's five years older and you won't hang out with him.
What am I supposed to do?
Stay playing Rummikub with your barje family?
You could spend time with your grandfather.
This guy's a real zombie.
Don't be so mean.
Excuse me, but he's watching Fox News while he's sleeping.
This is the very definition of the word "zombie".
Did you drink?
Of course not.
Did you take drugs with Brandon?
No fucking way!
Don't lie to me, Elliot.
I'm not lying to you.
- Why are you being smart?
- I'm not being smart!
I swear to God, if you're back in the water, you're going back to Silver Hill right now.
I won't take any chances.
I didn't go back!
Stop being such a bitch!
Don't talk to me like that!
Stop accusing me when I didn't do anything.
Keep your voice down.
Why are you such a bitch?
What's your problem?
- Back off.
- Back off.
- I'm not doing anything.
Please, step back.
You Jewish shit!
Stop!
Jack, be skillful, be alive.
Jack, slip under the elastic.
At your bachelor party, we're gonna give up serious!
I'm sorry, I'm not cool.
- Did Elliot get away or what?
It scares me so much.
Doesn't that scare you?
Are you aware of that when it happens?
It's like we're pressing a button and something is tilting in me.
Where'd it come from?
Sometimes your reactions are so excessive.
It's not normal.
The minute I came in here, I had to lie.
Telling me I was in Sweden, trying to hide that I'm having fucking problems.
I can't escape.
I know.
They only see me in phases.
Unrepresentative phases.
And it's humiliating, because it sucks to grow.
They only see those moments, and they always pull them out of me.
That's because they have nothing else.
They don't know you.
You mean the only thing that unites us is the worst moments of life.
The humiliations we'd like to forget.
Everything we want to avoid.
You don't want Alice to come and face the trauma of her childhood.
You're trying to explain to them that it could be serious, but they don't understand.
They'll never understand.
So you're driving yourself crazy,
Alice's mutilating and I'm turning... into a dirty dream.
Are you going to tell Dad?
Yes, I have no choice.
- We're gonna dig in the corner?
But if we put it there, we don't have to...
Lynn Hellman.
Fred, man to do everything.
Can I help you?
If you have a solution to plant a 3.60-metre pole without piercing the irrigation system.
Did you just get up?
The tent may not be in the right position.
If we move it and turn it around...
We talked about it a long time with Dylan and Heather.
They would probably have liked your opinion a month ago.
But Fred and I have the situation in hand.
That's right.
I've been working with this little lady since...
- How long?
Oh, my God.
It's not rejuvenating me.
But you didn't take a wrinkle.
I'll never let you see me without my beauties.
And what a beautiful look!
You're a love.
I'm gonna be in trouble with Paul.
Pollen hurts my head.
I'm going home.
I'll share your suggestions with Heather and Dylan.
They'll appreciate it.
- I love your hat, Donna!
- Thank you.
How dare she come to us like this?
Heather's mother couldn't, she had a lupus.
A lupus?
It's chronic fatigue.
We all know why.
Either way, she can't do anything.
Poor Heather.
Paul's company set up the tent for free.
And where does she think she's going to gringe him?
With his Tarzan outfit!
I just woke up.
I slept very badly.
Don't be defensive.
Everybody don't care!
Do you think Alice wants to commit suicide?
Of course not.
But one day, she will?
No, Ben.
She's gonna be okay.
If you say so.
I assure you.
All right?
I was wondering...
You think autistic people know they're autistic?
Depends on the severity of their case, but most of the time, yes.
I know I have a mild Asperger syndrome, but I didn't think I was autistic.
You're not at all.
Did anyone say that?
Donna was talking to Bonnie and Grandma about it.
With you in the room?
They whispered so I wouldn't hear.
But I'm over-developed in hearing.
I hear things below 20 hertz.
I don't see why you have to take the whole dress back.
I'm just adding long sleeves.
It's not that bad, maybe not for you.
Excuse me?
I'm just saying Alice would like to fit in, not look like a big bandage.
You know what?
It's non-negotiable.
Don't get on your big horses.
No, I'm not.
Isn't that right?
That's great.
We're very impatient.
Joe, he's getting weaker.
I saw a show with singers... please!
What?
Paul?
She left for 20 minutes.
- I know!
That's it, Lynn.
I know.
When?
I want to kill you.
In that case, you'll have to come in.
I'll make you some coffee.
I'll see you both very soon.
Say hello to the girls for me.
Mom?
What did you just do?
Excuse me?
Did you invite them home?
Oh, my God!
You're doing it on purpose or you really don't understand?
What?
What I can feel.
All of a sudden, there was a raffut of all the devils.
All the sailors on board were dying.
I went out, climbed the stairs to the bridge to see what was going on.
And there was a woman on the deck.
I walked forward, looked at her, and suddenly, I realized... that it was...
Doris came to wait for me.
Grandpa?
Did he just die live?
We're not kidding about that.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to provoke...
Don't worry.
What happened?
- He looked super dead.
- Dad?
- It's okay.
- Yes, something happened, nothing happened.
Something happened.
We thought he was dead.
What did you do to him?
What were you doing with the camera?
He was talking about war...
Did you talk politics?
No, I didn't talk politics!
You don't know the word "punt"?
You know what, go to your room, I'm not six!
I don't have a room. It's not my house.
Last I heard, this house is in your name.
You're such an asshole.
I made a mistake.
- Out.
- I don't think so.
It's okay.
I'm leaving!
- You must be...
- Fuck you, Paul, that kid's a good kid.
Fuck you, Paul.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Anybody want some tea or coffee?
Make it pass, darling, it looks good.
- Paul loves it.
- Sounds delicious.
Wait till you see Alice.
She's beautiful.
And so lively!
Very smart.
I can't wait to have a conversation with her.
Even if Lynn thinks it's a bad idea, I didn't say that.
Good.
Then we agree.
I'm only making sure she doesn't arrive in an unstable environment.
It's a wedding.
A marriage is not unstable.
You don't seem to understand how fragile Alice is.
It's not your fault.
At all.
The mechanism of self-harm is very complex.
I think Alice is trying, or rather trying, to turn her emotional pain into something tangible, like physical pain.
I think we understand perfectly.
Usually, this type of behaviour is intended to attract attention.
Did I say something stupid?
It's become a fashion.
It's not a fashion.
- I think...
- I don't care what you think.
I'm just trying to explain to you what our daughter's going through.
And in his case, it's about taking control.
About what?
Everything in this child's life has escaped his control.
Our divorce, the fact that she was forced to spend summers with you, the fact that she grew up without her brother.
She had no control over anything.
But you do.
No, Mom, neither do I.
Tell me if I'm crazy.
Because honestly, I don't remember.
I'm making such a blockage that I don't know the truth of the fake anymore.
The day before I left, we were in the kitchen.
And you were yelling at me.
I think... you lost your keys.
Alice was clinging to my leg, and you were screaming.
You were yelling so loud.
And she was terrified.
She wasn't letting me go.
You took me by the collar and hit me in the face.
You took me by the collar and hit me in the face.
Tell me, Paul.
Did it really happen?
Yeah, it really happened.
It must be good to unload you with such weight.
Grandpa, do you know where my camera is?
No.
She's here.
I didn't sleep last night, as usual.
I kept thinking.
It was supposed to be 4:00 in the morning.
I've noticed some propensity to melodrama since we've been here.
I thought if we met for a funeral and not for a wedding, we'd all get along very well.
The big question is, why?
The only conclusion I've come to is that death is a stronger bond in a family than love.
Stunning, as a concept.
It's a shame to say something like that.
Really.
It may sound cynical, but...
Take September 11.
I know I was very young, but when I think about it,
This may be the only time in my life when I felt like a total osmosis with every member of the family.
As if a mysterious and impalpable bond had resurfaced.
I know he's still here.
I just find it weird that it takes a drama to wake him up.
Maybe that's the education you got.
I am the fruit of my experiences.
Do you know about Alice?
I hear it's serious.
It's really weird to do this.
So her dress will have sleeves?
That's disgusting.
I know.
Lynn says it's his generation's anorexia.
Everyone wants to be beautiful.
Your girlfriends do it?
Of course not.
It's not generational.
I didn't say that.
It's Lynn, I hope she's pretty.
- It doesn't matter.
- Why?
Lynn doesn't want to confront Alice with this "environment."
It's driving me crazy.
How can she do something like that?
- Do what?
Alice's not coming to the wedding.
Maybe it's a little hasty.
She thinks she's the navel of the world, like her mother.
Who said she wasn't coming?
- Donna said Lynn said it.
- Not at all!
Yes, you did.
How can she do that?
Don't come.
What?
How can she do that?
How can she ruin her brother's marriage?
What's your problem?
Who said she wasn't coming?
Tell him to stop his ridiculous melodrama.
It's not about her, it's about Heather and Dylan.
It's their party.
I know that!
She'll be here.
Who said it wasn't?
What's that supposed to do?
Someone said it!
You should have told her to call her father and settle this.
Now everything's ruined.
Hey, everybody.
Are you okay, Alice?
- How are you?
- It's okay.
- Are you all right?
You look good.
I'm not waiting for my turn.
- Thank you for being here.
What's up, everybody?
Here we go again for the introductions and the false-ass smiles.
In God's name, if he exists, can we go over to the table?
What about college?
Do you have a boyfriend?
I'm sure of it.
You're way too pretty.
Bonnie, it's summer.
Donna, will you pass me the meat?
No boyfriend?
There must be someone there.
- I can do it.
Don't let it go.
She can eat like everyone else.
You must have suitors.
You lost your keys.
You were yelling at me.
And Alice was clinging to my leg.
She wasn't letting me go.
You took me by the collar... shit, Alice.
I'm so sorry.
It was a bad idea.
Are you crying?
I found Alice very well with the family.
Yeah, Dylan and she kept making fun of the dog with her disguise.
The cowboy.
I don't know what to do about Paul.
It's not easy.
I don't know what he's got, Paul?
No.
The dog dressed as a cowboy.
Are you even listening to me?
I can't get over it.
Try it, Lee!
With his small revolver cases... his little leggings.
I bet Grandma's a psychopath.
Seriously, it deserves an investigation.
You should write your thesis on that.
You will call him in the heart of darkness 4.
It's too poetic as a thesis title, if you say so.
You're kidding with the drugs.
You're barely getting out of your fourth cure.
Weed isn't drugs.
It's like a teddy bear.
A lizard.
You're not taking anything else?
Seriously, Elliot, you scared us.
I promise you.
You want to open the self-destruction valves, Miss Mutilation?
That was really bad!
You were ravaged.
I got it.
I stopped the strong stuff.
I'm just taking normal junk for teens.
I see big spoons, little spoons,
big forks, dessert forks... but not a knife in sight!
Really?
The knives are gone.
Maybe Grandma's securing Grandpa's house.
Do they really think having access to a butter knife is a problem for me?
Are you kidding me?
It's clear they think so!
Grandma's already traded your disposable razor for a bucket of depilatory cream.
Send an ambulance to 9 Overlook Drive.
Don't touch him.
Yeah, he's still breathing.
Thank you.
Don't worry.
It's always like that.
Are you high?
What?
Did you take drugs?
What did you take?
Fentanyl.
What's that?
Like morphine, but 81 times more powerful.
Are you afraid to die?
Every second.
Every day.
It doesn't make sense.
I know.
How do you feel?
Your mother may not have told you, but I won't be at rehearsal.
I'll be in the hospital with your grandfather.
Where's Paul?
Why isn't he here?
What do I know?
Maybe he had an accident.
Shut up, you're exhausting me.
If you want.
Where's your sister?
Where's Alice?
Lee, will you go see Alice?
I'm going.
You could have put on a shirt.
- It's a shirt.
- No.
It's a sweatshirt.
What are you doing?
You ready?
What am I gonna tell him, Dad?
To whom?
To Paul.
What am I gonna tell him?
What are we gonna talk about?
I understand you're uncomfortable...
He'll probably ask you what you're doing and you'll tell him.
You'll return the question to him and you'll talk to him.
It's a rehearsal, not Camp David's chords.
Are you hot?
Absolutely.
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Me too.
You've grown so much!
- I want a hug too.
- Paul, are you okay?
We saw each other in the wind.
You may have forgotten, but it was intense.
If you don't mind, I'll take these two virgins and throw them away with my thoughts and opinions on the state of religion.
Nothing too puritan, rest assured!
I'm sorry, he's in trouble.
I can tell.
But you, not at all.
You've grown up, it's amazing.
I'm sorry I missed that.
Thank you for being here.
It's very important to everyone.
I barely recognized Charlie and Sam.
They've grown so big.
They often ask me why you don't live with us anymore.
Is that what they think?
They think I lived there?
- Why?
- It's not that clear.
It's kind of...
They were little, you were the big sister.
It's from the past, and it has to be.
And I hope everything is forgiven.
What about your studies?
Is that interesting?
That's interesting.
Child development.
So that means... you're gonna take care of babies, become a pediatrician?
Child development focuses on psychology.
Of course.
You got to hold this from your mother.
That's Lynn's mania.
The therapist.
And everything else.
It wasn't just his idea.
Is everyone here?
Let's go?
This way.
That's very good.
And each on its own.
This way, darling.
That was great.
Wonderful!
And now, if the groom is willing to accompany his mother...
You didn't tell him?
Tell me what, Lynn?
You think you can come back to his life like this?
She forced you to do this to me?
It's my mom, Patty.
Did you say that being a parent involved certain responsibilities?
I was the one driving him to school.
Who was lining him up, trying his back when he had a nightmare.
I was the one washing his clothes, not you!
I've always been there for him, not you.
Why don't we go out and get some fresh air?
Leave me alone.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
Believe me, she dug up the axe of war.
The axe of war, damn it!
Everything okay, Elliot?
I'm thinking about the symbolic range of my place in the car.
Here we go.
Welcome to the Hellmans, to the crazy kingdom Their explosive cocktail, you're going to feel it passing The first one who breaks a cable will end up on the front page
Too late to save this bunch of lions in cages No cop on earth will shut me up I break my chains, I pour out my hatred
Not a moron in this family hears my grief Lift your right hand and greet Sieg Heil for the Hellman Nation
Huge, Elliot!
Coming straight from NYC to Annapolis to set the fire.
Goddamn it!
Those chicks!
I've got the balls on fire, they're good.
Look at this one.
He's a fucking purebred!
I bet she sleeps in black satin.
I'd punch his subway ticket.
Me too.
You don't even know what you're talking about.
Yes, I know.
My mom's got a book on point G.
I've used it a lot of times.
It's driving them crazy.
You know why I'm sure you're beating us up?
Always say.
If your mom knew where her G-spot was, she wouldn't make dog costumes.
Well sent!
- Why are you laughing?
- He's got a pain in his balls.
Shut up!
You better dance with me tomorrow.
Dancing isn't really my thing.
You're dancing macarena.
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes.
You taught me, and you made sure.
Remember?
Do you know about my brother?
You know he's autistic?
We don't talk about it often.
Because if we talk too much to the mental idiot, he loses confidence in him and it sucks.
Am I right, Ben?
Samantha, you want a cigarette?
That would make you really hotter.
She's really a pain in the ass.
It's better to have a pale complexion.
- Is he okay?
- All right.
I don't know any better beer than this Michelob Ultra.
Almost without carbohydrates.
Interesting.
Is he all right?
They're made in Indiana.
It's really cheaper.
What was the GM contract for?
Not the cubic zirconium.
- I know.
- We don't care what the price is.
That's funny.
Most people believe that before rock'n'roll came, there was nothing else.
That's not true.
Most people forget a somewhat blurred period of maybe 3 or 4 years, where everything started to take shape.
We had Perry Como, Bill Haley, Pat Boone...
And we had people like Jill Corey.
I made you listen to this song,
Make Like a Bunny.
I'm gonna call my mom, see how it goes in the hospital.
Tell him we're praying for him.
Listen.
I think we got off on the wrong foot earlier.
I just wanted to tell you I missed you.
That we all missed you.
Your mother said you were in pain.
I didn't know what to expect.
I hope you're not disappointed.
Disappointed?
Why do you say that?
I'm sorry.
I'm not saying anything.
Dylan told me you gave him a promotion.
It's nice, he deserves it.
He did a good job, but he has to move on, just like you.
Thank you.
I had to take a break, but I'm trying to catch up and finish in September.
That's good.
I'm glad you found your way.
I love what I do.
I feel like I might have something to offer.
I know everyone thinks I don't understand everything.
Maybe it's true.
But I want to understand, really.
Thank you, Paul.
Don't hesitate to call me, if you want to talk when you don't feel good.
I don't want us to get out of touch again.
If you agree.
Yeah, I'd like that.
And maybe we could have lunch... for example.
And maybe... only the two of you.
She's my wife.
I know.
Excuse me... bartender.
Can I have three double doses of your best whiskey?
How old are you?
17 years old.
It's my family.
And this is hell.
Have mercy, damn it.
Alice's in tears in the parking lot.
Give me my bag.
Take the kids.
I have to pee.
Do you drink, like, often?
Only when I take opiates.
What I was saying was, like, my mom raised Dylan.
Not your mother.
And like, I'm not saying that to hurt you, it's just the truth.
And like, what I'm trying to say is that I find it quite disrespectful that your mother forced Dylan to choose her for the ceremony.
You want me to tell you something really funny?
Are you sure?
Looks like you're done.
Looks like you're done.
Excuse me?
Get out of here, Lynn.
Why?
Get out of the bathroom.
Finally!
I've been looking all over for you.
You'll never believe what Elliot told me.
He's super arrogant and besides, alcoholic and junkie.
He ordered three double doses of I don't know what, and like... he said he was mixing it with opiates.
- It disgusts me.
- This whole family disgusts me.
Me too.
I hate them.
Who was that?
She didn't even wash her hands.
God, can't you master your pitbull as a woman?
Elliot says Lynn says that when Dad met you, you were a stripper, whore and cocainoman.
- Really?
- Really?
Is that true?
Honey, that's ridiculous, promise me that's not true.
You son of a bitch!
You lying bastard!
What?
Did you tell your kids I was a stripper?
- Are you completely sick?
- Did you say that?
- Of course not.
- That's what Elliot said!
- He's a son of a bitch!
What an exemplary mother you are!
Elliot has Tourette syndrome.
You want me to swallow this?
You're doing everything you can to destroy our family!
Do I do anything to destroy your family?
Are you kidding me?
I didn't give him up.
You can fuck yourself.
Let go of her!
Goddamn it, let her go!
- You found a blowout!
- She's gone.
Come on.
Son of a bitch!
- You just insulted yourself, Mom.
- Shut up and fuck you.
- What's going on?
She jumped me to the throat.
- She strangled me.
- Patty attacked me.
- Really?
And that bastard, that bastard drinks and takes drugs.
Calm down.
I had a few drinks.
I was having an anxiety attack.
- Get in the car.
- Shut up!
- She's pissed off.
Furax, Ben?
Thanks for telling me.
I didn't notice.
It's closed.
Damn it!
Lee, open the car.
It can't be!
They should be even more complicated.
It's 00:13 and I'm for you live in front of Joe and Doris Baker's house in the heart of Queen Anne City.
A few moments ago, a demonic force nicknamed the Hellman family plunged this peaceful little town into the most absolute chaos.
Facing the elderly self-destructive girl,
Alice in the hands of money, and in the very inconvenient attitude of the two matriarchs, some wonder how the events of tomorrow will take place.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The preliminary reports suggest that whatever the outcome,
Doris Baker is and will remain animated by silent anger.
One question remains unanswered:
Will they forget their grievances for a day or will they unleash their lightnings before breaking up the family like a crab from Maryland?
It was Elliot Hellman live for Fuck News.
What's the name of the tea I like?
Which one?
The one I drink, green tea.
No, it's chamomile.
Why are you asking me?
I'm asking you for his name.
"Abandoned."
"Abandoned..." to sleep.
God, Lee, can't you just ask me?
I never light that lamp.
Can I talk to you?
Why didn't you ever learn to shut up when you had to?
I wanted to...
I know what you want.
We all know that.
You've never had the decency, respect or consideration to keep something for yourself.
I'm trying to fix things.
For who?
For me?
Who am I standing in the middle of the night without sleep?
I'm exhausted and I can't sleep.
Are you gonna fix it for me?
The doctor said his condition was stable.
He can't do anything more.
Except for his comfort.
That's what I've done my whole life.
Make sure it's comfortable.
I was 17 when I met your father, and he was so beautiful.
So big, so strong,
So shy.
I miss him.
I miss the man I married.
When he's here and when he's not here.
I was just wondering,
When did this happen?
When did he disappear?
When I first slept in a large cold bed,
In an empty house?
What did I do to deserve this?
What did I do wrong?
And I know it's coming soon.
Every time I wake up, before I even open my eyes, I listen... I listen if he breathes again.
But what am I gonna do... when I wake up and he doesn't breathe?
When there's nothing left but silence?
What am I gonna do?
There you go, Lynn.
You got me.
Is that why you came here?
I wasn't ready.
I'm still not.
Things don't change.
People don't change.
They don't count.
The important thing is you.
You can't let them tell you who you are or what you're capable of.
If you do, they'll win.
I'm not like you.
I can't bury everything.
Don't do it.
Their opinion must have no hold on you.
It's stronger than I am.
You're a full-fledged person.
And you're strong.
You're so strong, Alice.
When we were alone, both of us against each other,
You were my model.
You've always been my model.
If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you you're upsetting.
Extraordinary.
Marvelous, wonderful.
I'd appreciate it if you'd shut up for the next 24 hours.
Why?
You're taking drugs back and it's your fault Patty broke up.
That's right.
But we could move on, family.
I don't have the energy to move on.
- Shit.
- I'm not telling you.
Hat, understanding.
Dad, you never got drunk at my age?
Not with the frequency and enthusiasm with which you do it.
What about you, Mom?
Not a single little shoot in the '70s?
Do me a favor.
Go get high, go overdosing.
I'm giving up.
I'm giving up!
Great!
Seriously?
Not now.
May I?
That would be great.
Why are you always acting like a jerk?
What's the matter?
Your maid's dress?
You're so childish.
When are you going to decide to grow up?
When the end is near.
Look at me!
He sees a road sign with the drawing of a trumpet and he says to me:
"Why can't we play trumpet here?"
"That means you don't have the right to horn."
I'm raising my drink to Dylan and his lovely wife Heather.
I wish them a long and beautiful life together.
I would also like to thank Patty, my lovely wife, for having organized this reception and mounted this magnificent slideshow in the image of our family.
And finally, before I leave you, I want to thank Alice for coming for this happy event.
It's important for his brother and for the whole family.
Thank you, Alice.
I've always loved Marilyn Monroe, and it's a bad thing.
I told him:
"When you're on the front line, remember,
"I'm Marilyn Monroe and you're Joe DiMaggio.
"You'll look at me,
"I'll send you a kiss
"and you'll hit the ball with all your strength." And you know what?
It worked.
Let's say, most of the time.
Maybe you saw him today, when you got on the front line, I sent you a kiss.
I love you, Dylan, and I'm so glad you scored a point with Heather.
I know, deep in my heart, that you are made for each other.
I love you.
You want to come over and tell us about Dylan when he was a kid?
Come on, let's encourage him.
I'm Dylan's mother, Lynn.
I'm not good at speeches.
I don't have anecdotes to tell.
I didn't expect to speak.
I just want to say that I'm happy to share this moment in your life.
And I'm very happy for both of you.
Really.
I'm sorry I don't have any funny stories to tell.
But I know... I know I love you so much today.
I love you so much, Dylan.
You've become a great man.
And when I look at you, I'm so proud of you...
So proud of the man you've become.
That's all.
There's never a band in weddings again.
We had a fantastic orchestra.
Well, I think my daughter has a crush on you.
Alice, do you think we could say a word in private?
I'd rather not.
Just a second.
Quickly.
I got the message.
Like when you were little.
Copy that.
Lee, nice to see you again.
That was really great.
Mom, can I talk to you?
You don't have to tell me, tell you what?
I want to know why you weren't on my side.
You're my mother.
Why didn't you help me fight?
To keep Dylan?
For heaven's sake, it's Dylan's wedding.
Can't you stop?
Didn't you see Elliot?
Nobody knows where he is.
How are you, Grandpa?
But I have some gardening to do.
I agree.
I'd plow good, too, if that's what you're talking about.
That's not what I'm talking about.
We have to look where we're going.
It's dark around here.
He has nothing to lose.
He breaks up with his fiancée...
I don't know what to do.
It's very late and I don't know where Elliot is.
I'm starting to worry.
Where could he be?
We're gone.
- Aunt Lynn.
- What?
I can't swear it was Elliot, but I think I saw him floating on a buoy.
A buoy?
In the bay.
What?
Am I in the captain's office?
My sister-in-law's son is in the bay on a buoy.
