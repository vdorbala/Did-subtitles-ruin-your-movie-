Choosing life.
Pick a job.
Choose a career, a family.
Pick a fucking TV.
Choose a washing machine, a car, a CD player, an electric box opener.
Choosing health, a healthy diet, a dental mutual.
Choose fixed-rate loans.
Pick a small pavilion.
Choose your friends.
Choose his overwear and matching bag.
Choose a credit show from a choice of shitty fabrics.
Choosing to tinker on Sundays by wondering about his life.
Choose the sofa, the grueling TV games and get wasted with fast-food crap.
Tommy, get out of here!
Choose to rot in the hospice by pissing on it, in misery, by realizing that we shame the filthy ugly people we laid to replace us.
Choosing his future, his life.
But why would I do something like that?
I chose not to choose life.
I chose something else.
Why?
For no reason.
We don't need reasons when we have heroin.
Goldfinger is better than Dr. No.
And they're both better than Diamonds Are Forever.
The proof is that he made fewer entrances.
The one who broke all the records is Thunderball.
It's put on the back of misery, despair, death, all this shit, it's important, it's clear.
Fuck you!
This asshole's jealous.
But what they forget is pleasure.
They're all fucked up.
Idiot!
Otherwise, we wouldn't.
- You want me to do it to you?
- Yes.
It's as pure as snow.
After all, we're not stupid.
I mean, not that stupid.
Take the best orgasm of your life, multiply it by a thousand and you are still far from it.
It's better than pulling a shot.
And that any fucking dick.
When you're a junkie, you only have one problem: finding dope.
When you pick up, you take your head off with a lot of stuff.
No money, no cooking.
Money, you're drinking too much.
No chicks, you don't fuck.
You have one, it's stories.
You have to take care of the bills, the food, a football team that never wins, human relations, and everything that doesn't matter when you really give yourself up.
I'd say at the time, he was a concrete actor.
The presence of a guy like Cooper or Lancaster with a mischievous side that makes him a great young first, closer to Cary Grant.
The only downside, or at least the main downside, is that we have to bear a lot of assholes who say:
This shit in my blood?
Those fucking chemicals.
Never.
You're ruining your life, man, poisoning yourself with this shit.
All the chances you've had, you've fucked them up.
With that filth in your veins.
From time to time, I have spoken the magic words myself.
Never again, Swanney.
I'm picking up.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- I'll never touch that shit again.
- Whatever you say.
I'll make it this time.
I'm quitting for good.
- I've heard that before.
- Sick Boy's method.
- We can see what it's been like.
- He's always had a lack of will.
- He's a fan of Sean Connery.
- You're talking about a substitute.
You need a last shot.
- No, I don't think so.
- For the long night that awaits you.
He was called the Mother Superior because he's the oldest of us.
Of course, I made one last shot.
I had work to do.
Weaning.
Step one: preparations.
Plan a room we can't get out of.
Soft music.
Ten cans of tomato soup.
Eight cans of mushrooms soup, to eat cold.
A big pot of vanilla ice cream.
A bottle of magnesia milk.
Paracetamol, mouth bath, vitamins, mineral water, Lucozade, porn.
A mattress.
A bucket for the urine, one for the stool and one for the vomit.
A TV and a bottle of Valium that I have already taken from my mother, who is also a drug addict, but in a way deemed not reprehensible by society.
I'm ready.
I need a final shot, to alleviate the pain while waiting for the effects of Valium.
Mikey.
Yeah, it's Mark Renton.
I was wondering if you could help me.
Nothing surprising about Mikey Forrester.
What is it?
Normally, I didn't do business with that asshole, but nothing was normal.
Opium suppos.
Perfect for what you got.
Slow diffusion ideal for gently picking up.
Perfectly adapted to your needs.
I want a fucking shoot.
That's all I got.
Take it or leave it.
You're feeling better, aren't you?
You know, I'd better get them in my ass.
Heroin constipates.
The heroin of my last shoot is dissipating, and they're supposed to melt.
I'm not constipated anymore.
I dream of spacious and pristine toilets, golden taps, virgin white marble, a seat carved in the ebony a tank full of Chanel No. 5, and a larbin to tender me sheets of silk toilet paper.
But under the circumstances, I'll do it anywhere.
Damn it.
A fucking gift from heaven.
And now I'm ready.
The drawback: to know that I should associate with my friends in a state of perfect lucidity.
It was awful.
They made me think so much of myself, I could barely look at them.
Take Sick Boy, for example.
He stopped at the same time as me, not because he wanted to, but to piss me off.
Just to prove to me that he would succeed easily and devalue my efforts.
A hell of a bitch, don't you think?
I just wanted to lie down and feel sorry for my fate, and he insisted on taking up his universal theory of life.
It is a phenomenon present in all social circles.
What?
At one point you have it, then you lose it and it's over for good, in all social circles.
Georgie Best, for example, got it, but he lost it.
Or David Bowie or Lou Reed.
Lou Reed did some pretty good solo stuff.
Yeah, not bad, but not bad anyway, huh?
Deep down, you know that even if it's not bad, it's shit.
Who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.
What's your point?
I'm trying to make you understand that his role in The Name of the Rose is just a burst in the middle of a free fall career.
What about The Untouchables?
Bad, in my opinion.
Despite the Oscar?
It doesn't mean anything.
It is a vote of solidarity.
We're all getting old, we're cracking, and we're done?
Yeah.
Is that your theory?
Yeah.
Fucking, beautifully illustrated.
Drop the gun.
Give me the gun.
See the beast?
You got it in your field of vision?
Very clearly, Miss Moneypenny.
This should not be a major problem.
For a vegetarian, Rents, you're aiming like a chef.
Without heroin, I tried to lead a fulfilling life as a good citizen.
- Good luck, Spud.
- Thank you.
Think about it, if they think you're not making any effort, you're screwed.
And then they'll go to the ASSEDICs and say, "He's a pain in the ass."
- And you won't get your check anymore.
- All right.
- But if you do too much...
- You could get the job.
- Exactly.
- The horror.
You're on the steep rope, Spud.
It's a mess.
I'm intimidated when I'm in front of them.
I'm losing my temper, I can't answer the questions, like a football player, I'm losing my temper.
Try this.
A little speed, that's what you need.
No, I went to Craigie, Craignewton.
I put in Royal Edinburgh College to get the job.
There's too much discrimination.
They're all schools, after all.
We've all done the same thing and the important thing is, it's the general idea, not the details.
We're obsessed with details.
What school did I go to?
How many options did I have?
Maybe six or zero.
It doesn't matter.
The important thing is, I'm here.
Mr. Murphy, did you add to your resume?
No!
I mean, I do.
Just to get in.
I have shown initiative.
The ANPE sent you here.
You didn't have to "enter."
That's cool.
You're the boss.
You're the one in the chair.
I'm here.
I mean, I'm here.
Mr. Murphy, what do you like about the leisure industry?
In a word, pleasure.
The pleasure that others' leisure gives me.
What do you think are your weaknesses?
Yeah, I'm a little too perfectionist.
That's right, yeah.
I'm looking for perfection, nothing less.
If it's too limited, it's okay, I'll drop it.
But now, this interview, I can feel it.
It's pretty good, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.
We'll contact you again.
I'd love to, guys.
Spud got away with it, I was proud of him.
He'd screwed himself up in beauty.
You should've recognized him.
Imagine the scene:
Last week at Volley.
Me and Tommy, we're making a pool.
I play like Paul Newman, by the way.
I'm kicking him in his life.
We come to the end, the last shot, the decisive ball of the tournament.
I'm playing black, he's sitting in the corner, looking disgusted, when that big killer comes back, apparently happy with him.
He looks at me, the guy, he looks right in my eyes, like, "Come and fight."
You know me.
I'm not the kind of guy looking for shit, but in the end, I'm the one holding the billiard tail and he can get a shot in his face whenever he wants, you know.
So I'm getting ready, quiet.
And what does the killer do?
The so-called killer shits himself, puts down his bucket, turns around and breaks the pub, and then I win my game.
And that's it?
It was Begbie's story.
At least his version of the story.
A few days later, Tommy told me the truth.
Tommy was always telling the truth.
It was one of his major weaknesses.
He wasn't lying, he wasn't drugging, and he never cheated anyone.
It was Wednesday morning.
We were playing pool at Volley, that's right.
But Begbie really plays like a handle.
He's got a hangover and can barely hold his tail, not to mention a ball.
I'm doing my best to lose, to please him.
But it's no use.
As soon as I touch a ball, I put it in a hole.
As soon as Begbie approaches the table, he screws up.
Fucking shit.
Then he's pissed off.
Finally, I can do everything I can to make sure that he just has to put on the black one to win a game, to keep a little of his pride, and to make sure he doesn't stick one to me.
He's playing black, he's hitting her.
And it doesn't work at all.
Damn it!
He sees a little binoclard at the bar, and he accuses him of deconcentrating him by looking at him.
The poor guy didn't even take a look at us.
Fuck you!
He was gonna hit him, I swear.
After that, I thought he was gonna go after me.
The Beggar is a freak.
But he's a buddy.
What can we do about it?
Can you lend it to me?
What could we do?
Begbie didn't do drugs.
He was getting high at people, it was his trip.
That was what he was addicted to.
The lady had a drink on her face, no one's going out until we know who she is.
Who are you, asshole?
- Lizzy, it's okay.
- I'm playing.
While I was watching this intimate and so personal film, stolen a few hours before from one of my best friends, I realized that I was missing something important.
- I read it in Cosmopolitan.
- It's an interesting theory.
A nightmare.
I'm dreaming of shooting, but watching him suffer is so funny.
You should try it with Tommy.
And remove the only pleasure he gives me?
What about my birthday?
- What happened?
- That son of a bitch forgot.
What are you talking about?
Football.
What are you talking about?
Shopping.
The situation was becoming critical.
Renton noticed the haste with which those who succeeded in the sexual field, and in others, were insolating failures.
The heroine had stolen her libido from Renton, but she came back twice as fast.
His past impotence faded from his memory, and a sinister despair took hold of his obsessed mind.
His post-heroine libido, animated by alcohol and amphetamines, harassed him without remorse with his own frustrated desire.
Three small points.
Mark Renton also fell in love.
I don't want to harass you, but I was very impressed with the efficiency and class with which you handled this.
I thought, "This girl is different."
Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Diane.
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.
- Where is it?
- Where I live.
Great.
What?
I can walk you home, but I promise you nothing.
Does this usually work?
Or is this the first time you've tested it?
You don't usually talk to girls, do you?
Actually, you're a sensitive, calm guy, but if I'm ready to try it, I'll be able to really know you:
Smart, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal.
Taxi!
A little crazy, a little bad.
But, hey, girls love that, huh?
What's the matter with you?
Did you lose your tongue?
I forgot something...
Are you going up or not?
Do you understand?
I want you to be attentive and considerate.
- Generous but firm.
- What?
If you don't respond to these very reasonable requests, we'll immediately return to a situation of sexual abstinence.
All right?
- What?
- Shut up!
Wake up, Spud.
Wake up.
We're pulling a shot.
For hygiene.
Tommy, put on the tape.
Now?
I want to watch us while we're fucking.
Let's see what I'm missing.
Not much.
And the captain, Archie Gemmill, pick up the ball in touch.
I think he wants to go alone.
I'm sure he'll score.
He's going through the field.
He's scoring!
What a beautiful goal!
Gemmill's at his peak.
What a nice penetration!
I haven't taken such a foot since Gemmill's goal against Holland in 1978.
Yeah.
You don't sleep here.
- What?
- Out.
Come on.
Don't argue.
You can sleep on the entrance couch or go home.
And don't make any noise.
Damn it.
What do you mean, "She's gone"?
Where is she, Tommy?
She must be around here.
- I may have made it by mistake.
- Made it?
To your video club, Tommy?
Your fucking video club?
All the frustrated people in Edinburgh are jerking off in front of our movie?
Shit, Tommy, I want to puke.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Come in and sit down.
Coffee?
Yes.
- You're Mark.
- Yeah, it's me.
- Are you a friend of Diane's?
- More like a friend of a friend.
All right.
Are you his roommates?
His roommates?
I'll have to remember.
Hello.
- Hello, Spud.
- Hello, Gail.
Mr. Houston.
Mrs. Houston.
Hello, Spud.
Sit down and have breakfast.
Sorry about yesterday, by the way.
It's okay.
I slept well on the couch.
I had a little too much to drink, I had a little accident.
Don't worry.
It happens.
A man needs to get loose from time to time.
Rather, it should be chained from time to time.
- I'll put the sheets in the machine.
- No, I'll wash them.
- You don't have to.
- I don't mind.
Neither do I.
- I'd rather take care of it.
- Really, I don't mind.
- Really, no!
- Spud, these are my sheets.
- I don't see why.
- Because it's illegal.
- Hold your hand?
- No, not that.
Then you can do it.
You were happy to do more last night.
That's what's illegal.
You know, guys like me, in the hole, we cut their balls off and throw them away.
- Calm down.
You're not going to jail.
- It's easy for you to say that.
- Can I see you again?
- Probably not.
If you don't, I'll go tell the police.
Then we'll see each other again.
Now what?
We're gonna walk.
- What?
- We're gonna walk.
- Where?
- There.
Are you serious?
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, Tommy.
It's not natural.
It's the big air.
Fresh air.
Tommy, we know you're screwing Lizzy, but you don't have to take revenge on us.
- You're not proud of being Scottish?
- It sucks to be Scottish.
We're the worst of the worst.
The waste of humanity.
The filthiest, wretched, servile, pathetic garbage that has been shitted since the earth existed.
Some people hate the English, I don't.
They're just jerks.
We, on the other hand, are colonized by wankers.
We didn't even find a proper culture to colonize us.
We're run by incapacitated assholes.
That's not great, anyway, Tommy.
And all the fresh air in the world will change nothing else.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's me.
I liked the idea.
At that time, Spud, Sick Boy and I made the sensible and democratic decision to take back heroin as soon as possible.
It took about 12 hours.
It sounds easy, but it's not.
You might think it's the easy way, but living like this is full time.
Ursula Andress, the James Bond girl par excellence.
That's what everyone says.
The incarnation of his superiority over us.
Magnificent, exotic, very sensual, but untouchable to anyone other than him.
Shit.
Let's be honest, if she was banging a guy from Edinburgh, she'd be banging everyone.
I knew he'd do that.
Lizzy's gone, Mark.
She left and dropped me.
It's because of the tape.
Iggy Pop's story and a lot of other bullshit.
She pissed me off and it's very clear.
I told him:
"Is there a chance we can get back together?"
But there's no way.
Honor Blackman, alias Pussy Galore, right?
That's a bad name.
I wouldn't even touch her with your dick.
I want to try, Mark.
You always talk about what it feels like, the supreme shoot.
It's better than sex.
Come on, I'm a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.
I've got money.
Personality is what counts, isn't it?
Personality is what makes a relationship last for years.
Like heroin.
I mean, heroin has a fucking personality.
Swanney taught us to love and respect social security, the source of part of our stock.
We were stealing or buying drugs, prescriptions, which we sold, traded, manufactured, photocopied.
We were bartering with cancer patients, alcoholics, pensioners, AIDS sufferers, epileptics, depressive wives.
Morphine, diamorphine, cyclizine, codeine, temazepam nitrozepam, phenobarbitone, amytal sodium, dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocin buprenorphine, dextromoramide, chlormethiazole were taken.
The street is full of drugs against misery and pain and we took them all.
We would have injected vitamin C, if it had been illegal.
Excuse me, may I use your bathroom?
Thank you.
Stop it, you crazy son of a bitch.
Rent.
No heroin.
But the good times could not last forever.
Allison must have been screaming all day, but we didn't hit.
She could've even yelled for a week.
I haven't heard anyone in days.
Someone must have been talking all this time.
Damn it, that's for sure.
- Allison!
- Help me, please.
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Nothing could be further from reality.
In fact, nothing was going to go well.
On the contrary, everything was going to go wrong.
Everything would be even worse than before.
Damn it!
Oh, no, damn it!
Shit!
Please!
He wasn't my baby.
Little Dawn wasn't mine.
Spud's, Swanney's, Sick Boy's, I don't know.
Maybe Allison knew it, maybe not.
I wanted to find something to say.
Something compassionate.
Something human.
Say something, Mark.
Say something, damn it.
I'm making a shoot.
Get us a shot, Rents.
I need a fix.
And she did, I could understand, to remove the pain.
I made my kitchen and she shot herself.
But only after me, of course.
At least we knew who the father was now.
It's not just the baby that's dead.
Sick Boy lost something in him that never came back.
He had no theory that could explain such a moment.
Neither do I.
Our reaction was to keep screwing everything up.
Accumulate misfortune, heat it in a spoon with bile.
Then inject it into a purulent vein and start over.
Continue, get up, get out, steal, loot, piss people off.
Go ahead and dream of the day when everything was going to screw up for good.
Because no matter how much you gather, or how much you steal, you never have enough.
It doesn't matter how many times we go out and steal and piss the world off, we always have to get up and start again.
Someday, that kind of thing had to happen.
Shoplifting is a crime and whatever you think, there's no crime without a victim.
Drug use can explain your actions but not excuse them.
Mr. Murphy, you're a recidivist thief, with no regrets or remorse.
I sentence you to six months in prison.
My only concern is to see you too quickly.
Mr. Renton, I know you started a detoxification treatment to wean you heroin.
The suspension of your conviction is subject to your full cooperation during this period.
If you have to go back to this court, I will not hesitate to cancel your stay.
Thank you, Your Honor.
With God's help, I will overcome this terrible affliction.
What to say?
Begbie knew how to find the words.
Obviously, that asshole wanted to fuck a guy.
I hope you understood the lesson.
Son, I thought I was gonna lose you.
You only cause me trouble, but I still love you.
You better get your hands on yourself, buddy.
Get rid of this shit.
Listen to Francis, Mark.
He's right.
Oh, yes.
You wouldn't last two days in jail.
It's better than the syringe, Rents.
Choose life.
I remember when you were a baby.
"joli torment
"Mother's baby the pretty torment"
Sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
It's not fair, Spud in jail and I'm not.
It's not our fault.
Your kid's in the hole because he was a junkie.
If it's not your fault, whose fault is it?
When I think I tried to get him arrested.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
I wish I'd gone instead of Spud.
I was there, surrounded by my family and my so-called buddies, and I had never felt so lonely in my life.
Being on provisional release, I had to follow a cure, the drug sponsored by the state, three doses of methadone fadasse instead of heroin.
But that's never enough.
At that time, it's far from being enough.
I took all three in the morning.
I'm sweating my back, it looks like a layer of frost.
I have to go to the Mother Superior for a fix.
One fucking fix, to make this long and hard day go by.
- What's on the menu tonight?
- Your favorite dish.
Excellent.
- The usual table, sir?
- Thank you.
Would you like to pay the bill in advance?
No, put it on my account.
I must inform you that your credit was exceeded a while ago.
In that case...
Cash is perfect.
We're never too careful with people like you.
Would you like an entrance?
An appetizer, maybe?
No, thank you.
I'll go straight to the hard intravenous drug injection.
As you wish.
Sir may want me to call him a cab.
Open your eyes.
Wake up.
Come on.
I don't feel sick yet, but I'm sure it'll be soon.
I'm in hell with the junkies.
Too sick to sleep.
Too tired to stay awake.
The evil is on.
Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and lack.
A feeling of intense lack is going to grab me.
She's coming.
"Oh, you have green eyes Oh, you have blue eyes
"Oh, you have gray eyes
"And I've never met anyone like you
"No, I've never met anyone like you"
We'll help you, son.
You're gonna stay with us until you get better.
We're gonna be okay together.
Maybe I should go back to the clinic.
No!
No clinic.
No methadone.
It didn't work out, you said it yourself.
You lied to us, your parents.
- Give me some Temazepam.
- No!
Weaning is worse than heroin.
- Nothing!
- You're not taking anything anymore.
You stay here, so we can watch you.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I still need an injection.
Bring me one last fix, please.
I want a last shot, damn it.
Fuck you.
Shit.
We're having a good time, aren't we?
Sue to get rid of your body and if I come back and there's any more, I'll kick it out.
Seen.
Shit!
Question number one:
Is the human immunodeficiency virus one?
- Retrovirus?
- Retrovirus, good answer.
We're still getting screwed, Mrs. Renton.
I'm not saying I'm not wrong, far from it, but there's a time when we have to turn our backs on this bullshit and say no.
Say no.
God, she's dead.
Question number two:
HIV attaches to which lymphocyte receptor?
What receiver?
CD4.
CD4, right answer.
Better than sex, Rent.
The supreme shoot.
I'm a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.
It's okay, I found out.
Tommy.
No!
Is he guilty or not guilty?
He's our son.
No!
Dawn!
Stop!
No!
No!
Don't do this to me!
No!
Mark.
There's something you need to do.
The 35th, ornithorync.
The 66, sausage.
Mark, you got a full box.
Damn it, Mark.
Looks like I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Several years of drugs in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by living dead.
But I'm not.
I'm negative.
It's official.
When the pain disappears, the real battle begins.
Depression, boredom...
You feel so bad that you want to fuck yourself up.
Tommy, it's Mark.
Are you okay?
- Are you going out a little bit?
- Are you watching football?
- No.
Neither do I.
Did you do your test?
Yeah.
Are you clean?
Yeah.
That's cool.
Sorry, Tommy.
You got anything?
No, I don't touch it anymore.
Can I borrow some money?
I didn't get my check.
Thank you, Mark.
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.
I mean, not for me.
It's easy to be a philosopher, when you don't have the blood that rots.
What do you want?
- So you're clean?
- Yeah.
- You swear to me?
- I'll tell you.
Don't get upset, I have the right to ask.
- Doesn't it smell like shit?
- No.
- I'd do a good job of it.
- It's not.
- It smells like it.
- You're too young.
Too young for what?
You're not getting any younger.
The world changes, music changes, even drugs change.
You stay here all day long, obsessed with the hero and Ziggy Pop.
Iggy Pop.
Whatever.
He died anyway.
He's not dead.
He played here last year.
Tommy went to see him.
I mean, you have to move on.
She was right.
I had to move on.
I didn't have 36 solutions.
Lifestyle rental agency.
Yes.
He's in a beautiful Victorian building.
Ideally located in a quiet street near shops and transport.
Two bedrooms and an American kitchen.
Equipped and in perfect condition.
Many closets.
All comfort, for 320 pounds a week.
I made my hole, I led my little life.
Sometimes I thought about friends, but I wouldn't say I missed them.
London was the city of the boom, you could make your butter in the melee.
We didn't take it away.
I have a beautiful Victorian building.
I liked it all.
Profit, loss, margins, OPA, loan, rental, sub-rent, condominium, scam, entourloupe, rehabilitation.
Who has the keys to Talgarth Road?
The company no longer existed.
Even if it existed, it didn't concern me.
For the first time in my adult life, I was almost fine.
"Dear Mark, I'm glad you got a job and a flat.
"At the moment, it's going to school.
I'm not pregnant, thank you.
"Your friend Sick Boy asked me to work for him.
"I sent him for a walk.
"I met Spud who said hello to you.
I mean, if I understand.
"We haven't seen Tommy in a long time.
"As for Francis Begbie, we see him a lot on TV this week.
"He's wanted for the armed attack
"of a jewelery in Corstorphine.
"Take care of yourself.
I kiss you, Diane."
Francis Begbie.
Oh, no.
With an armed hand?
With a fake gun?
Do these bastards have the nerve to call it an armed robbery?
Damn it, it's a scandal.
It's supposed to be massive money, but it's shit.
Young couples put all their savings in there.
- That's outrageous.
- A little, yes.
Don't you have a Bolino hanging out?
I've got the fucking fangs.
Rents.
Begbie settled in no time.
I don't have any cigarettes.
It's me.
Rents.
He's a psychopath, sure.
But he's also a friend, what can we do?
Go drop me a bet.
Why don't you go?
I'm on the run, I can't walk around the street, asshole.
At Doncaster, 4:40 p.m., you put five books on Bad Boy.
And buy me beer, too.
Come on, Bad Boy.
Come on, it's okay.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Bad Boy.
A 16 to 1.
With the winnings we went to party.
Diane was right.
The world is changing.
Music changes, drugs change, even people change.
In 1000 years, there'll be more guys and girls, than jerks.
I think it's great.
Too bad Begbie wasn't warned.
Oh, shit!
I think we're heterosexual by default, not by choice.
It depends on who you like.
It's just a matter of aesthetics, nothing to do with morality.
Damn it!
But try to explain that to Begbie.
I'm not a faggot. I'm not a faggot.
Anyway, you could've taken your foot.
Listen to me, you fucking junkie.
If you're kidding me again, I'll cut them off.
Do you understand?
Since I lost sight of him, Sick Boy had become a pimp and a drug dealer, and he had come to combine pleasure with business, to make contacts, as he liked to repeat, for the deal of the century that would make him a rich man.
Excellent fries.
I can't believe you did this.
I got a good price.
I needed money.
But it was my TV.
If I'd known you'd have a TV crisis, I'd have abstained.
Besides, she was rented.
Aren't you done?
- Do you have a passport?
- Why?
I know a guy, he runs a hotel, a mess.
He's got a lot of contacts.
He gets richer by using English passports to smugglers.
It pays a lot.
And why would I sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
I had to get rid of them.
Sick Boy didn't do the deal of the century, he was broke.
He was snuggling with Begbie in my room to find something to sting.
I decided to install them in a very popular property.
They didn't pay rent.
When my boss found two pigeons ready to pay, they felt threatened.
There are closets, all the comforts.
For 320 pounds a week.
And it's been over.
But we had another reason to go home.
Tommy.
Tommy knew he had the virus, but he didn't know it would go so fast.
Did he have pneumonia, cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis.
He made some kind of attack.
What's that?
He wanted to see Lizzy again.
She sent him for a walk.
So he bought her a gift, a kitten.
- But Lizzy put him back in?
- Exactly.
"I don't want a cat," she said, "Get out."
Tommy had to keep the kitten.
You can imagine the painting.
For all of us gathered here, Thomas McKenzie has played different roles in our lives.
Thomas was a son...
He didn't take care of it, the cat peed and shit all over the place.
Tommy was at the stake all the time, high at the amphets or the hero.
He didn't know we caught the toxo with the cat shit.
...a man of heart who knew how to enjoy life.
- Neither am I. What is it?
- That's horrible.
- Some kind of abscess in the brain.
- Shit!
And then what?
He had migraines and increased doses to calm the pain.
Then he had an ass attack.
All of a sudden.
He died three weeks after he returned from the hospital.
He stayed forever before the neighbors complained about the smell and asked the police to break down the door.
Tommy was face-to-face, in his vomit.
He left us, but left us many memories.
The cat was fine.
Please stand up for the grounding.
"You thought I'd let you cry
"When there's room for two on my horse?
"Put it up, Tommy, don't die.
"I can go as fast as two
"When we grow up, we'll be soldiers
"And our horses will not be toys
"I wonder if we'll remember
"From the time we were two little boys"
Did you put it in the perfume?
Your turn.
What?
We met a guy at Swanney's.
You know him, it's Mikey Forrester.
Yeah.
He's got some stuff.
- A good package.
- How much?
He said about two kilos.
He flirted in a pub near the docks a week ago, and he met two Russian sailors there.
They had the stuff on them.
They were in a hurry to sell it.
He woke up the next day, and realized what he had done, and it made him a little nervous.
He wants to get rid of it.
So what?
He came to see me, I offered to buy it for him at a reasonable price, with the intention of getting the package back to one of my buddies in London.
We're back from Tommy's funeral and you're talking about heroin dealer?
Yeah.
What's the price?
- 4,000 pounds.
- You don't have them.
- We're missing 2,000 pounds.
- Too bad.
Everyone knows you've saved money in London.
Sorry, guys, I don't have 2,000 pounds.
I know you have them.
I saw your account statement.
You're a pain in the ass.
2,133 pounds.
Two kilos.
It's gonna be ten years from now.
Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors, what the fuck is this?
You're out of jail.
Was it so great that you wanted to go back?
I want to get some money.
If everyone shuts up, no one's going to the cabin.
I didn't tell anyone what I thought might happen in London.
There were plenty of possibilities I wouldn't talk about.
Some ideas I had to keep for myself.
What I wasn't told when we bought the junk was that a lucky boy should taste it.
Begbie didn't trust Spud and Sick Boy became cautious.
I took my sleeve up, stole my vein, and I did the right thing.
She's good, oh, cow!
Yeah, a hell of a fix.
I promised myself another one before I got to London.
Only one, in memory of the good old days.
Just to piss Begbie off.
He was in the middle of a nightmare.
The most messy plan of a long series.
A plan mounted with three well-known wankers, Edinburgh's cream.
I knew what he was messing with.
Any trouble, and he'd let us go immediately.
Anyway, he had no choice.
If he got squeezed with a bag of powder after his robbery, he would take 15 or 20 years.
He was a tough guy, but he didn't give a shit about rotting 20 years in jail.
That was supposed to be my last fix.
But let's be clear, there's last fix and last fix.
What about this one?
- Did you get any cards?
- What?
Cards, I told you to take some.
I forgot.
It becomes deadly, after a while, without cards.
I'm so sorry.
- It's a little late.
- You had to take them yourself.
You had to take them, asshole.
Damn it.
Are these your friends?
- Yeah, they're the guys I told you about.
- All right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah.
- You weren't followed?
Good.
- Are you all right?
He immediately saw who he had to do with.
Little wankers fell on a big shot.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
How many are you asking for?
20,000 pounds.
I don't think it's worth more than 15,000.
It smelled like he was inflating.
He didn't have to talk.
What would we have done if he hadn't taken it?
Would we have gone to sell it on the street?
- 19,000 pounds.
- I won't be able to go that far, I'm sorry.
All right, lay down 16,000, then.
All right, I'm extending 16,000 pounds.
They're 2,000-pound lizards.
There are two of them.
Four.
We agreed on 16,000.
He had more in his briefcase, but it was better than nothing.
...that's eight.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
It was a pleasure doing business with you.
Better.
Is it okay?
Yeah!
For a while, it was really great.
Like we're really close, like real friends.
It's like this, it moves you inside.
It doesn't last.
Not like 16,000 pounds.
What about you, Spud?
Do you have any investment plans?
- You're gonna buy yourself a little island in the sun?
- For 4,000 pounds?
You have an unfortunate palm tree, two rocks and a septic tank.
I don't know.
I'm gonna buy my mom something.
Paying me good speed, not drowsiness.
Get a chick and treat her.
- And fuck her to death?
- No, love, the real one.
But in the meantime, I'd have a little Jewish princess tonight.
- What an asshole.
- Or a Catholic.
If it's all about spending on a chicken, you might as well give me your share.
- Send the rest.
- I paid for my tour.
- The last one was for me.
- It's your turn, Franco.
All right.
The same thing?
Yeah.
I'm gonna pee.
Don't touch my money.
We'll get out of here as soon as you turn your back.
- You better run fast.
- You can't keep the distance, you son of a bitch.
Don't move, while I'm gone...
When you come back, we'll be far away.
- Do that and I'll kill you.
- I don't doubt it.
I don't doubt it.
What do you care?
What?
Right?
Are you serious?
I don't know.
What do you think?
- You're still here.
- We wouldn't do that to a friend.
I wouldn't hesitate.
Where's Franco?
- God damn it!
- I'm sorry.
I'll pay you another one.
You messed up my suit, you stupid bastard.
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.
That's not what's gonna dry me, asshole.
Calm down.
He apologized.
He didn't apologize for being a big jerk.
You're shitting me.
If you don't hold the alcohol, you don't have to drink.
Fuck you.
No, Frank, don't do this.
Goddamn it.
- So here, congratulations.
- Shut up.
- You cut my hand off.
- You were in my hands.
Help me!
Are there any other candidates?
You?
You?
Hey, Renton.
Bring me a cigarette.
- We should get out of here.
- I have to go to the hospital.
You're not going to a fucking hospital.
You stay here.
You're bringing me a fucking cigarette.
And the bag.
I found myself all kinds of good reasons.
It wasn't a big deal, a little betrayal.
Our paths had diverged, that kind of thing.
But let's face it, I had fucked them, my so-called buddies.
Begbie, I didn't give a shit.
And Sick Boy would have done the same if he could.
When Spud, yeah, I was sorry.
He didn't hurt anyone.
Smoker!
Smoker!
Open the door!
Why did I do that?
I had a lot of false explanations.
The truth is, I'm a bad guy.
But it's gonna change.
I'm gonna change.
It's all over.
I'm getting clean and moving in the right direction. I'm choosing life.
I'll gloat in advance.
I'm going to be like you.
The job, the family, the stupid TV.
The washing machine, the car, the CD player, an electric can opener, the health, cholesterol, the dental mutual, the milkings, the bar, the sweater, the suitcases, the living room, the DIY, the TV games, the fast food, the kids, the walks in the park, 8 hours a day, the golf, the washing of the car, a choice of sweaters, the family Christmases, the savings, the tax breaks, the sink, the way out, see coming, the day of his death.
