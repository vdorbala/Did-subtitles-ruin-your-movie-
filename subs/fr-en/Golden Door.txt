Come on, I'm telling you!
Hello?
Who's this one?
The deaf mute.
What do you want?
Come on.
Shall I tell him?
She's possessed.
She doesn't talk, she doesn't sleep and she eats more.
It's a bad spell.
She says a snake is twisting in her belly.
How did that snake get in?
Come on, tell him.
- Come on, come on.
You hear what she's telling you?
- Come here.
How did that happen?
When Don Ercole promised us two rich Americans...
Look at these cards.
No, I don't understand things written.
But it's not written things.
It's real.
Look at that onion.
And on the tree, is that money?
This is the new land.
Burn it to me.
Don't be afraid.
What do we do?
Shall we take it off?
I can't take it anymore!
It's over.
You're free.
There we are.
We're bringing you the stones.
We'd like to ask you something.
What to do?
Or stay here?
Just send us a sign, just a sign.
We're waiting here.
We're not moving.
My good Lord.
Catch the goat.
Where is he?
Inside?
Hello.
We're bringing you our animals.
Look at that.
Look.
Stronger than a mare, and the little one... he doesn't even have a month.
He's beautiful, isn't he?
And look at this one...
Is it safe this time?
- Safer than ever.
What about your mother?
If she wants to come, she'll come, or I'll leave her here with you.
We're leaving.
Let's get you some clothes.
Leave the animals.
Come in.
Come on!
Sit there.
Take that hat off of me.
Take it off!
Get your hands off me!
Give me your foot.
These shoes were Giovanni Graminia's. Bad seed, healthy soul!
They look perfect to me.
- They are.
Get your foot up.
See those wooden soles?
You'll see how long they're going to last.
Your foot.
That was the son of the Baron, the one who died young.
Follow my advice:
Don't put them on until you're in town.
Of course.
Do you understand?
You got the Baron's shoes.
This... this is for Salvatore.
This, on the other hand... is for Angelo.
And this... for Pietro.
All baron's stuff, don't you think?
I'm not gonna send you to America in rags.
God will give it back to you.
Come on, get over there and I'll look at you.
How am I gonna find my brother over there?
Maybe he's become an important person.
He may have changed his name, but his head couldn't change her, you're the same.
I bet they'll take you for him and even welcome you as a king.
Do you know where these coats come from?
They were at the puccia robbers.
That way, you'll take our dead.
Come on!
End your farewells!
Let's go!
Cut over there.
When did your brother leave?
When Pietro was born.
Why didn't we leave, too?
Because.
How's your brother?
What do you mean?
That's my spitting portrait.
We're twins.
Are we sure we can find him?
Of course, I'm telling you, that's my spitting portrait.
Your clothes!
Stop!
That's enough!
Stop!
Damn!
Hold this!
Look at that.
You're sick or something!
- Shut up!
Pick up your stuff.
How are we going to go to America?
Your shoes.
I lost my shoes.
You'll go barefoot in America!
- You idiot!
Find them now.
Damn I am.
- I got them!
Pick them up!
Move!
Move!
Come on.
Your stuff!
You have to bend them.
We need to look like princes.
Here.
Don't mess it up.
Damn I am.
Let's go!
Look at this!
- What?
Come on!
Hey, you!
All the spirits are here!
They don't want to know anything!
They don't want to let us go!
Can't the spirits come with us?
They're afraid of the sea.
They say that above the sea they steal wandering souls.
You have to convince them!
Damn I'm and all of mine too!
Do we have to stay here?
Are we gonna die here?
Nice life than ours!
She thinks I'm scared?
She thinks I'm scared!
All we have to do is stay, then.
Get out of here.
Let's go, it's time.
Mom, where are you going?
Look for you, renegade.
Your brother doesn't live anymore.
You left me here!
I want to see the new land too.
Poor man, can he come too?
I'll bring it to you.
Come over here.
Come closer.
You're making a head of it!
Laugh.
Laugh.
You're like the seeds we're going to plant in fertile soil.
You are our future.
Come on, kiss yourself.
Like you're gonna be back soon.
That's enough.
Get ready.
It is God who guides you.
Let's hurry.
Come on, move on.
Salvatore, do you see those two girls?
I entrust them to you.
They'll come as they're gone.
What do you mean?
- That's right.
Get in, Pietro.
Help me with my shoes.
Fresh fish!
He'll hold to America!
We don't want it.
Salvatore, get me down.
Take your stuff.
Above all, don't touch anything.
Pietro?
Where are you?
Let's not lose ourselves.
- Pietro, come here.
Let's stay together!
We don't want anything!
Move!
- What's that?
Move!
What do you want?
Are you going to America?
- You have to follow me.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
Do you have to come with us?
Take us, then!
Are you sick?
No, we're going to America.
Do you have any redness?
Stomach pain?
Is that scratching you?
Show me your tongue, you got lice?
Itching?
Are you blind?
What's the matter with you?
This one doesn't talk, he looks mute...
There's a mute!
- No one's mute here.
The deaf mutes, they bring them back.
What are they doing?
They send them back to their homeland.
- Where?
I can sell you this medicine.
It would make a dead man talk.
What's he talking about?
I'm a doctor, too. I know about it.
Doctor or not, you have to buy this medicine against mutes.
Let me see if you have lice.
Show me your tongue.
Get the fuck out of here!
Where are you going with that bottle?
- In America.
But it pays off.
- What do you mean?
You have to pay, ma'am.
- What's he saying?
It's only two cents.
- Two?
But why?
- That's how it is.
But what is it?
- A tooth remedy.
He said it was against the dumb!
No, it's for the teeth.
Then we don't want it.
Let's go.
Mancuso, there's four of us with these ladies who're getting married.
Your portraits?
Do you have them?
Your portraits?
- We didn't...
Carmelo, take them to the portraits.
Follow me.
Malpoli, come on!
Go on, go on!
Come here.
Come on, move!
Miss, are you with them?
How many are you?
- Mancuso.
Mancuso how?
Mancuso...
What's your name?
- Mancuso Salvatore.
You?
- Angelo.
You?
What's your name?
What's his name?
- Mancuso Pietro.
What about you, ma'am?
What's your name?
- Fortunata.
You, miss?
- Rita.
Miss, what's your name?
- Rosa.
What about you, miss?
- Lucy.
You can go.
Miss...
Miss redhead!
I'm talking to you.
Is she with you?
I'm sorry, I don't speak Italian.
Are you English?
Do you speak English?
You look beautiful, my dear.
Are you travelling alone?
Yes... with this family.
What are we still doing here?
Let's go back up.
I'm talking to the lady.
Do you have a fiancé in America?
No fiancé, no America!
Do you have a passport?
Money?
Why?
Curious, huh?
I have a fiancé for you in America.
America is mine!
Come on, come on.
Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
Get the fuck out of here!
Salvatore!
It's none of our business.
Get in!
Come on!
Third class, take out your tickets.
Let's stay together!
Come on, Pietro.
Where are you going, Pietro?
Stay with me, mule face!
Men, this way!
Don't block the way!
Men on this side, women on the other.
Women with women and men with men.
No jostling!
Stop pushing!
Mancuso, there's four of us.
We're all Mancuso.
The men here, the women there.
You stay with me.
Stay calm!
My whole family with me!
Excuse me, ma'am, this is my bed.
I'm in now.
Look, it's written here.
I can't read.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
Get a bed, Pietro.
That's good, Pietro.
Bravo, Pietruzzo.
I'm standing here.
Right under there, Dad.
Is your father well settled?
Yeah, he's old, you know.
Mancuso Salvatore, from Petralia.
Spera Calogero from Realimici.
I'm sorry...
- It's nothing.
Mancuso Salvatore, from Petralia.
Mangiapane Giuseppe, from Carini.
Esposito Nicola, from Cinisi.
Mancuso Salvatore.
He's my son.
Who would have thought they were sleeping with so many strangers?
Where are all these strangers?
We're all Italian.
- Italians?
What language does he speak?
Don't you know you're Italian?
If you say so.
You who know so much, when are we going to see the Tantic?
He must be talking about the Atlantic!
Yeah, that's right.
- In a week.
Can you help me, please?
Thank you.
Why are you turning your dress around?
Why are you turning your dress around?
So you don't get her dirty on the trip.
What's your name?
- Rita.
Why are you eating garlic?
So you don't get sick.
You want some?
- No, thank you.
It stinks.
What's your name?
How long is this going to last?
I didn't deserve that.
I was very quiet at home...
Ma'am...
You can talk less loud, I have a headache.
Keep it!
I'm not interested.
That's all that was missing!
The whole trip with her complaining of a headache.
But there's nothing around.
Nothing!
- What are you talking about?
Come this way.
Come on, sit down.
Sit there.
I could easily find someone to help you get out of this mess.
A man who could protect you and even marry you.
It wouldn't be that bad.
I'll find you a rich gentleman...
Their horses are big and strong because their roads are endless.
I hear there are even rivers of milk in Calaformia.
I can't swim, but I'd like to swim in a milk river.
- That's it... and why not some flying donkeys that throw money.
You really believe it!
Bring this to Miss Luce.
Tell him it's from Mangiapane.
Give this to Rita, from Giovanni.
Excuse me, but what are you up to with Miss Luce?
Nothing and you?
She looked at me.
- Me too.
What do you mean if she's looking at me?
You're saying anything.
Aren't you serious?
Anyone can have it.
All you have to do is pay, what do you mean, pay?
With all due respect, I'm not interested in what you're saying.
Miss Luce travels with me, and no one should disrespect her!
Miss Luce?
From my father.
Where's your mom?
- She's dead.
A long time ago.
Our stories don't look at the lady.
And you're not married?
You don't want to get married?
Shut up!
I hear Miss Luce was married to a nobleman.
A close friend of the king of his country.
He had a castle.
But she caught up with an American.
So she left her husband to go to America.
But once she was there, her American disappeared.
And she couldn't get in.
She's looking for a man now.
I hear Miss Luce was married to the king's son.
He had so many women that he sent her to America.
And now she's all alone, looking for a man to take care of her.
Maybe she's a queen, then.
How do I know?
Mr. Belvedere, Lucy.
Mr. Belvedere is the largest ice store in New York.
There's the sleepwalk again.
If you want the protection of my men, you have to deserve it.
And stay calm, just like the rest of us.
My son's not for you.
You're too different.
You need a man to talk to you.
Look at your hands.
Why?
What's with my hands?
Come here, Pietro!
Where is this America?
But we can't see her.
Hello, miss.
You look younger without mustache.
But I'm still young.
Salvatore, will you marry me?
Who?
Me?
Of course.
Right away, even.
But you're the one who's asking?
I need a man to help me get in.
I'm here.
When do we get married?
As soon as we get to the island, you'll have to call me.
I'll call you right away.
I'm not afraid.
Salvatore, I'm not marrying you for love.
Love?
We don't know each other.
It takes time for these things.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Let's do one thing.
Give me a wick of hair.
That way, we won't get lost.
I don't believe in your magic.
In time, I'll teach you all this.
We don't have all day.
Everybody behind the line.
Stop!
Stay well behind the line.
This way, this way.
Baggage down.
Take off your hats.
Lower.
What day is it?
What month?
What day is it?
I wish I knew.
What day is it?
Leave the cross.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Why are you doing this?
Can't you answer that?
What's your name?
- Mancuso Salvatore.
Where are you from?
- From Petralia, Suttana.
How old are you?
- Thirty-seven years.
Was it difficult?
Take your bags back.
On the line.
And calmly.
Without pushing.
Look down.
Upstairs.
Downstairs.
Upstairs.
Don't worry.
It's all right.
Look down.
- Open your eyes.
Don't move.
We won't do anything to you.
If you move, it's worse.
- Go on.
Next!
Hat.
Show your hands.
Get them up.
Spread your fingers.
Turn them around.
Open your mouth and pull your tongue.
Open your mouth.
Pull your tongue.
Again.
More.
On the side.
Come on, even more.
Larger.
Pull your tongue.
More!
Did you get sick?
Can you talk?
Why don't you answer?
He's my son.
Can you convince him to answer?
He's got a hard head, but at work.
Take off your pants, Pietro.
You're gonna take those pants off!
Come on!
Leave your brother alone.
Pietro, don't be afraid.
Take off your clothes.
It's because of the trip, the poor...
He's my son...
My son stays with me!
Come back here.
I'm telling you, he's my son!
We have to finish the exam.
What test?
Don't worry, Pietro.
Lie down on the side.
Ma'am, you must lie down on the side.
Like that, the head on this side.
What's she doing?
Don't touch me!
Take your hands off!
Stay calm.
It's an ordinary visit.
I don't want anyone to touch me!
Excuse me.
Ma'am, this woman isn't used to it.
Are you English, miss?
Did you come with the Italians?
Yes, ma'am.
Your husband's traveling with you?
My fiancé, he has to pick me up.
It's rare for an English woman to travel with Italians.
You will be questioned about this.
Don't be afraid, you have time.
Think about what you're doing.
Math test.
How many legs does a horse have?
Four.
How many legs have a horse and a chicken?
Four and two.
Who are they?
Who's walking.
- No.
How many legs are there in total?
How many legs have a pig, a chicken and a goat?
That's good.
This is the house.
And now we can put to dry, or keep the animals...
Put the animals there.
You're in the open sea, on a boat.
In the middle of a storm.
In the boat with you, there are two bags.
One is filled with bread and the other with gold.
To save you, which one are you throwing?
Why throw those bags away?
What am I doing...
I can't throw away the gold.
Bread, I eat it.
Nothing... I don't throw anything away.
Is that right?
That's right, isn't it?
I'm ready.
That's it.
I love games.
I thought you were looking for infectious diseases and disorders...
Unfortunately, we have been able to prove that the lack of intelligence is genetically transmitted, so it is contagious, in a sense.
We keep small people from mingling with our citizens.
What a modern vision!
We're gonna do an exercise.
I'll give you instructions that you'll have to execute in the right order.
Open the door and place the chair by the door.
You have to move things in the right order.
First you open the door and then you move the chair.
You're wrong.
I asked you to open the door and put the chair by the door.
Start again.
That's good.
Now, open the door, put the chair by the door.
Take the book and put it down.
Miss Agostino, stand up, please.
Mr. Scandito, get up.
Do you recognize this woman as your fiancée and future wife?
Do you recognize this man as your fiancé and future husband?
Miss, look up, please.
Do you recognize him as your future husband?
The wedding will take place on the 17th at Ellis Island.
You can offer your flowers.
Sit down.
- Congratulations!
Miss Rosa Napolitano, get up.
Mr. Ettore Scandelli, get up.
Do you recognize this woman as your fiancée and future wife?
Do you recognize this man as your future husband?
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
- How much?
I'm thirty-five years old.
- Liar!
Scratch!
I thought you were young and tall!
Short on legs, yes!
Look, it looks like you're still sitting!
Is that why I left my family?
A father, I already have one in the country!
You don't need another one!
Laideron...
And money, do you have money?
So, do you recognize this man as your future husband?
The wedding will take place on Ellis Island on the 17th of the month.
Sit down.
Miss Dolores Torres, get up.
Mr Sergio Dominguez, get up.
Sergio Dominguez, I know you're here.
Why don't you show up?
How long are you gonna leave me here?
I've been waiting for days.
Which one?
This one?
Gentlemen, your tickets.
Here, it's for you.
Present.
- Sit down.
I'm right where I am.
What are those crosses, those stars?
She wonders what these figures are.
Does she think she's being hurt?
You think we can hurt you?
What do you want from all of us?
What do we want from them all?
- All of them, who?
You, who?
Everyone who comes from the old world.
We need to know if you can enter the new world.
Who do you think you are?
To decide if we're good enough to get into your new world?
If you want to come in, you have to accept the rules.
Then sit down and take the test, or we'll repatriate you.
We'll send you home.
What is this drink?
It's blind glass.
We can't see anything.
Nothing at all.
From up there, we can see.
We should go upstairs.
What do we do?
- Let's go upstairs.
What are these things so high?
Looks like tricks.
- Or bell towers.
Maybe they're houses?
It's a hundred-storey house!
And how do we get there?
In a wooden box that goes up and down... on its own!
Even animals can come up?
Everything can go up.
I wouldn't want to go home in a box.
- Neither do I.
My house must touch the ground.
I'd like a house in the sky.
What are you doing?
Immediately!
What do we do, we pray, too?
Our Father or I greet Mary?
Let's all say it.
Our Father who are in heaven...
Looks like we're eating a cloud!
It's a gift from God.
The wedding will take place on the 17th of the month on Ellis Island.
There's no more names.
We've got ten minutes left.
Excuse me, you didn't call us.
It's because your fiancé isn't registered.
But he's waiting for us to call him.
Where is he?
- Right there.
Is that him?
Sir, have you completed the form?
Do you know this woman?
Of course I know her, too.
What's his name?
Luce how?
Lucy Reed.
You never remember.
It's a hard name to say.
Have him fill out the form.
Answer the questions, please.
What is it?
What am I supposed to do with this?
You don't want to get married anymore?
Of course I want to, but you have to write it down.
I can't write, I can't even read.
Can't we get married anymore?
He can't write.
He has to come back with someone who will write for him.
I'm the one who takes care of it when he needs to write.
What should I do?
He doesn't know anyone outside.
Hurry up and fill out the form.
Mr. Mancuso, get up.
Miss Lucy Reed, get up.
Do you recognize this woman as your fiancée and future wife?
Of course.
Why else are we here?
Do you recognize this man as your fiancé and future husband?
The wedding will take place on Ellis Island.
If you have any flowers to offer her...
I'm offering you this crown... that flies!
Mr. Mancuso, come closer, please.
Mr. Mancuso, your son is silent, he cannot be admitted.
Your mother is simple in mind, she cannot be admitted.
What is your decision? Continue the admission process or go home?
But...
Excuse me...
I don't want to disrespect you. I don't understand.
What's the matter?
What's wrong with these two?
What's wrong with them, my mother and my son?
Is that because he's not talking?
That's much better!
That way, he doesn't bother anyone.
He never complains!
And my mother, look at her, she looks like a little girl!
It's true she's talking a lot, but I'll lock her up to keep her out.
Would we have come all this way to split up now?
Grandma told me she wanted to go home.
She also told me that the rest of us had to stay here.
