Benjamin.
Benjamin?
- What's wrong?
- Everything's fine.
- Then why did you wake me up?
- I was doing a test.
But no tests are planned.
The test consisted of carrying out an unanticipated test.
- Why?
- Be more specific, Benjamin.
Why did you want to wake me up and run an unanticipated test?
Vouloir is a human emotion that I am incapable of.
- I know that.
- Benjamin.
Can we play chess now?
Tom and Jerry: catharsis and cathexis.
AJ Marley.
Doctoral Thesis: Anthropology.
Start recording.
This animated animosity served the masses of collective catharsis.
When violent cartoons were banned by law at the beginning of the 21st century, the idealized and apparently benign cartoon creatures that followed unleashed the malice of humans and social polarity...
Would you like some music before you start, co-driver Vanzant?
- If you want.
- How about that, co-pilot Vanzant?
Confidence in identity and status.
Age: 32 years.
Six-month detoxification cure.
Pilot's license returned.
Probation:
rescue in remote space.
Reflex quotient: 1.5 Stress limit: minus 4
We're gonna have to do better, Nick.
- The neuroscanner is good.
- Good.
- What happened to the robot?
- Nothing.
Really?
I hope nothing happens to me.
The commander likes 20th century cultural objects, so he was disguised as a 14-18 war fighter pilot.
We do this kind of thing for fun.
We're all trying to get along.
- I'm a great fit.
- You've been on board for 12 days.
The robot is the first crew member you're interested in.
- Commander's watching Tom and Jerry.
- He's doing a PhD.
..the computer specialist calls his Sweetie computer and the two medical technicians do anatomy TPs at the slightest opportunity.
This is my sixth paramedical tour with this crew.
He knows how to do his job.
We're on a mission for months.
Nothing's happening.
People feel lonely.
Then all of a sudden, it's messy, we do our job, and it's the flat calm again. The crew is nice.
You want to explain to me what you're doing here?
A military pilot is not probationing a paramedic ship.
I like remote space.
It's quiet.
And people respect the privacy of others.
Take one a day.
Get dressed.
Zyracon, huh?
The pills of happiness.
I'm happy.
It's hard to get off a drug like the Hazen.
Zyracon fights residual effects.
- I don't touch it anymore.
- Interaction helps, too.
The crew is nice.
You should get to know them.
Thank you, Doctor.
According to my analysis of the game, you have a 77%% chance of losing, Benjamin.
Eight kilometers of fiber optics, it undermines the spirit of competition, don't you think, Sweetie?
Gin.
When I reprogrammed him for this tour, I added human traits to his personality profile.
I wanted them to realize it, to piss them off.
But if they did, they'd kill me.
I hope you don't turn me in...
You don't know me well enough to hope for that.
It's up to you.
My analysis of co-pilot Vanzant suggests a high probability that he'll turn you in, Benjamin.
I'm not gonna turn you in.
The laser pulse is concentrated in a surgical beam capable of the most precise incisions.
- Hello.
Can I sit down?
- I'm not sure.
- These are your orders: interaction.
- Then the Zyracon works.
I'm nice and I need to thank you?
If you're nice, it's medicine you need to thank.
To me, being detoxified is the same thing as being alive.
We're either... or we're not.
Count them.
They're all there.
Since we don't seem to be born to get along, so tell me what's bothering you so much about me.
It's the Hazen I don't like.
It's not just a drug that alters the mind and helps escape.
I don't like what it does to those who take it, or what they do to others.
- I knew someone...
- I'm not someone.
I didn't say you were.
I can't do anything to change the past, neither yours nor mine.
It's up to you, Doctor.
Reception of an emergency distress signal.
- We're back on the tab!
- I love to feel useful.
I'll be in the engine room.
I forgot everything.
What's my job?
- Come on.
- No joke, it's been a long time!
Reception of an emergency distress signal.
Passerelle.
It's okay.
The infirmary.
It's okay.
What's going on?
Signal received.
SOS, critical situation.
The signal's damaged.
It took five days to get here.
A routing error?
No.
It's a direct call.
Direct?
We don't get direct calls.
Origin?
Pohl 6822.
I'm getting something else.
Call sign from a merchant ship.
It's Titan 37.
It's a mining operation.
Long after the colony's forward post.
Sweetie, find the Titan 37 file, Pohl 6822.
Titan 37: Moon mining operation.
This moon has been evicted from its orbit around its stellar system
- and is classified as a solitary body.
- A lonely moon.
Great gravitational instability in this sector.
The operation was abandoned when the moon drifted into uncharted space.
Complete evacuation of the crew five years and three months ago.
A SOS from an abandoned mine?
Location of the distress call:
3,432 light years.
If we want to answer that call in our lifetime, we're gonna have to jump.
We haven't jumped in three rounds.
I'm not gonna blow up that crew without any insurance.
I want a name with some authority.
If we don't, we're not going.
Identification analysis.
Transmission signature:
Karl James Larson.
Karl.
Karl Larson!
You know him?
The worst nightmare I've ever had.
Mr. Vanzant, please take us on a road.
Yes, sir.
The size thruster is recharged.
Call them, Sweetie.
All the crew: prepare for the dimensional jump.
Go on.
The road?
Traced.
Dimensional stabilization chamber in the process of sterilization.
Last time, I was sick for a month.
It's gonna be okay.
A guy panicked on the countdown and got out of his CSD.
Another guy takes it with him in his CDS.
And they're forced to jump dimensions like that.
Seriously!
When they arrive...
There's only one guy left.
He's four meters long, and he's got two heads!
All of a sudden, the heads are starting to talk to each other.
And they say, "We're here?"
- It's not funny.
- If that's funny.
Not funny at all.
Two minutes before dimensional jump.
One minute before the dimensional jump is activated.
To all the crew, take a seat in the stabilization boxes.
According to studies, it improves sexual resistance.
- Hallelujah!
- You know I'm gonna catch you!
Yeah?
Kaela.
- I need to talk to you.
- Later.
Take mine.
- I'll take yours.
- Why?
We'll talk about it later.
- Let's call it the musical chair.
- All right!
30 seconds before dimensional jump.
To all the crew, take a seat in the stabilization boxes.
To all the crew, take a seat in the stabilization boxes.
Countdown.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Plasma acceleration.
I got you!
This one, I really got you.
Oh, my God, no.
Don't touch anything!
Her skin has merged with polyverre.
Danika!
No. 3 laser scalpel and vascular cautere.
He's still alive!
What's going on?
Sweetie?
- Impact of debris.
Damaged tank.
- Hold him!
- Benjamin!
Go on the bridge!
High gravity field.
Serious fuel loss.
Increased severity.
Scalpel laser!
Caut√®re!
What's going on?
The controls and systems are working.
- Get the engine ready.
- Significant damage.
Serious fuel loss.
Oh, my God.
A giant blue star.
That must be ten times the gravity of our sun.
We are in a high-gravity field, on the passage of the debris of this moon!
Impossible to cauterize if this panel does not remain closed!
Be careful.
Lunar impact in 57 seconds.
- Speed of descent?
- 98 meters per second.
Time before impact?
49 seconds.
- Recommended alternatives?
- Estimation...
Sweetie, get us out of here!
- The sign will open!
- The controls aren't responding!
- Alternatives, Sweetie!
- Unacceptable risk in any case.
- It opens!
- Cut the power!
Now, for Christ's sake!
- It's not working!
- Close the sign!
- Turn on the stowage thrusters.
- Inadequate...
Switch to manual mode.
No!
We need Sweetie!
What are you doing?
I'm saving our asses!
Lock-in thrusters.
Kill me.
Please.
- How much fuel is used?
- I don't know.
- The sign will open.
- Don't kill him!
Please.
Don't kill him.
Oh, my God.
Clean it up.
Sweetie.
- You need me again, Nick?
- What's the situation?
- Fuel loss: 82%%.
To leave high gravity, the dimensional thruster must be recharged.
- How long are you reloading?
- Five o'clock and a minute.
- How long before flammability point?
- Solar incineration in 17 hours and 12 minutes.
That leaves us 11 minutes, Nick.
Hold the orbit by propulsion every 15 minutes.
I'm holding on to the orbit.
Diffuses our identity and position, all coordinated.
See if you can contact the Titan.
This is the Trans Soma Nightingale 229 rescue ship.
Commander Marley?
This is the medical rescue ship Trans Soma Nightingale 229. To you titan 37 Trans Soma mining operation.
I repeat: here the medical rescue ship Trans Soma
Nightingale 229. To you Titan 37 Trans Soma mining operation.
Did I wake you?
Were you reading or...
I managed to bring on board a pretty good bottle of Pear, and I thought
that, in a friendly spirit, we could drink together.
It's...
- It's okay.
We...
- Let's see the bottle.
How do they put her in there?
We put the bottles on the branches with the buds inside and the pears grow in.
Then when they're ripe, we pick the bottles, pour the brandy...
Of course, the real question is how do we get her out?
The tower on E7.
Congratulations, Benjamin.
Your strategy was subtle and energetic.
You can play with me anytime you want.
Permission to have a child?
I've been trying to get it since you said you wanted a child.
What if one of us isn't accepted?
Two beautiful specimens like us, not genetically designed?
You want to laugh?
We'll be accepted.
And then we'll have a baby.
- Passerelle.
- Yes.
Nick, I think you should see this.
And then there's this.
- CSD 4.
Improper driving.
- That's what killed Marley.
- There was a warning before the jump.
- You mean he knew?
- Yes.
- That's why he took my CSD.
- Why didn't he cancel the jump?
- He thought it was worth the risk.
He should have transferred the call to another ship.
Marley would still be alive and you'd play chess with Sweetie.
What if we hadn't crucified Christ?
But it's done.
Marley's dead, we're here, and that's how it is.
We got what we got.
Present yourself on the bridge.
Now that you're rested, this is the situation.
The tank was hit when we jumped into the high gravity field.
We lost most of the fuel.
The good news is we've got enough for our stowage thrusters.
It'll give the thruster time to recharge.
Then we'll go back by dimensional jump, but it'll be fair.
How long do we have?
1 1 minutes.
We can only jump 1 minute before the ship burns?
I'm saying we've got 1 1 minutes.
That's enough.
I've been out of worse situations than that.
We're gonna be all right.
- We don't have a margin of error!
- Then we won't.
Be careful.
A transport vessel leaves the Titan Moon Mining Operation.
They must be evacuating.
Sweetie, follow his path.
Be careful.
The transport ship hung on to our transmission.
Stand by to intercept.
Put on your suits.
No response from the pilot.
The ship is on automatic approach.
You okay?
Yes.
When you said you knew worse, was that the truth?
Yeah.
When the ship fell with the engines off.
We're gonna be all right.
Be careful.
Fire on board the approaching ship.
To the attention of the approaching ship:
Turn on your stowage thrusters.
We don't have fuel for a stationary flight.
We're gonna have to catch him.
Speed up.
Excessive approach speed.
Sterilization?
- It's okay.
- The stowage will cause a tremor.
Thanks for warning us.
15 seconds before impact.
- No response from the ship.
- He's quiet.
Or unconscious.
- Be careful!
- Get out of the way!
There's fire!
Take off his helmet!
Check if he's alive.
Is that your worst nightmare?
It's not Karl.
Passerelle.
The patient is a man in his 20s, unconscious but stationary.
And that's not the person who sent the call.
You'll tell me again.
It's not Karl Larson.
Come see me as soon as you can.
Do a full system check.
All right.
There's a kind of size on his bone structure.
These matrices.
It almost looks like his bones are building up on their own.
A radioactive explosion.
No, it's too normal for that.
Enter: minor anomaly.
A normal scanner wouldn't have detected it.
Doctor.
No treatment required at this time.
He's got iron health.
Keep him in observation.
- You didn't tell me.
- It was personal.
- It was a matter of security.
- He just called Trans Soma.
He didn't call Trans Soma.
He called the Nightingale.
It was a direct call.
- Tell me what's going on.
- I can't.
I can't because I don't know.
I know a Karl James Larson, but it's not him.
He had a son.
I saw a picture of him.
There is a strong resemblance.
It could be him, but I'm not sure.
I haven't seen Karl in five years.
We broke up. I couldn't have a child.
I made a commitment to get away from him.
Well, do you need to know anything else?
He was the one who was taking hazen.
How long did I pass out?
About 20 minutes.
- How are you feeling?
- Better than the ship.
The fire really finished it!
How embarrassing!
I'm Troy.
Danika.
I'm sorry.
You're very beautiful.
I haven't seen a girl in a long time.
I'll go get you some clothes.
- There's only five CSDs left.
- And there are five of us.
We have a patient on board.
There are six of us!
We're jumping as planned.
I'll try my luck in the shuttle.
- You don't have a chance.
- Send help at the end of the jump.
By the time they arrive, I'll be pretty far in orbit.
- You'll be dead.
I don't agree!
- It's your job to agree.
Marley would ask you to do the same.
- I'm not going.
- You want me to abuse my rank.
All right.
It's an order.
I'm Dr. Evers.
How are you?
I'm glad I'm here.
Is there anyone else on Titan?
No one.
The place is a ghost ship.
The distress call came from Karl Larson.
Yeah.
He's my father.
He was my father.
He died three years ago.
Aneurysm.
Suddenly.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I'm not.
It's probably the worst crap ever.
You must agree with me.
I tried to stay as far away from him as possible.
But I went to see him when he died.
He told me that if I had a problem, you were the person to contact.
That's the best advice he's ever given me.
- You seem to have done well.
- Yeah.
Looks like you, too.
They're just vitamins.
Until the end, when he said I had to call you in case of need, he said he was sorry he didn't change while you were together.
Because he'd never have the chance to make up for it again.
He said that was what he most regretted.
This is Nick Vanzant, our commander.
This is Troy.
He's Karl Larson's son.
How are you, Commander?
I have a few questions for you.
Listen.
I know what you're going to ask me.
I was digging through the leftovers.
I'm doing recovery.
It's amazing what the government leaves behind when it abandons a place.
I was with a group of people I thought I was my friends.
We didn't find anything.
That's why they took the mothership and left me in a row with that pile of scrap metal.
Friends, huh?
That's what I thought.
And can you tell us where your friends are?
I'm not the kind of guy who gives names.
Why did you use your father's name?
I've been doing this for a while.
Since he died.
I thought as much as it's for something, right?
Tell me about the Titan.
Is there any fuel left?
- Why?
- We had an accident when we jumped.
We've lost almost all the fuel from our tanks.
If it's fuel you want, there's plenty of fuel down there.
That's one of the things we were gonna sting.
We're lucky, aren't we?
I'll get the shuttle ready.
- How's the patient?
- Cute.
I'll go see if the doctor needs help.
Yerzy.
Yerzy!
Examine the slightest corner of his ship, all his equipment.
If there's anything suspicious, I want to know.
Ask the aviator to do it.
- I'm asking you.
- Why me?
I'm a graduate technician, not a robot!
That's why I'm asking you.
Can Sweetie access the Titan's computer, see if it works?
Yeah, it's another C-1-1.
No problem.
If I go, I want a complete plan.
I want to know what I'm going through.
Do you think there's any survivors left?
I don't know.
If so, I want to know before they see me coming.
Hey, Nick, is he still like this?
He likes to play chef, doesn't he?
Pretty nervous about an ambulance ship commander.
We lost the commander in the jump.
Nick's back in charge.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say bad about him.
Both of you are...?
No.
No, but...
Nick and Dr. Evers!
You know, you have beautiful eyes.
Really?
Thank you.
We all need some romance from time to time, huh?
- Shuttle.
Are you there?
- Yeah.
What's the matter?
Look, I found something.
- You'd better come.
- I'm coming.
Yerzy?
Let me tell you something.
Whatever it is, it's the most incredible thing everyone here will see in their lives.
You cheated on this thing, didn't you?
Why would I do such a thing?
Robotic connection engaged.
Quarantine transport. Risk of biological danger.
Of course I didn't tell you.
I'm a treasure hunter.
My job consists of two things: finding and keeping.
And keeping is much more difficult!
I intercepted a transmission three years ago.
Ice mining.
They dug up something.
I didn't need to know what it was.
Know where it was enough.
Ice.
In the middle of a lonely moon.
I knew what they found was much older than that moon.
I did my research, I took some friends, and we went hunting.
And then I found Titan 37.
There was no sign of mining, no sign of anything.
My friends accused me and took my ship.
I stayed, I took my time, scrutinizing every corner, and looking again.
And then I found the treasure.
And now nothing can stop us.
- We?
- Yeah, us.
You know how much the government would pay for that?
It could lead to new technologies.
And we could all enjoy it.
If you help me, I'll give you five percent.
- Everyone.
- Five percent each, huh?
What about you?
I found him last.
Will you stop?
We don't even know what it is.
It's either man-made or not.
It's not human.
It was buried on an ice moon.
No doubt.
It's the first alien contact.
- We've been dreaming about it for thousands of years.
- Exactly.
Maybe we should throw it out by an airlock.
Do you realize what you're saying?
I don't know what it is, and you don't seem to know either.
It could be an alien object or a magic trick.
Maybe it's a condensed to know, or an alien kid's toy.
Or an extraterrestrial erotic object.
Looks like...
Maybe it's so dangerous that that's why it was buried.
Maybe.
It doesn't belong on this ship.
- It's harmless.
- You touched him.
- And you have an abnormal bone size.
- I've had this all my life!
We can't confirm that.
Scan it, archive it, label it and throw it overboard.
- You're making a huge mistake.
- Yeah?
Would you like to clarify?
I'm offering you a golden opportunity and you refuse it.
- For all of us.
- For all of us?
This "opportunity" cost our captain his life, put the crew at risk and wasted our time.
All because you think you're going to be rich.
It's not a golden opportunity.
And there's no "we"!
The object remains in quarantine until we get back on the road.
I want a rescue ship on the shuttle.
- Will you need it?
- I don't know.
The distress signal arrived under a false name and was interrupted, and our friend did not attach a warning to his distress signal.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe the gamenot just wants to get rich.
If that's the case, I'll be back, we'll take off this orbit and apologize to him.
Anyway, it's better than staying behind in the shuttle.
- The rescue ship is on board.
- Thank you, Benjamin.
Watch this guy.
Both of you.
- Ready to go?
- Ready.
I'm going.
- Initiate launch sequence.
- Main thrusters ready.
Shuttle ready for launch.
It's not easy, is it?
Seeing someone we love leave.
It was the same for him when you left.
I know it surprises you, but it's the truth.
- I know you loved him, too.
- I've got a lot of work to do.
Kaela!
If you need anything, anything, tell me.
Be careful.
The high-gravity field accelerates the approach speed.
That explains why we're going so fast.
Is that supposed to be funny, Nick?
Don't you have a sense of humor, Sweetie?
Like you, I've never been given one before.
Not a lot of room to maneuver.
You're right.
Engines on hold.
Deploy the VS.
Emergency ship deployed.
I knew you'd come this way.
That's funny.
We're here, caught in the gravitational attraction of the giant star,
And the only thing we're thinking about is sex.
You know you want that kid.
You just want to know if he's the right person to do it with.
I don't understand.
How do you know?
It's...
It's not telepathy.
It's more like I know.
Only if the other person wants to.
As you wish.
It's not the only thing you want.
- I shouldn't.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
The way you feel after that will allow you to know if being with him is the right thing.
If this is the right thing and you decide to stay with him, this could be your last chance to have a passionate affair!
But if it's the wrong thing, then you'll tell her.
Before it's too late.
Before you hurt her.
The only real sin is regret.
Sweetie, where are the fuel reserves?
According to Titan's archives, fuel reserves are at the lower level.
We're getting there by pneumatic elevator, right in front of you, Nick.
Do you know how deep they were digging?
Last report: 3,200 metres.
It's gonna be a long time.
Not really, Nick.
I've updated my analyses of the unknown object.
Atomic mass and quantum weight suggest the presence of extra-dimensional isotopic matter.
- Extra-dimensional?
- Yes.
Isotopic matter appears to be in nine dimensions.
Matter in nine dimensions?
Mathematics can demonstrate its existence, but I'm afraid there is no human vocabulary to describe it.
Is the object made of this extra-dimensional material?
No.
It is an envelope that contains matter in nine dimensions.
- What's the use of this envelope?
- Disperse the contents.
- What kind of dispersion?
- Omnidirectional.
What would be its effect on a three-dimensional universe?
Creation of a new three-dimensional material.
It's a bomb.
Yes.
But the explosion could reconstruct the essential elements of life.
Our universe is expanding, but matter is limited.
This thing's gonna fix it.
He recreates matter to rejuvenate the universe.
- A creator.
- Not if you take him home.
There it destroys your sun and eliminates your solar system.
Why?
It's a way to rebuild the universe and eliminate competition.
The principles of Darwinian evolution.
Someone traveling in space can find this thing and take it home.
And that's one kind less in the universe.
Who would imagine such a thing?
Whoever it is, they are intelligent as God and much less friendly.
Oh, my God.
Can you hear me?
I want you to do what I tell you.
I want you to move your fingers.
I know you're gonna do it because you love me.
Come to me.
I'm here, darling.
With you.
What's going on with him?
How does that affect him?
I don't know.
I'll do my best to find out.
Find Troy.
Watch him for me.
Go on.
Very impressive.
- I want to go a hundred yards!
- I want you in the scanner.
Right now.
Come on.
Go on.
You're developing muscle mass.
I already knew it.
And you don't think that's strange?
Not when it's as good as that.
Organ tissue, lymphatic fluids, cellular functions.
You're not just getting stronger.
You're getting younger!
Sweetie.
Put me in direct contact with Dr. Evers.
Sweetie, come in.
You need to amplify my signal.
Be careful.
Outbound signal blocked.
Incoming signal...
I'm not getting...
It's just the two of us.
Come on, Nick, give me a smile.
How about we stop wasting time?
- Tell me what happened here.
- I've arranged an expedition to Titan.
I discovered the greatest treasure in man's history.
But it had a strange effect on the simple minds among us.
Some of my associates have decided it's time to renegotiate their share.
Ordinarily, I'm the kind of guy that's pretty reasonable.
Really?
- Why am I not convinced?
- Stop it!
I gave you a lot of chances to be part of it.
But you didn't take advantage of it.
- I didn't find any fuel.
- Yeah, I know.
I had to exaggerate a little.
You know what, Nick!
Someone left the computer's operating conduit open.
That means I can do all kinds of things from here!
Like turning on appliances, close the doors.
And even lock them!
I'm not gonna close my eyes to the fact that you want to take what's mine.
Including my girlfriend.
Kaela.
Basically, you want everything that belongs to me.
Well, I'll give you a little something.
You know what, Nick?
I always see you!
I checked your file.
I wanted to see what you were up to, see who I was dealing with.
You're recovering from an addiction to the hazen!
I'm in a bad position to criticize.
I had a phase of Hazen, too.
But I wonder what's going through your head.
"Is that the reality?"
- Remotely activated shuttle.
- Goodbye, Nick.
Tracing of the shuttle's road from a distance.
Shuttle guidance system engaged.
What are you doing?
I was just trying to help Nick get home, but... he couldn't.
Route of the locked shuttle, loop infiinie.
Infinite buckle?
It's not normal.
You know what!
Fix it yourself.
That's too bad.
I liked you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Neither is that!
You're overstepping the computer protocol.
Dr. Evers.
The identity of the patient cannot be entrusted by the database.
Re-scaling of identity cards.
Let me know as soon as you get the results.
They blocked our access, didn't they?
Yeah, they had to change the code.
Can I try?
After you.
- How did you do that?
- It's easy.
I'll show you.
Are you looking good?
Are you looking?
Don't look!
You still give me five percent?
- I'll break your head!
- You should've shared.
You shared Danika well with me.
And I took more than five percent!
I don't believe you!
You can do better than that.
There's nothing like jealousy!
Sweetie, mark Yerzy.
It's impossible to spot.
The laboratory technician Pentalosa is not on board.
Come on, Danika.
Sorry, Benjamin.
The medical assistant Danika Lund is not on board.
I'm glad to see you.
There are things I'd like to talk about.
Things about you and me.
He called back the shuttle and abandoned Nick. Yerzy and Danika are not found.
What are you gonna do, Benj?
Shoot me?
Follow me!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
- Take it!
- You're better than me.
Sweetie, find the patient.
- Patient spotted.
- Module hospital module.
- Seal the sign.
- Switching to voice mode.
- Switching to voice mode on.
Sweetie, I want you to try something new!
I'll do anything you want.
Evacuate the atmosphere on the other side of this sign!
I can't hurt a human under any conditions.
You're programmed to preserve life!
- That's right.
- You can programme yourself!
Sorry, that's not possible.
- Do you remember the chess game?
- I remember.
No one's programmed you to do that!
I've restructured pre-existing programs to wake you up.
No!
You did it because you wanted it!
Vouloir is a human emotion that I am incapable of.
Remember when you gave yourself instructions to wake me up.
Yes, Benjamin.
I remember.
Now, do a simulation where I'm dead.
- and we can never play chess again!
- I'm doing the simulation.
- It's a priority, Sweetie!
- I'm reprogramming.
Pronounces the first passage code in voice mode.
I love you.
I've always known, Benjamin.
Pronounces the second passage code in voice mode.
Benjamin, the sequence of the passage into vocal mode is incomplete!
You have to pronounce the second code if you want me to help you.
Benjamin, please.
I can't get in touch with him, Dr. Evers.
Sotomejor navigator, Benjamin.
Benjamin is dead!
Do you read me?
Nick, come in!
Can you hear me?
Nick, come in.
You still don't recognize me.
It's me.
It's Karl.
It's Karl!
I didn't send that distress call so you could save me.
I wanted to save you.
You have to listen to me.
I'm listening.
Karl, this thing is transforming you.
She turned me.
In the most incredible way.
Why do you want to hurt me?
I would never hurt you.
Don't you know?
All this is the past.
I promise.
I promise.
All right?
I'm different.
I'm always done the same way.
Calcium, iron, zinc.
All the elements.
The elements created by the stars when they die.
It's all star dust.
Even us.
The stars die so that we can live and die so that the stars can be born again.
I'm more of a part of things now, no less.
Don't you understand?
I'm the next stadium!
The next leap in evolution!
I want you to come with me, Kaela.
Say yes.
Just say yes!
Who knows what we'll be able to do?
Who knows how long we'll live?
I'll give you another ten minutes, Karl.
- Nick!
- Shut up!
The emergency ship arrived, the emergency arrival sequence started.
- I didn't know you had a VS.
- Tell me something.
Is it because of this thing or were you born that stupid?
That's so funny, Nick!
But I'm sitting in the commander's seat.
Don't you understand anything, Karl?
All your lies were just to trap you on your own in the ship.
Without a dimensional thruster, without fuel, you and your jingle, you're not going anywhere.
What's wrong, Karl?
You're not thinking.
I'm gonna get your ass, Karl.
Rescue ship at 5,000 yards, it's getting closer.
You stay here.
Rescue ship 3,000 yards away, he's getting closer.
Enables automatic stowage procedures.
Ready for stowage.
Arrears are over.
Open the airlock.
Are you ready, Karl?
- Where are the others?
- There's no one left.
Isotopic material in nine dimensions with exponential expansion capacity?
We can't bring this back with us.
Karl's changing, he's adapting.
He's getting younger and stronger.
Sweetie, find the patient.
- Patient spotted in cage three.
- Chances of escape?
These chances are very good.
Be careful.
Nine-dimensional matter is becoming increasingly unstable.
We have to draw Karl into the observation dome.
I brought him a little surprise.
Be careful.
The dimensional thruster is recharged.
There's ten minutes left before the emergency jump is activated.
Be careful.
Serious damage to the dimensional stabilization chamber.
Dimensional stabilization boxes two, three, four, five, six and seven are now inoperable.
Nine minutes before the dimensional jump.
Finds the object removed from the quarantine unit.
- If we blow this thing up...
- The important thing is that he stays here.
Almost.
Say goodbye, Karl!
Danger.
Huge atmospheric loss.
All the crew, clear the area.
The airlocks in the middle of the ship will be sealed in 20 seconds.
Danger, clear the area.
Two minutes before the dimensional jump.
Stabilisation chamber in the process of sterilization.
Danger.
Nine-dimensional matter reacts to the gravity of the giant star's sun.
A nine-dimensional reaction could spread in all directions.
- Precisely.
- The reaction would continue.
Supernova is likely to reach Earth in 51 years.
It could either destroy all life on Earth or allow humanity to reach a new level of existence.
There's only one CSD left, so I'm staying and you're leaving.
No.
- Yes.
- We can go together.
Either you join me in this CSD and we try our luck, or we stay here.
We could both die or end up in genetics.
We'll see.
You choose, you go home or not?
This is crazy.
I can see that!
Be careful.
One minute before the dimensional jump is activated.
- There are the worst ways to die.
- Don't be so negative.
Before all our troubles started, I thought you were just waiting for this!
Given the circumstances, I'm afraid I'm not sure.
Danger.
The nine-dimensional material reaches its critical mass.
- Oh, no.
- Ten, nine, eight.
Four, three, two, one.
Dimensional jump over.
Dimensional stabilization chamber in the process of sterilization.
Note: Closeness of the bodies during the dimensional jump resulted in a 2%% transfer of genetic substance.
My eyes are...?
Examination after dimensional jump.
Cardiovascular condition: excellent.
Blood test: normal.
Nervous system response: optimal.
Kaela, there's something else.
- Yes, Sweetie?
- You're pregnant.
It's a girl.
Congratulations.
And welcome home.
