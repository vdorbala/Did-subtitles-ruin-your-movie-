- Dad, are you awake?
- Yes.
It's time to get up.
- Already in the morning?
- Yes!
I gotta get up.
I've got a little hollow.
You want your glasses?
Yeah, on the pillow there.
Your breakfast, Dad.
Perfect.
It looks delicious.
Do you want anything else?
A biscotta, coffee?
No, no coffee this morning.
Orange juice, maybe.
- If you need anything, call.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hey.
- How's your mother?
- It's okay.
Is she working?
No, she still hasn't found anything.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Good, how about you?
- Great.
What can I get you?
I'll get a doughnut.
- On the spot or take away?
- On the spot.
I'd like to take a picture.
If you want.
You're my best friend.
I need a picture of my best friend.
Where am I going?
It's almost too good to get in there, isn't it?
Come on, let's go.
I talked to Judy yesterday.
She told me about the big order to come.
We're going to have to increase production.
- Great!
- You bet!
- It's hard enough already.
- Okay with you.
They should hire, don't you think?
So, tonight, can you take me to my other job, to the excavator factory?
You know I do.
I've always told you that if you need it, you just have to ask.
That's nice.
You're welcome.
Have you been out a little lately?
Not in a while.
- Nothing in sight?
- No, I work a lot.
Between here and my other job, I don't have much time.
Like all of us, I can tell you.
And I'm gonna have to work at night, so to get out at night, I'll have to have a day off.
I'd be fine at the sea.
I want to go to Aruba.
It was on TV the other day.
The beaches are great.
I'm done.
What about you?
Yeah, I'm gonna go smoke one.
Have you talked to your dad lately?
Not since the last time.
It must have been... six months.
Where does he live now?
I think he's remarried.
I haven't heard from you since.
...have approved the sum of $29,000 to maintain Roseanne Buell's Social Assistant.
Nearly 22,000 baby boomers in West Virginia are without social security as retirement approaches.
A study by Marshall University says that 75% of all respondents believe they are healthy or...
What about the job?
How'd you do?
It's okay.
Are you hungry?
No, I don't think so.
- I'm going to bed.
- All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Ready for your first day?
- Oh, yes.
- Not even a little nervous?
- No, I'm fine.
Good.
So, you know how to use an airbrush?
I was painting t-shirts in the gallery.
And you were working with other painters, or were you waiting for the customers?
I was working alone.
They gave me the equipment, they gave me the orders, and I took care of it.
It's perfect.
Let's go.
Good morning, everyone.
You all know we got a big order, and we're working hard to honor it, but we thought you might need some help.
Well, this is Rose.
We're very lucky to have found her, because she knows how to handle the airbrush, and she's already worked in the stencil.
So she'll be at the head painting workshop.
I'm counting on you to answer his questions.
During her interview, I found Rose very nice, and perfect for teamwork. She will surely find her place among you.
I count on you to introduce him to the house and to give him all the necessary help.
Let's get to work.
You have to stick them twice before you pack them.
I know.
One of you smokes?
- Not me.
- I do.
Really?
You finish this and we're gonna get some cigarettes?
All right.
Where were you working before?
In a nursing home.
And what were you doing there?
Professional torchist.
The lowest level, caregiving.
The one we call for the gross stuff, that was my job.
Taking care of people for them, doing whatever they can't do, showering them, dressing them, feeding them.
Depends on the people, on what to do.
It's a dirty job and you have to have a vocation.
If we don't like what we're doing, we can't live.
There are days when we really... we only have one idea, it's to turn the heels.
It wasn't that hard, but... I don't feel able to love it any longer.
What about you?
What was the question?
Where were you working before?
I was doing maintenance in an old factory.
That's cool.
I'm about to leave here.
Why is that?
It's dead around here.
I live in a small apartment with my two-year-old daughter.
There's no money to make around here.
It's poor.
Everything's so poor.
Are you married?
No, I'm not married.
I guess I should've, but it doesn't always work the way we want it to.
I mean.
Another bad choice.
What are you doing after work?
I'm definitely gonna... go home, see my dad.
Could you drop me off somewhere?
- My other job, I have to be there fast, but it's not too far.
- All right.
- I'd really like that.
Don't worry.
You're almost done?
Pretty much.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette, and we're gonna be back in a while.
All right.
Is that it?
Rose?
Where are you?
In the bathroom.
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
I'm taking a bath.
Do you do this often?
Not every time.
You know, I was working in a nursing home.
I remember.
An old man hit my back with a rolling tray.
I couldn't wear Jesse for a month.
At times, I have contractures and it's very painful.
That's good for me.
And I don't have a bathtub at home.
I just have a shower, so I take advantage of it, but I clean it up after.
I was wondering...
What if we get caught?
No, she won't be back anytime soon.
Oh, my God!
Every room is as big as my living room.
The rooms...
My whole house would be in two of those rooms.
I couldn't believe it.
Beautiful!
They have chandeliers on the ceiling.
It was unreal.
I mean, fabulous.
And then... you're not gonna believe it.
She told me this lady was very special.
She brought me into that house where she cleans up.
Guess.
She was in the jacuzzi.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
- She was supposed to clean up.
- She was distracted.
- Seriously, I didn't believe it.
I thought I'd die imagining the lady coming in and surprise us.
Me, nothing to do here, but visiting the house, and Rose in the bathtub.
And then I thought, "Wow!"
I'd have freaked out they'd be coming home sooner.
I don't really feel it.
- What do you think?
I don't know.
I think she's good.
You think?
She scares me a little bit.
I worked in a restaurant open day and night, with two teams.
I had no one to take care of him.
It was hard, but I didn't want to put him in the house.
- It's so expensive.
- And what places!
We'd have to put them there only if we had to.
- Really?
- They often lack staff or equipment.
There are people who should not be there, who should be placed elsewhere, who are violent.
You never know what we're gonna find there, or what roommate they're gonna get.
It's not...
They don't always put in the same room people who have the same problems, like the aphasics together.
Some are graffiti, others can walk.
They search the neighbor's stuff or tear them apart.
I'm glad I didn't.
And the management...
They're so short of arms.
You see, we point, but if they see you in the parking lot, they call you, "Come help me for a minute, for this or this."
And you're good for an extra hour.
And that, two or three times a week, without being paid more.
But you want to keep your job, so you don't say anything.
You got it in the c...
You don't want to bother anybody, do you?
- And they do it to everyone.
- Really?
So everyone does.
That would be unthinkable here.
If we did the quotas, we got bonuses, did you know that?
No, not at all.
We can earn $50 if we reach the quota of the week.
I think that's great.
That's great of them.
Yeah, that would help me with some bills.
Is that what you'd spend it on?
I guess I...
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.
How would you spend it?
If the weather keeps going, I'd buy some camping.
Nice idea.
If you want to make some money, I was going out this weekend.
You could keep Jesse for a few hours.
I can't give you much, but it'll be that.
- What night?
- Friday.
If it's good for you.
- Yeah, I can do that for you.
- Really?
She's nice.
- How old is she?
- Two years.
It'll be good for him to see someone else, too.
She doesn't see a lot of people.
What does she like to do?
She loves coloring and reading books.
And she goes to bed around 8:00, most often.
That way I'll be able to sew later.
- Of course.
- All right.
- I'm really happy.
Are you done?
Almost.
- Are we gonna smoke a cigarette?
- Yeah.
I won't be back until 11:00. I left you a number, to reach me if you need anything.
- I was just wondering.
- I left it for you.
I did.
She should go to bed in half an hour, around 8:00.
A quarter of an hour before, you put her in bed, with some biscuits and fruit juice, that she doesn't have an empty stomach.
It's okay.
Wait for her to cry, see me go.
You just have to go to bed and read her a book.
She'll take her blanket, suck her thumb, and that's it.
All right.
Sounds perfect.
She's pretty quiet.
What's that?
Who could it be?
Be careful.
- Hey, come in.
- Hey, come in.
- Hello.
Come on, honey.
Who's that?
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, nothing.
So he's your date?
We're going out tonight.
And who's gonna drive?
I borrowed a friend's car.
He's leaving her for the party.
I see.
Can I have a kiss?
Mom's leaving for a while.
Are you okay?
- No!
- Yes, I do!
- I want my baby!
- All right, take it.
We're gonna go right now.
- What's that?
- Another baby.
Take it to sleep with it.
- I love you.
- Mom, I want to come.
No, you stay here, with Martha.
You're going to have a good time.
Come here, honey.
Let's read a story, will you?
- No!
- Here's a very nice book.
See, she's gonna read you a book.
I'll be right back.
Come on, give me a kiss.
I want to come with you.
- Would you take it?
- I want to come!
Come on, honey.
- You want to play a little?
Come on!
Oh, honey.
See, every time I save a little, something's going on, Jesse gets sick.
Do you have a little side?
A little bit.
I don't have a bank account, but I have a well-filled drawer.
A drawer, huh?
He has his apartment, and Jesse lives with me.
He wasn't ready for a baby.
He's an artist, he's very focused on his work, on himself.
He doesn't have time for anyone else.
But he's helping me a little.
He keeps it from time to time, if available.
That's good.
At least he's around and he sees her.
Yeah, he's trying.
So you're done with your high school?
No, actually, I was worried and I had to stop.
What do you mean?
As soon as there were too many people around me, I became nervous, and sometimes I panicked.
Really?
It was enough to stop.
Did you see a doctor?
I saw it, for a while, but all those pills didn't have any effect, so I decided to stop, and I decided to take care of myself.
Anyway, there's nothing to do.
Are you still taking some?
And you're okay?
Are you still suffering from it?
It's better now.
Where I'm going, there's rarely 400 people, like in high school.
It's only when there's a lot of people.
When it happens to me, it doesn't last.
What about you, high school?
I quit, too.
Because of what?
- I was a rebel.
Oh, yes.
I got off on a stop to Charleston.
- How old were you?
- 15 years.
- Dangerous, huh?
- Yeah, a little.
It was fun, at the same time.
And look now.
I'd like to save for a car.
It's nice to have one.
Where do you live?
With my mom right now.
- No joke?
- It's just a matter of money.
It's the best way to save money.
I'm surprised.
Is your mom home?
Actually, I don't know.
Don't you think we'd rather go?
Why not?
They're beautiful.
Your mom likes jewelry.
Look at this.
- He's pretty.
- Oh, it fell.
- It's a giraffe.
- A giraffe.
Oh, yes.
It's like a dinosaur.
It's a giraffe-dinosaur.
- What's that?
- A purple necklace.
- Is that a purple necklace?
- Yes.
Mom, this is Rose.
- Hey, Rose.
You okay?
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
She was the one they hired at the factory the other day.
Kyle told me about you.
- Really?
Yes.
So, how do you find that?
I've had worse.
It's a catch, but, well, it's a job.
It's often like that.
You want to watch this?
That's nice.
No, we're gonna stay in the room for a while.
- See you later.
- See you.
Very interesting, your room.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's a tattoo that a friend drew for me.
He's doing tattoos and stuff.
It throws it away.
Yeah, that's cool.
I like it.
Do you have tattoos?
Yeah, I got two on my arms.
- Are they the same?
- Yeah, they're symmetrical.
That's cool.
Do you want more?
I'm probably gonna make one last one of those.
But he'll find something else to offer me.
A friend of mine, Marietta, made one behind my back.
I'm not ready for another.
Did it hurt you?
No, it didn't hurt.
Don't make a mistake, it's forever.
- Yeah.
- See?
Yeah, it's final.
You like hanging out in tatoo shops?
Yeah, I have some tattoo friends.
That's nice.
We meet a lot of people.
- Great show, where did you get it?
- Thank you.
A gift from a person I was cleaning at.
Some kind of tip?
- More like a big thank you.
- Nice of them.
Really nice.
You look like you're reading High Times.
Are you smoking?
- Yeah, I'm a smoker.
- I knew it.
Each has its own flaws.
Your mother's mad at us if we smoked here?
We could make sure she doesn't know.
I don't want her to stick her nose around here.
I get it.
I think we can go.
That's cool.
Would you like something to drink?
That'd be good.
Do you have beer?
Yeah, I got beer.
I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.
- Oh, thin!
- What?
It's getting late.
I have to get Jesse back.
I told Martha we wouldn't be long.
I'll leave it to you, save it for later.
Okay, I'll keep it for another time.
All we have to do is drink the beer before we leave.
Great, that's cool.
I don't want to come in because of Martha, all this.
Because of Martha?
I wasn't comfortable earlier.
- To go out with me?
I don't know.
That or something.
She just gave me bad vibrations.
No problem.
- I had a good time.
- I'll do it, too.
Look, you're calling me back.
- All right.
- See you on Monday at work.
- I'll see you later.
- Hey.
So, what's your date?
That was great.
I wish I'd been warned.
Notifyed of what?
That you were going out together.
- Why?
- I felt stupid.
Oh, sorry.
- What about Jesse?
- That was great.
- How'd it go?
- Yes.
She loves her necklaces.
Oh, yes.
That's something.
She went to bed like you said.
With the juice and the biscuits.
Guess what.
Guess what happened in my house.
What do you want?
A little money, a bag of grass... and the truth is all.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, right.
- What?
- Everything that's gone from my house!
- Where the fuck did it go?
- I'm out.
- I didn't go to your house.
He's cute.
- It's none of your business.
- Then take his money from him.
- I don't want to see you here.
- Then don't come to my house.
I didn't come to sting at you.
I don't have anything to do with you.
You have my car, which does you good.
- I need it!
- Because I don't?
I'm walking Jesse, I'm shopping, I'm buying her her fucking Happy Meals.
I can't do it without my money.
I don't have your money.
I don't have your fucking money, Jake!
You can search, he's not here.
There's no money, and there's no grass.
- It's childish.
- You're a real kid.
There's only Jake and his little desires.
- I don't have your shit.
- I need my money.
- Sell your shit, you'll get some money.
As a matter of principle?
You come to my house, you knock on my door in the middle of the night, you falsely accuse me.
Pick it up right now.
Pick you up and give me back my money.
Unless you've spent everything.
For Jesse, at least?
- Did you buy her clothes?
- Get out of my house!
I'm sorry.
- Is that Jesse's father?
- Listen...
Martha, take care of your business.
Read your magazine.
Hello, Sergeant.
Detective Taylor.
- Sergeant Davis.
- What do we got?
A neighbor called at 6:45 a.m. to say that a child had been screaming all night.
As no one answered, she called Police-Secours.
When we got to the scene, we came in.
We found a 23-year-old woman in the living room, named Rose Hilliard.
- Any signs of break-in?
- None.
- Robbery?
- It doesn't sound like it.
- Traces of wrestling?
- It seems so.
Let's take a look.
Dad, your breakfast.
That's very nice of you.
- Do we have cereal this morning?
- Cereals and fruit juice.
You were right.
There's no sign of a break-in in the apartment.
It's not a robbery, either.
Bags and valuables are intact.
Contusions to the neck, signs of manual strangulation.
Eye petechiae.
- Where's the baby?
- With her grandmother.
- Is she okay?
Ross, when you make the prints, make some marks on her neck too.
Yes, sir.
Let's see what the neighbors know.
Officer Smeeks?
Tell us what you learned.
I talked to three neighbors.
Mom, wouldn't you have taken money from my room?
I didn't go to your room.
- I didn't see anything.
- All right.
You had to spend more than you expected.
I put it away a little bit, I had to put it somewhere else.
I wanted to make sure you didn't take it.
No, I didn't.
I didn't see anything.
- Was there a lot?
- Just a little in case of an emergency.
It's a ring my mother gave me.
When I was 30, she thought I was mature enough to keep her.
- A sentimental object, then?
And here's my grandmother's brooch, it's transmitted from mother to daughter, my mom thought she had it, but I got it.
- Guess where that came from.
- Where's that from?
Found in the park with a metal detector.
- Nice catch.
- That's what I thought.
Jake?
Police.
Detective Taylor.
I need to talk to you.
- Do you have to?
- It's pretty important.
I need to talk to you about Rose Hilliard.
All right, man.
Come in.
It's this way.
- Walls, is that you?
- Most of them.
- Very interesting.
- I hear so.
How long have you known Rose?
We've known each other for a while...
We stayed together for at least a year and a half.
All understood, it's been five years.
Do you have a child together?
- Yeah.
- What's your daughter's name?
When was the last time you saw Rose?
- What day is it?
Last night.
- You were at her house last night?
- Yeah, Friday night.
Do you remember the time?
About 11:00.
It was late, she was coming back from a date.
Why were you there?
Because that idiot stole money from me.
- You wanted to talk to him?
- Yeah, I talked to him.
Was there anyone else?
There was a girl on the couch.
Do you know this person?
No idea.
What did she look like?
Someone on a couch.
I don't know.
- You didn't see well.
- No, man.
Did you tell Rose about that stolen money?
- Of course!
- You had a fight?
I don't know.
We talk like this all the time.
- Just tell me...
- Yeah!
I wanted her to give me my money back!
She didn't want to give it back to me, or even admit she had it.
You yelled at each other?
No, the little girl was sleeping upstairs.
What happened?
I asked him where my money was.
As usual, she said, "I don't have it, it's not me."
She told me to get out of here and I left.
Do you know why I'm here?
- No, man.
- Rose was murdered.
Any idea who could have done this?
No, not me.
I'm sure of that.
Your apartment is the apartment of someone very passionate.
Artist and passionate.
Not to the point of kicking his ass, otherwise you'd have heard of me before.
- You never assaulted her?
- No, not really.
When you left, was everything okay?
I wouldn't say everything was fine, but she seemed to be breathing, talking and standing.
When you were there, you didn't have a physical altercation with her?
No, man...
Is she dead?
She's dead.
I've got people to call right now.
I need to see my daughter.
For dark water, dark bait. It sounds silly, but if you go fishing in very clear water, prefer the light colors.
There's a lock.
And the little lockers you put anywhere you want.
That's nice.
And how much is that?
$18.95.
- Kyle?
You should get out.
There's someone for you.
- Who's that?
- A cop.
How long have you known Rose?
About a week.
What kind of relationship do you have?
We're colleagues and friends.
We just met.
- Have you seen Rose lately?
- I was with her last night.
What did you do?
We went out for a few beers, and we came back here for a while, and then I brought her back.
Was there anyone else?
No.
What time did you drop it off?
About 11:00.
While you were together, did she tell you about anyone who would have wanted her?
Did something happen to her?
She was murdered last night.
- What?
- She was killed.
- Where?
- At her house.
You know who could blame him?
No, she didn't tell me.
What time did you pick her up last night?
About six or seven o'clock.
- Did you get in her house?
- Yeah, I came in.
Was there anyone else?
There was Martha, to keep her daughter.
- Who's Martha?
Is she reddish?
Yeah.
I sewed doll clothes.
- What did you do?
- I sewed some clothes for the dolls.
I like it.
- And you're doing this on your own?
- Yes, on your own.
My dad's home, I spend some time with him.
He's watching TV while I'm sewing.
Is Kyle here?
Yeah.
Can I come in?
- Come in.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Great.
- Yeah.
Very nice.
Wait a minute, I'll let Kyle know.
Kyle, Martha's here.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- Hey, what were you doing?
- Hey, Martha.
- I tried to reach you.
- I've been out all day.
Hairdressing salon and some errands.
- Haven't we told you yet?
- About what?
About Rose.
What, Rose?
We killed her last night.
She was murdered, strangled.
- No.
- Yes.
- Last night?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
A detective came today.
It's a joke.
He came here to tell us, and asked me a lot of questions.
And that happened last night?
They questioned me because I'd be the last one to see her alive.
- So I told him that you...
- I was there when you brought her back.
You're not gonna believe me.
That night, after you dropped her off, a guy started knocking on her door, she goes, she opens, and this guy gets mad.
And when you left, was she okay?
Of course she was fine.
But if he was waiting outside, when you dropped him off, he was probably waiting for me to leave.
And he went back.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.
- It happened so fast.
- Sure.
Here, it's for you.
Oh, thank you.
- Thank you, Martha.
- You're welcome, really.
- You should call that detective.
- Yeah, give me his number.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Martha.
Detective Taylor.
I need to talk to you about Rose Hilliard.
- May I come in?
- Of course, come in.
Kyle told me Rose was murdered.
- Can I sit down?
This is my father.
Sir, I'm from the police.
I just want to talk to your daughter.
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, sir.
At first, I found her charming.
But when you know her better, she's always going further, and she's always asking for more.
We had to do him a favor after service.
- Did she take advantage of you?
- A little, yes.
She did this to other people?
I'm not sure.
She's been pretty hard on me.
She didn't really sympathize with the other employees.
She's only been here a week.
According to the neighbourhood statements, you'd be the last one to be seen leaving the scene.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know, I had to leave after he did this.
Besides, at this stage of the investigation, you're the last one to see her alive.
That's why I'd like to have your fingerprints, to compare them to those found at the scene.
I was there, my prints are there.
Of course, but others can only belong to the killer.
Could you come to the police station and get your fingerprints?
I just need to find someone to take care of my father.
How long will it take?
No more than 15 or 20 minutes to take the prints.
If we could do it tonight, it'd push the investigation forward.
I'm willing to do anything to help you.
- Hello, Martha.
Thank you for meeting me again.
I have a few more questions.
- All right.
Do you mind if I record our conversation?
- No.
- Good.
Let's go, I'll start the tape.
I'd like you to review Friday night's events.
Do you remember what time Kyle came to pick her up?
Not at all.
Did Kyle come in?
- Yes.
- How long did he stay?
No, they...
They talked a little, and...
They didn't stay long.
- Do you know where they went?
So they left you and the girl alone?
- And what did you do with the party?
I played with the girl, watched TV, read some magazines, gave her her juice, and she went to bed.
Rose told me it would be quick, and she was very wise.
- Nothing unusual?
- No.
What time did Rose get home?
About 11:00.
And you left right away?
No, she asked me how it happened, and I asked her how her date went.
And there's this man who knocked on the door.
Did you tell me that an individual came in, his ex?
Yeah, I guess he was sitting outside waiting for him.
- Did they fight?
- Pretty much, yes.
You already told me they had a fight.
Tell me more about it.
He said she stole things from her apartment, and money.
Did they come to their hands?
Well, they screamed pretty good... and I'm not sure he pushed her, but she grabbed him to put him out.
Could she have kicked him out?
It took a while.
But he ended up leaving the apartment?
- Yes.
- Did you see him that night?
No.
I took my car and left.
- Where to?
- Right at home.
I talked to your father the other night, and he confirmed your time of return.
Is there anything else you could tell me?
What really bothered me was that he was waiting for her out there.
What if he's still here after I'm gone?
When I was at your house, you told me you were ready to do anything to help us in this investigation?
That's right.
So start by telling me really what happened.
That's what I do.
We got the lab results, which involve you in Rose Hilliard's death.
I don't see how.
We found your fingerprints on the swabs on his neck.
I don't understand.
This is your only chance to get away with it.
Either you killed in cold blood, which I don't think, or something happened that caused you to do that.
It's you, no doubt.
But you can at least explain to me what happened.
I can't...
I don't understand.
Can you explain to me the presence of your fingerprints on his neck?
No, sir.
Neighbors saw you leaving the apartment last time.
We have proof.
You'll be condemned for that.
You have to tell me the truth about what happened.
I don't know.
Jurors won't believe a word of it.
Look at these photographs.
That's what she looks like.
That's what you did to him.
Jurors won't be happy if you don't show any remorse.
There is certainly a reason for all this.
Maybe a fight, words go beyond thought.
You know that.
She can't say anything.
- I can't have done that.
- It's you, though.
No, sir.
No.
Mr. Hightower, I'm here to explain what's going on.
I was just wondering.
I just talked to Martha, and given this interview, and the evidence found at the scene, she was arrested for the murder of Rose Hilliard.
Really?
I wanted to warn you about what was going on because you're his loved ones.
Yes.
Currently, she is incarcerated until a date is chosen for the hearing.
Oh, my God.
It's sad to hear that.
Do you have any questions?
When will the hearing take place?
Probably very soon.
A lawyer will be assigned to him.
Hey, Martha.
Hey, Kyle.
Good to see you.
It's horrible here.
Ah?
So, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
I don't even know why I'm here, actually.
They think I killed her.
Kyle, you know me.
I can't have done that.
He's probably Jesse's father.
I can't...
I don't know what happened.
You gotta help me, Kyle.
You know I would never do such a thing.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
And it looks like the detective...
They think it's me, but I don't see how.
I don't see how that's possible.
I don't know, Martha.
I don't understand.
I don't even know what I did.
I know I had a very big headache, and when he started yelling, I wanted to go home.
I didn't know who it was, and when I wanted to ask her, she told me to get involved.
And it really disappointed me, and I thought I could talk to her like I did to my daughter.
After all, she had entrusted me with her most precious possession: her daughter.
And all the services she asked me for.
It wasn't an exaggeration to ask him who it was.
She was in all her states, she didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know, Martha.
You gotta help me, Kyle.
I don't know what I can do.
- I don't know what happened.
- We need to find out.
It's not me, Kyle.
I can't have done that.
Yeah.
I don't know, Martha.
- I don't understand.
- Neither do I.
Good morning, everyone.
We've all been through terrible events.
It's...
We need to keep going.
That's why we hired Kyle's mother, Helen, knowing that she can't... replace them both because one of them was with us a long time ago and the other recently, but worked very well,
But we think... even if Kyle's mom doesn't have much experience, you can work with her, and help her progress as quickly as possible.
Hello.
Show me what to do.
I'll do my best to help you.
Oh, my God.
