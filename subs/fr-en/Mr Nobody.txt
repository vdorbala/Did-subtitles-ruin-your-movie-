Like most living beings, the pigeon combines the button on which it presses with the reward.
But if a seed falls every 20 sec. the pigeon wonders:
"What did I do to deserve this?"
If he beats wings, he will continue, convinced that his action causes events.
It's called the pigeon superstition.
What did I do to deserve this?
How have you been since last time?
- Do I know you?
- See you every week.
I'm Dr. Feldheim.
What about you?
Nobody.
Nemo Nobody.
Not very common as a name, is it?
Sometimes they call me Mr. Craft.
C.R.A.F.T.
Can't Remember A Fucking Thing.
What was my first question?
I don't know.
Can you tell me your age?
I'm 34 years old.
I was born in 1975.
Would you like to look at your hands?
You don't have to.
There's a mirror in front of you.
No... I... I...
What year is it?
In 2009.
I'm 34 years old.
I was born on February 9th...
1975.
In that case...
It's your birthday.
I'm 34 years old.
I'm 34 years old.
I have to wake up!
I have to wake up!
No, Nemo.
The sun hurts my eyes.
Hey, man.
Hello, my little angels.
It's school time.
Come on.
Elise, I'm taking the kids to school!
- Paul, easy.
- My name's not Paul.
Paul?
Dad?
Paul, don't wake your father.
Elise?
It's me, Jeanne.
Am I dead?
Go back to play, Paul.
- Who's Elise?
- I don't know any Elise.
You're tired, Nemo.
You have to rest.
I'll turn on the TV.
I'm going home.
The sun hurts my eyes.
What?
The sun hurts my eyes.
Nemo, your friends are here.
Hello, Nemo.
How are you feeling today?
You know who I am?
We're all very worried about you, Nemo.
Everybody's waiting for you back to the office, real quick.
Mrs. Nobody...
This is Julian Marshall, live from New York Hospital, where we will see the last episode of our series, "The Last Mortels".
Mr. Nobody was 117 years old without having been telenomized.
And without wonderful pignets with compatible strain cells.
Live on WWB, Mr.Nobody will be the last man on Earth to die of old age.
Mr. Nobody.
"The Last Mortel."
So, Doctor, no trace of his identity in the official records.
Nothing about his past.
We don't know who Mr. Nobody is.
And neither did he.
My patient's memory is confused.
But sometimes, at a stage of illness... distant memories come back with great precision...
Let's try something new.
I'm thinking of an old technique.
I can't promise anything.
Maybe a bunch of memories...
Maybe nothing.
Do you agree to try?
You're very relaxed.
You can only hear my voice.
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
Your legs and arms become heavy.
I'll count to three.
When I say "3"... you'll sleep.
One...
Two...
Remember the day you arrived here.
Three.
You're sleeping.
DIRECTIONS
Go up even further in time.
When I say three...
One...
Two...
Three.
Remember.
I can remember long before I was born.
I was waiting with those who were not yet born.
When you're not born, you know everything, everything that's gonna happen.
When your turn comes, the Angel of the Oblivion puts a finger on your mouth.
It leaves a mark on the lip.
It means we've forgotten everything.
But the angels passed me.
Then we have to find a dad and a mom.
It's hard to choose.
Blue-eyed blond.
That's all I'm asking.
- Andrew!
- It's better that the kid isn't alone.
Don't move!
It's normal to think about it at a certain age.
- For a woman.
- That's the meaning...
Life.
I wasn't done, honey.
It's the meaning of life.
- It's not that we want a child...
- But we slept together.
- It's an important experience.
- Yes.
It would help my husband to have a child.
We'd call him Georges.
Well, Georges?
We had a dog, but he died.
Finally, I chose these.
'Cause the lady smelled good
- and the gentleman said...
It was written.
Do you know the butterfly effect?
Once upon a time there was a father and a mother called:
"Dad and Mom."
They found a cute little baby and called it "the cute little baby."
The little baby was born there.
He was born that day and not another.
Her dad and mom live at number seven.
Everything we see exists.
We can see him.
I see Mom's eyes.
But I can't see mine.
The little baby can see his hands, but he can't see himself.
So, does he really exist?
Do I really exist?
A chicken on a wall that picks hard bread
Picoti, picota Lift the tail and jump down
My mom told me to pick the best and it's you.
Mom has a brush for her hair and red for her lips.
She smells good.
Dad has a watch and hair on his arm.
The watch is ticking.
If the baby falls, the mother applauds.
She says "Bravo."
Why am I and not someone else?
And an anticyclone will arrive from the Azores tomorrow and bring a sunny weekend.
Get the barbecues out.
Why do we remember the past and not the future?
When you ask Mom, she says:
"Stop asking why.
"It's complicated."
Sir...
It's all right, I'm a journalist.
The hospital forbids interviews.
I just have a few questions.
I have a nurse friend here.
She brought me in.
What time is it?
2.12 p.m.
Where did you come from?
I borrowed it from the university museum.
But it still works.
I have nothing to tell you.
I'm Mr. Nobody.
The man who doesn't exist.
Do you remember the world before Quasi-Immortality?
What?
Telomerization.
The infinite renewal of cells.
How was it when we were mortal?
There were cars that were polluting.
We were smoking cigarettes.
We were eating meat.
We were doing everything that was forbidden here and it was wonderful.
Most of the time, nothing happened.
Like in a French movie.
And... sexually?
Before we don't need sex anymore?
We were fucking.
Everybody was fucking all the time.
We were falling in love.
We were falling in love.
What time is it?
What was there before the Big Bang?
There was no prior, because before the Big Bang... time didn't exist.
What will happen at the end of expansion, when the universe reverses its course?
What will be the nature of time?
If string theory is accurate, the universe has 9 spatial dimensions and a temporal dimension.
We can imagine that at first, all dimensions were twisted.
During the Big Bang, 3 spatial dimensions
- height, width, depth - and time - time
- deployed.
The other six would have remained tiny and wound on themselves.
If we live in a universe with winding dimensions, how can we distinguish between illusion and reality?
The time we know is a dimension that we go only in one direction.
But what if one of the other dimensions was not spatial, but temporal?
If we mix the puree and the sauce, we can't separate them anymore.
It's forever.
Smoke comes out of Dad's cigarette, but never goes back.
We can't go back.
That's why it's hard to choose.
We have to make the right choice.
As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.
- Hey, Nemo.
- Hey, Anna.
- Hey, Nemo.
- Hey, Elise.
- Hey, Nemo.
- Hey, Jeanne.
Thus, Anna and Nemo consent to the sacred bonds of marriage, - taking witness to this assembly...
- So, Elise and Nemo consent to the sacred bonds of marriage...
- Jeanne and Nemo decided to unite.
I pronounce them husband and wife.
Dad says we can predict exactly where Mars will be in the sky, even in 100 years.
What's funny is he doesn't know what's gonna happen to him in two minutes.
Dad!
It's impossible, no one knows the future.
I remember.
We remember the past, not the future.
But I do!
Sometimes I feel like what's happened has already happened.
It's the feeling of already-seen.
- It happens to everyone.
- No, it's the fault of the Angels of the Oblivion!
They didn't put their finger on me.
Come on!
Catch!
Come on!
Should we let Mr. Nobody die of natural death?
Is it necessary to prolong his life artificially?
Vote now!
Type "X" for artificial extension, type "0" to let nature do it.
I'll meet you after this!
You, too, go on holiday on Mars!
Book before the Union Day and save 16,000 units!
Okay, Anna.
Let's go.
Then mom and dad kissed each other all day.
So, Nemo, you made up your mind?
Do you want to go with me or stay with your father?
Nemo!
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Did you follow your father or your mother?
Dad,
- Is it my fault?
- Of course not.
It's my fault.
I can give you a good price on this kind of shoelace.
A very good price.
Remember.
Remember.
Nemo?
Nemo?
It's time to get up, darling.
I'm going to work.
Be on time at school.
Nemo, it's me.
You probably didn't do your homework.
Finish them fast.
I invited someone to dinner.
I'm counting on you to shut her up.
- How was your trip?
- Good.
- Seen any apartments?
- One or two pretty good.
- Nemo, don't stare at people like that.
- It's okay.
It's not a problem.
- He has the art of embarrassing people.
- It's okay.
This will happen on a Saturday.
You'll be driving your car.
You're whistling.
You don't see the crossing.
Suddenly...
A train will pop up from your left and you will be crushed.
You're not funny.
Nemo believes he can predict the future.
That's right.
I predicted Dad's accident.
Maybe you're the one who loosened the brake.
No one can predict the future.
No one knows what will happen.
I do.
Then you could have seen this one coming.
I knew you'd say that.
It's nothing.
I'll call you.
Proud of you?
Why are you destroying everything I...
Don't I have the right to live, too?
You could stay with your father, too.
I'd like to introduce you to a new student.
Anna, go sit down.
Okay, let's go back to page 215.
Yesterday's class.
The climate, vegetation and weather elements that influence them will be discussed.
Five elements constitute the climate we know.
Are you coming for a swim?
- Come on, the water's good.
- No, I...
Come on, they're my friends.
Come on.
They're idiots.
I don't swim with fools.
You bastard.
Why then did I say, "I don't swim with fools"?
How are you?
Good.
What about you?
Yeah, good.
Are these your kids?
See you.
Yeah, I'll see you.
Why then did I say, "I don't swim with fools"?
Are you coming for a swim?
- Come on, the water's good.
- No, I...
- I can't swim.
- Excuse me?
I can't swim.
There you go.
Don't tell anyone.
Hey, are you coming for a swim?
No, I have my period.
I'll stay here.
Nemo will keep me company.
Honey, I want you to meet someone.
You already know Harry and this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.
Then shake your hand.
What about your day at work?
I can't believe it.
How old are they?
Have they ever slept together?
I don't know.
I hope they use condoms.
I don't want to end up with a little brother.
I'd rather die.
Your mom's taking the pill?
I don't know.
We gotta put it in his morning coffee.
He's got hormones on him.
Sometimes I can see the future.
It shouldn't be fun knowing what's going to happen.
Are you still here?
Did I fall asleep?
Sometimes I don't sleep.
Then I think so.
I'm thinking about how it used to be.
That's all I have left.
What do you see when you look at me?
An old grinch who never answers questions?
Who mixes everything?
That we're taking care of him with food?
That's not me.
I... I'm wearing short panties.
I'm nine years old.
I'm running faster than the train.
I'm not even hurting my back anymore.
I'm 15.
I'm 15.
And I'm in love.
I'm in love.
He's not sleeping in the office?
I looked and he's not there.
- Have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.
There you are.
Did you sleep well?
- Who's that?
- It's me.
It's me, Dad.
Nemo.
Your son.
Of course, son.
Where have you been?
At the store, Dad.
- I still work there after school.
- A boy your age should get out more.
You can leave me alone.
I can handle it.
No problem, Dad.
I like being home.
There was a map of your mother.
- You didn't look at her.
- I know.
I'll read it later.
Aren't you going to see her one day?
I haven't seen her in seven years.
If she wanted to, she'd find me.
I have everything I need, Dad.
It's all right.
After 3 months and 6 days of travel,
the shuttle was heading straight to the Cancer Nebula,
in the axis of Uranus and its five moons.
We were approaching Mars and the colonies.
On board, the computer was monitoring the artificial hibernation of passengers.
Elise.
I'm not crazy!
I didn't say anything mean.
- Let's go, Nemo?
- Excuse me?
Shall we go?
Fuck you here.
You're gonna drown.
How do you know my name?
We're in the same high school.
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Are you a faggot?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I don't know.
I don't want it.
Tell me about yourself.
You were pissing in your pants, everybody thinks you're weird...
You're still alone...
Talk.
Say something... come on.
The weight on Mars is 0.38.
Three times less than on Earth.
The soil is covered with iron oxide dust.
You're amazing.
Raise your hand and say, "I swear."
Why?
Promise that if I die, you'll scatter my ashes on Mars.
It is estimated that the journey to Mars will take 6 to 8 months.
Say, "I swear."
I swear.
Children, we were neighbors.
Elise...
Don't you remember?
- I thought I'd met you before.
- It's the feeling of already-seen.
That would be the signal that the eyes transmit to the memory...
- That's not it.
In another life, then?
Anyway, I remember you.
Nemo, you shouldn't.
I'm not a good person.
Why do you say that?
- Elise, wait!
- I'll call you.
You don't have my number.
What happens when you fall in love?
In reaction to some stimuli, the hypothalamus releases a powerful endorphins discharge.
But why exactly this woman or this man?
Is there release of odourless pheromones related to a complementary genetic signal?
Or physical traits that we recognize?
Mother's eyes?
A smell awakening a happy memory?
Is love part of a plan?
A vast war plan between two modes of reproduction?
Bacteria and viruses are asexual organisms.
With each division and multiplication, they mutate and perfect themselves much faster than we do.
We answer this with a formidable weapon.
Sex.
Two beings, mixing their discomforts, scramble the cards and create a being that is all the more able to resist viruses because it is dissimilar to them.
Is one participating without knowing it in a war between two modes of reproduction?
Well, that'll be all for today.
You okay?
You want the truth?
I'm kidding.
It was good, really good.
My darling.
- I'll be late.
- Don't worry.
- I love you.
- I don't love you anymore.
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
Richer.
Okay, see you later.
I've always liked fish.
I never thought one day he'd love me too.
You're very relaxed.
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
Remember.
Remember.
Remember.
We're gonna go shopping for an hour.
Cover yourself against the sunburns.
I want you.
I want you, too.
Forever.
Forever.
Whatever happens, there's no life without you.
No life without you.
You look like my son.
I'm your son, Dad.
My son is taller than you.
Someone just walked in.
If I could at least move my fingers...
Or the eyes.
Do you think he can hear us?
Did you see him react?
I don't know.
But I feel that way.
Who's there?
What am I doing here?
- If you can hear me, move your fingers.
- I have to get out of here.
Go back... before the accident.
I believe in one thing...
That you always have to say "I love you" to the people you love.
I love you.
We should... we shouldn't.
I love Stefano.
What?
You saw him at the party with me.
He doesn't like me.
And?
I still love him.
It's stronger than me.
I'm in love with him.
I'm sorry.
Dad, I'm getting married.
- And who's the lucky one?
- That's not it.
I'm marrying the first girl to dance with me.
Thank you, Nemo.
That day... I'll make a lot of stupid decisions.
One:
I'll never leave anything to chance again.
Two: I'll marry the girl on my moped.
Three: I'll be rich.
Four, we'll have a house.
A big house.
Painted in yellow.
With a garden.
And two children:
Paul and Michael.
Five: I'll have a convertible.
A red convertible and a swimming pool.
I'll learn how to swim.
Six:
I won't stop until I get there.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Paul, don't wake your father.
It's me, Jeanne...
Who's Elise?
I don't know any Elise.
Go back to play, Paul.
Nemo, do I matter to you?
I just want to ask you a question.
Did you do it on purpose?
I found this on your nightstand.
"Arrive a moment in life where everything seems narrow.
"The choices have been made.
I can only continue.
"I know myself as the bottom of my pocket.
"I can predict all my reactions.
Everything is predictable.
"My life is cast into concrete, with airbags and seat belts.
"I've controlled everything. I've done everything to get to this point, and now that I'm there, I'm pissed off.
"The hardest part is knowing if I'm still alive."
It's my handwriting.
I don't remember.
What did you say?
I had a weird dream.
It must be understood that in life, not everything happens as expected.
Harry and I...
Life isn't always the way it's supposed to be.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.
Anna already knows.
Harry and I are gonna split up.
What?
Why?
- You don't have the right!
- You're not a stranger.
I don't know what's going on between you and I don't want to know.
It's unhealthy.
You're brother and sister!
We're not brother and sister!
You knew.
And you didn't tell me.
Where are you going?
In New York.
In 10 days.
My father found work there.
Wait by the lighthouse every Sunday, okay?
Until we saw each other again.
For life.
It's not over.
You're the first and last I'd like.
Ten days... 14 400 minutes.
I'd like everything to stop now and stay that way forever.
They say that slowing down your breathing slows down time.
The Hindus say that.
I have to remember the smell of every part of your body.
We'll meet by the lighthouse.
Anna, it's time to go.
I love you.
Anna, can you hear me?
We have to look at the future.
It'll be good to move.
To have a new life.
Will we have a pool?
You hate water.
You can't even swim.
You never know what you want.
I know what I don't want.
So tell me what you don't want.
I don't want to be like you.
You don't know anything about me.
I've always liked swimming pools.
Later, I'll have one.
Anna...
I feel like I'm gonna meet you every corner of the street.
Sometimes I think you might live in the same town as I do without me knowing.
Maybe you're here, close by.
Nemo, can you hear my voice?
Anna...
After 90 days, the onboard computer maintained passenger metabolism in a hibernation frog.
He had always been fascinated by these frogs who spend the winter completely frozen, and who in the coming spring - comma - freeze and recover to live
- point.
The on-board computer displayed:
end of hibernation.
Welcome to Mars.
We hope that your sleep and awakening have been pleasant.
Please leave your suit and cell... to join the arrivals room.
You will be oriented to prepare for your first trip to the Red Planet.
Probably the worst thing on Mars is that nothing's going on there.
Time will seem motionless and empty.
It doesn't look like there's much to do.
I hope I've taken enough sudokus.
The day.
It's daytime.
There's sun.
It's hotter on the right than on the left.
It's not... this morning's.
Not the same perfume.
His hands are soft.
Elise?
Is that Elise?
We shouldn't.
I love Stefano...
Don't say anything.
I love you.
You can count on me for Mars.
I promise you.
You want to go for a walk?
I don't want anything.
Nothing.
I'm such a sucker.
No, you're not.
I can't stand this life anymore.
- Think about it.
You have wonderful children.
- Stop cheering me up, it makes me feel even more guilty.
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What about Mom?
- Just a little tired.
She's sleeping.
- She's always tired.
Yeah, she's always tired.
- Is she depressed?
- Ups and downs.
I'm going to live somewhere else at Mom's next crisis.
Well, who knows a joke?
Anyone?
Me.
What's green, little, up and down?
A pea in an elevator.
Not funny, old man's humor.
Are you okay?
I'm fine even if Mom's not okay.
I can't stand it anymore.
That noise.
They're gonna turn the sound down.
But it's Joyce's birthday.
What mother am I?
I have to get up.
- Are you enjoying yourself?
You can't have a party without having fun!
And you know what else?
You look beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
But your friends don't dance.
And your mother will take care of the situation.
All of you... we dance.
We're dancing.
You over there, quick!
And the rest of you, slow down!
Guess what's happening to me?
I'm a dog.
Everybody's gonna scream, okay?
One, two, three...
It was a nice day.
The most beautiful in a long time.
- Ready?
- Goodbye, Dad.
Goodbye.
Have fun.
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving you!
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Do you love me?
I couldn't live without you.
There's no life without you.
Take it easy.
I have to get used to it.
I talked to you so much when you were away...
It's so strange to really talk to you.
I need time, Nemo.
When we were separated when we were 15, I said I wouldn't like anyone, ever.
That I would never cling.
That I wouldn't settle anywhere.
That I wouldn't have anything of mine.
I decided I'd pretend to live.
And here's what I've been waiting for all this time.
Give up all possible lives for one... with you.
But I'm not used to it anymore, you know.
To love... I mean...
I'm afraid I'll lose you again.
To have to do without you again.
It terrifies me.
We need time.
But I want to see you again.
Call me at this number.
In two days.
I'll meet you at the lighthouse.
You want to know why I lost Anna?
Because two months earlier, a Brazilian unemployed man had an egg baked.
The heat created a microclimate in the room.
A slight change in temperature... and heavy rains two months later at the other end of the world.
This Brazilian got himself cooked an egg instead of being at work.
He was fired from his textile factory because six months ago, I compared the price of jeans and bought the cheapest.
As the Chinese proverb says:
"A simple snowflake can fold the bamboo leaf."
The manufacture of jeans has been relocated.
I lost all of Anna's evidence.
I waited for her.
Every day.
It's coming back.
Anxiety comes back.
I'm sick of medicine.
Goddamn doctors.
It's no use.
Do something, I can't take it anymore.
I'm scared!
I don't know what to do.
I often have that dream.
During prehistory...
I can hear you screaming.
I'm hunting the bear.
And you're not scared anymore.
But when I wake up...
When I wake up, there are no bears, but you're always scared.
I'm not a bear hunter.
I'm in a photocopier factory and I just quit.
I don't dare move.
I don't live.
Whatever I do, it's a disaster.
I'd love to hunt the bear, so you won't be afraid anymore.
To what extent are our fears innate?
If goose eggs hatch as an incubator and above the goose you pass a silhouette imitating a goose in flight...
The little ones stretch their necks and call.
But if we reverse the silhouette, it evokes a hawk.
The reaction of the gooses is immediate.
They get grounded when they've never seen a hawk.
Without any learning, innate fear helps them survive.
But in humans, what ancestral dangers do our innate fears correspond to?
NEMO, RETURN YOU
Excuse me!
Remember.
Remember.
My darling, it's me.
But is Elise dead or not?
I don't understand.
Either you had children or not.
Hey, Dad.
Hello.
I'll be there in a minute.
- Aren't you hungry?
- I don't want anything.
You're welcome.
- What are you doing today?
- I thought I'd use it to wash the car.
What's wrong with this car?
What do you mean?
Why are you so busy leaving me here alone?
What's wrong with the car?
There's no problem with the car anymore.
What's the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Am I taking sugar from my coffee?
Can you answer me?
You don't know me, Nemo.
You never really looked at me.
You've always been somewhere else.
Do you realize how much you're hurting me?
He says you put everything you own in my name.
Why, Nemo?
What are you doing?
BUY THE FISHING CAN "PAPILLON"
Jeanne!
I'm going out to buy a fishing rod.
Mr. Jones?
We have your luggage.
Follow me, please.
I'll take you to the hotel to rest.
The meeting's at 3:00.
Daniel...
Daniel Jones.
Daniel Jones.
Your name is...
Daniel Jones?
Of course not.
- Daniel?
- Yes.
Are you crazy?
I told you not to go!
They're furious.
They know it's you.
Don't stay here!
That's weird.
He doesn't have the same size.
Maybe he narrowed it down.
It happens when you get older.
That's bullshit.
You just got the wrong guy, that's all.
Astronauts lose 5 cm when they get home.
Because of gravity.
You think he's an astronaut?
The soil does not vibrate in the same way.
It's a different fragrance.
How old can she be?
25 years?
There are other people, too.
Let's go back.

The two moons Phobos and Deimos are clearly visible up there.
To your left, the Valles Marineris and the top of the Tharsis dome.
- What's the matter?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.
He doesn't care about me.
I love him.
I don't see any other explanation to be in this state.
It can only be that.
I love him.
I know I'm crazy.
In the morning, I open my eyes and I see your face and it makes me cry.
I realize I'm with you and my life is running away.
How can you stay so calm?
How do you stand that?
You're not human.
I don't know what to do.
It's not my fault, is it?
You're not leaving me, are you?
No, I couldn't live without you.
I'm hurting everyone.
You.
Kids.
- It can't last.
- Together, we'll make it.
If I stay, you'll drown with me.
We'll learn how to swim.
I love you.
I love you.
She left me.
And you know what they say...
"Everything ends up getting better.
"Even bad."
Not too short on top.
- Do I owe you?
- 20 bucks, please.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
$20, S.V.P.
- That's it.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye.
Good afternoon.
Why doesn't smoke ever get back in the cigarette?
Why are molecules moving away?
Why doesn't the ink drop reform?
Because the universe is evolving towards a stage of dissipation.
This is the principle of entropy.
The tendency of the universe to evolve towards a growing stage of disorder.
The principle of entropy is linked to the "arrow of time", the result of the expansion of the universe.
But what happens when the gravitation compensates for the expansion?
Or if the quantum void was too weak?
At this point, the universe will begin its phase of contraction: the Big Crunch.
What will happen to time?
Will he reverse himself?
No one knows the answer.
Where's Peter?
He left an hour ago. I'll replace him.
I've got catch three and four.
I prefer Peter to choose.
It's not that you're incompetent...
In life, we're only allowed to take a shot.
If it's bad, we'll do with it.
You know him?
We're working together.
If I were to die and if you were to live, and the time was to gargle again, and the morning was to shine and burn as usual...
My sincere condolences.
Peter was a colleague.
Of course.
I saw your show.
Thanks for coming.
Don't forget to take a last look at the planet from our observation dome.
Your elevator will soon reach the transit station of Mars.
What do we do with all these bikes?
It's for export.
The labour force is cheaper here.
China has become unpayable.
Win the preparation area where you expect your sleep combination.
You will also receive your injections.
Hello.
- My name is Nemo.
- Anna.
Nice to meet you.
What brings you to Mars?
I measure the distance between Mars and Earth to its maximum.
I'm studying time.
You know, that thing that doesn't make everything happen at the same time.
- And?
- The Big Crunch is for 2092.
And those who hold on until then will win a free ride.
What about you?
I keep an old promise.
Hello.
We met at your husband's funeral.
I felt like I knew you.
It's the feeling of already-seen.
No, it's not that.
It's like it's not all true.
I'm sorry, you must think I'm crazy.
I'm not trying to seduce you.
I'm a widower myself.
Excuse me, I have to go.
Maybe another time.
I heard you were dead.
- That you drowned.
- Drown?
Alert.
Meteorites approaching.
Don't panic.
I want to wake up.
I want to wake up.
I want to wake up.
You okay?
Are you okay?
At "3", you'll wake up.
One.
Two.
Three.
REVEIL YOU
- Mom.
- Do I know you?
- It's me.
- What do you want?
- Henry!
- It's me, your son Nemo.
My son's here.
I don't know you.
You're crazy.
Go or I'll call the police.
Mom.
Mom.
- What do you see?
- He's asking me what I see.
I say, "A stain of ink."
- He says...
- You have to say more.
I say, "A stain of ink on a sheet of paper."
You have to say what's going on with your head.
It reminds me of an inkwriter.
So he says, "It's okay."
You have until noon tomorrow to vote.
Vote and win your holiday on the Moon with your family!
Win a trip on the Moon and perfect yourself on fabulous golf courses!
They announced the result of the vote.
I'm sorry.
At my age, candles cost more than cake.
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm afraid I haven't lived enough!
You should write on the blackboard of all schools:
"Life is a playground... otherwise it's nothing."
NEMO, DO YOU NOW?
NEMO, LIS THE NEWPORT NEWS
TRAGIC ACCIDENT OF ROAD
NEMO, VA SEE PAGE 5
LOOKING AT THE ROAD OF THE RUE
NEMO, CALL ON 123,581 1321
Hello, who is it?
- Hello?
Who is it?
- Who is it?
I was told to call that number.
My name is Nemo Nobody.
- Is that a joke?
- No.
No... I...
Information?
I would like the address of 123-581-1321.
One minute, please.
12358 Alois Street.
Hello, Nemo.
Glad you found me.
It must all seem very complicated to you, but it's easier than you think.
Be careful, the chair is broken.
You okay?
All right.
What?
I should've told you sooner, but I couldn't, because of the text.
Text?
The text of our conversation.
Can you hear me?
What you're living right now is the past... at least for me.
I'm you...
with seventy more years.
Everything you say, I said when I was young.
All I had to do was transcribe our conversation.
It's all written here.
- I can't...
Believe it.
For me, time is reversed.
I'm leaving from the end of the story and going back to the beginning.
I don't understand.
In this life, you don't exist.
I don't know why.
Only the architect knows.
The architect?
The child.
The one running behind the train.
Maybe your parents didn't meet.
Maybe your father killed himself in a sledge at five.
Maybe you're one of the vast majority whose genetic code hasn't reached its destination.
Maybe when you died, a prehistoric woman wiped out the offspring of which you are a part.
And so, in this world... you don't exist.
If Anna's calculations are correct, you have to stay alive until 2092, on February 12, at 5:50.
05:41 12 February 2092
I don't know how long it doesn't record.
I have to return my paper in the morning.
Everything you say contradicts each other.
You can't have been in 2 places at the same time.
You mean we have to choose.
Of all these lives... which one is the right one?
Each of these lives is the right one.
Every path is the right path.
"Everything could have been anything else and made just as much sense."
Tennessee Williams.
You're too young to know.
You can't be dead and still here.
You can't not exist.
Is there a life after death?
After death?
How can you be so sure that you exist?
You don't exist.
And neither do I.
We live only in the imagination of a 9-year-old.
We are imagined by a 9-year-old child faced with an impossible choice.
Run!
Run!
I love you.
I love you.
Chess... it's called Zugzwang.
When the only viable blow...
Is not to move.
Come and see.
- The child is taking her apart.
He doesn't need it anymore.
Before that, he was unable to choose, because he didn't know what was going to happen.
Now that he knows what's going to happen, he's unable to choose.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

This is the most beautiful day of my life.
