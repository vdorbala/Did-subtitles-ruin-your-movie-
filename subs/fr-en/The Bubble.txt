No camera.
It's a military zone.
Do you have a written order?
- My word is enough.
- No, that's right.
I said, no camera!
You're overstepping your rights!
I'm not gonna say it again!
Commander!
A bus is coming.
Get those fuckers out of here.
Move a little, you're starting to inflate me.
Everybody down!
Faster than that!
In line on two rows.
Lift your shirts one by one and slowly.
- It's not allowed to film.
- Yeah?
And why?
You heard the officer.
He has no right of censorship.
After all, I don't care.
Next.
It's okay.
Not so fast, so I can see.
You and your fat belly, what are you hiding?
What's he asking for?
He wants to see your belly.
Do as he tells you.
Take it easy, Jihad.
Now, I.D., get your IDs out of here.
Help!
She's lost the water, please help us!
Call an ambulance!
I'm a paramedic.
Don't be afraid, it's like a doctor.
Send an ambulance.
She's choking!
You'll breathe better.
- What about the ambulance?
Don't be afraid.
The ambulance's on its way.
- Don't worry about her!
- Yes.
Talk to him.
How are you feeling?
I'm really hurting.
He doesn't know anything about it!
You're scaring him.
What's the ambulance doing?
The doctor's coming.
- What's going on?
- She's going to give birth.
I'm a doctor.
I'll take care of you.
It's a seat.
Push, push!
Again!
Stronger, stronger.
We're almost there.
One more time.
That's it!
He's not breathing.
Where's my son?
- She wants her baby.
- You got a pulse?
- No, I'm resuscitating.
I'm so sorry.
He doesn't have a pulse.
There's nothing we can do.
You killed the baby!
- Stop it, Jihad.
- Let me do it.
Silence, disperse.
The incident is closed.
Get back in line.
Identity check.
"The third ear"
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
You got the last Britney?
It's called "My Prerogative."
- It's on DVD.
- "Prerogative"?
The clip where she's blond.
Don't know him.
Why don't you take the new Stones box?
It'll open your ears.
What a douche!
Come on, let's get out of here.
It was a mess over there, wasn't it?
Your turn!
I already have the style of the house.
Uncontracted.
I'm the one you need.
I come here a lot.
You have to queue for half an hour to get a table, but your sweet potato donuts are worth it.
The girls at the bar and the guys in the room, it's a little out of date, isn't it?
Look at me!
You can't let a girl like me pass.
I had a bar in Netanya.
I start as a waiter, and in two months, I'm the boss.
- The boss is me.
- We're partnering!
I'm opening you a restaurant in Azrieli, there's nothing in this mall.
We're not a chain.
This place is unique.
You have to see big!
That's why Golan is here.
This Golan is not bad.
You're kidding me.
You're kidding, I hope.
He has no style.
Well, maybe we should change it.
All our servers are clones.
Let's think about it.
Yali, you can do it if you want, but spare us your theories, okay?
- What?
- Our soldier's back.
- Is he home?
- I'll be five minutes.
- Take your time.
What's up here?
- What about that handsome kid you see?
Nothing at all.
I didn't even see him.
Why do you want anything new?
- The world is changing.
All the guys want is to go to bed and get out.
Short term, especially no commitment.
To hold a guy, you have to take his time.
When his male instincts tell him
"Shut up, she's hanging on!", maybe he'll remember the good times together and decide to stay for good.
- How long have you been heating it?
- Three weeks.
Maybe you should move to a higher speed.
If you care about this Sharon,
Miss Carrie Bradshaw, it's time for action.
You think?
Tell me, on the side of guys in the army, how was it?
RAS.
Anyone?
Not even a cute terrorist?
Please.
I don't want to be told about the army anymore.
Sharon...
Are you busy?
An editorial meeting?
Nothing special.
- Tonight, why don't you come by?
Yeah, at my place.
Is that okay with you?
We could rent a DVD.
No, I don't want to go out.
Why?
My roommates?
We're going to Sinai.
They're going to Sinai.
"Shirli Lilo, our candidate from Rehovot"
Are you looking at this shit?
Don't you think you're doing a little too much?
My mom prepared this for you, so you better love it.
You look great!
It's time to go!
- Wait a minute.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Noam is dying to see the editor.
I said no!
You dropped your ID.
I didn't realize that.
Come in!
They're my roommates.
Yali, Lulu, and...
Ashraf.
Ashraf and I met at a dam.
Hello.
Am I falling bad?
We're the roommates.
My name is Yali, this is Noam.
And Ashraf.
Ashraf?
Nice to meet you.
Don't be late.
You're gonna miss your bus.
Yali, I have to withdraw money first.
I'll meet you at the bus station.
Just a moment, I forgot my palm trees.
Tel Aviv, Ashraf.
Ashraf, Tel Aviv.
The sea is there, but we don't see it.
The idiots of Europeans who built this city didn't understand anything about the Mediterranean.
The city turns its back on the sea.
The streets are parallel to the coast.
In addition, the hotels close the view and block the wind from the sea.
There's no breath of air.
Are you sweating?
I'm sweating.
I'm swimming.
I must have in my bag the towels Yali steals from the gym.
So that's how the Jews kiss?
You don't like it?
Yes, a lot.
I thought we could...
How do you say, go further?
That's right, go further.
Golan?
Nice shirt.
Isn't that right?
- All tafioles!
- You got a problem?
We can be gay without being effeminated.
Everyone is free.
If they like to be effeminate!
You're kidding me!
Who wants to bite the pillow?
- Bite the pillow...
- You don't know the expression?
So you'd rather soak the stick?
I was joking.
Don't take it badly.
How naive you are!
- What's that?
- I made them.
Nice!
They're just T-shirts for my friends.
I'd like to be a designer.
Go to New York next year.
- It's the best school.
- That's what they say.
Or maybe in Paris.
Albert Elbaz started in New York, and today he's a designer at Lanvin's.
But he really has talent.
And I don't?
Of course I do.
I'm sure you can break through.
There's talent in Tel Aviv.
But you have to move, make a name abroad.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
You look nervous.
What are you afraid of?
- About you, maybe.
Are you afraid of me?
No, it's nothing.
Really nothing?
No.
So the Arabs do that?
You didn't like that?
Yes, a lot.
I thought we could go further.
It was horrible.
We...
You think...
Not us.
That woman at the dam.
It happens all the time.
Jihad, the guy who was with me there, is engaged to my sister.
Her father had a heart attack.
The ambulance was held at the dam.
The search lasted more than an hour.
He died when he arrived at the hospital.
If he hadn't been arrested...
But you know why there are dams.
Forget your propaganda.
Let's not talk about politics.
- Did you think I was talking about us?
- I don't know.
We both had fun!
Scattered?
You don't know that word?
Yes, "bring a bomb out," for example.
We also say it when something is great.
We can have fun in bed.
Fun!
- Sharon's not here?
- He went to his spinning.
Spinning in the morning!
What a snob!
It's delicious.
People have forgotten what a simple tomato could have of sublime!
I'm out of battery.
Can I call on yours?
Of course.
Thank you.
Is he gonna stay here?
He doesn't have a pass.
If we arrest him, it's prison.
Are we gonna put him in a closet?
Stop.
Being gay over there is hell.
I want to leave Nablus.
I'm not marrying Jihad's cousin.
Stop putting pressure on me.
Calm down.
Where are you?
In Jerusalem, at a friend's house.
They'd kill me if they knew.
No one's gonna kill you.
Did you go crazy?
Who is it?
Do I know her?
A divorced Christian.
- Does she have children?
- No, no kids.
How are you?
- I miss you.
- You too.
I'll see you soon.
I'm coming back from Jordan at the end of the exams.
Jihad don't worry?
He's so extremist.
He's gonna get us into trouble.
Look, I love Jihad.
He's an intelligent man.
He promised to stop me soon.
After we get married, we'll go to Jordan, away from all this.
What are you doing?
I'll refresh your memory.
"The roommates undertake to respect the following rules:"
"An affair of more than 8 days..."
What no one wants...
"...requires the agreement of the tenants
"and may not exceed 2 weeks.
"There will be no exceptions."
If for once, we were acting instead of discussing human rights?
This is an opportunity to help someone.
By offering him political asylum?
Stop!
It's concrete this time.
I don't want to be accused of sabotaging the left.
I'm bowing!
Well done.
What's the reward of a gay martyr in Paradise?
70 virgins or 70 Mr. Muscle?
You think he can choose?
Golan, I'm so sorry.
Orna owes a favor to a guy.
Yeah, I know, but I can't help it.
I'm so sorry.
I swear to God, as soon as a place is free, it's for you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
See you again?
We remember.
Do you have Shirli Lilo's video?
Of course.
And all the finalists.
Over there on the right.
24 hours in Tel Aviv, it's sharky!
You didn't waste any time.
Lovers?
- Can you tell?
- Nothing like kicking!
- Can I help you?
- Thank you, not for now.
Hello, what are you doing?
Still in the editorial conference?
I'll call you later.
The color is really Arabic!
The smell, too.
What does this soap smell like?
You don't like it?
Not really, no.
Our fragrances are unique.
Alas, the clientele does not always taste good.
How dare you!
If I judge by the perfume you're wearing.
What an insolence!
Who do you think you are?
Excuse her, she's not...
Let's get out of here.
- I need some air.
- That's right, calm down.
Hey, beautiful!
Hello.
Tcheky doesn't even get a little smile?
I have to stop.
This job sucks.
It's temporary, anyway.
Yes, I hope... excuse me.
- That son of a bitch is filtering my calls.
- What?
Nothing, forget it.
We made great stickers.
- May I?
- No, you're crazy!
Not here, she'll think it's me.
RAVING THE CONCUPATION
Pull back the sleeves, and it'll be perfect.
You think?
What do you say about color?
I hired him as a waiter.
I didn't tell Orna and Ella.
We'd need a belt.
And especially another name with a custom CV.
Awesome, the belt!
Don't move.
I, too, was fantasizing about George Michael.
This whole wall made me fantasize.
You loved George Michael?
Who was cracking you when you were 15?
River Phoenix, Morrissey,
Chris Lowe and the Pet Shop Boys... lots of others.
Be careful, he's gonna do us the inventory of his store!
You usually ask for more!
And as soon as you get out, he'll give the Take That back.
Jason Orange!
Hey Jason, who else used to make me like that from high school?
Jason, my beloved dancer, I was crazy about you.
When he left the band, I almost went to London to see him.
Who was your favorite Take That?
Robbie, of course.
What about you?
Always so snob!
Why don't we replace the Boyzones with a picture of Michel Foucault?
Shut up!
What?
A little culture, a little humanism, for Christ's sake!
We're all brothers after all.
I could never put this on!
My clothes fit him a lot better.
But the choice is limited.
Ashraf, come on.
My dear, I see you don't feel good, but I have what you need.
I brought my new script.
- Read it!
- I'd love to.
I know you wrote it for me.
This role is for me.
Boy!
Wait a minute!
Observe and do exactly as I do.
Good evening.
No, no...
That's all we can't do.
Stay natural.
What's your name?
That's right.
He needs a Hebrew name.
I worked on a construction site where we all had a Hebrew name.
They called me Shimi.
Shimon's diminutive?
Or Samson.
"Let me die with the Philistines."
The first suicide bombing in history!
Come on, why not?
My name is Shimi.
Kebab, salad, tehina?
How come you don't have an accent?
"If you want, I'll tell you right away.
"What's your name?
"In us, he has no di trabail. We, we want peace."
I didn't mean that.
Kid, I lived in Jerusalem.
I was helping my uncle who had a souvenir shop.
We had a lot of Jewish clients, I learned with them.
My uncle said:
"This kid talks like a Jew, it's not good."
I recommend our sweet potato doughnuts.
These are the T-shirts as promised.
All right, everybody, sit down.
We have a busy schedule.
Be careful!
I promised to make the room impeccable.
Don't worry, immigrants arrive at 5:00 a.m. to clean up.
Don't start!
We've got a lot to figure out.
Ladies and gentlemen: the program!
Departure from Tel-Aviv, in convoy of 4x4. Arrival at the parking lot of the beach of Tel-Baruch.
Climbing from the dunes to the rave site.
Question.
What about the cops?
They're only interested in raves in the desert.
The last time, they landed anyway.
- If they show up, we'll counterattack.
- We're counter-attacking!
Let's move on to my poster project.
RAVING THE CONCUPATION
This time, I decided everyone would be naked.
For the vine leaves, I took over the colours of Palestine and Israel.
With other colors, we'd have more people.
Why don't we take the ones from Denmark and Sweden?
That would be pretty and neutral.
You don't have to be cynical.
I just think we should drop politics and get a message like, "We're young and against war."
Where?
In New Zealand?
Why don't we invite Palestinians?
We've tried it before, but it's not obvious.
Anybody know a nice Palestinian?
I know some.
So what?
Is the army going to give them permission to come?
Land!
Why don't you go to the dams?
Go to the separation wall, did you set foot in the West Bank?
What about you?
I came back from a month on a dam in Nablus, okay?
You didn't say no?
We're here for the poster.
You'll discuss politics later.
Hey, Lulu.
You want one?
There's plenty left.
Your T-shirts are very successful.
You're good.
Where are you going now?
Take a drink with the boys.
So, one of these days.
Nice place, isn't it?
Golan's coming.
Not a word about Shimi's job at the coffee shop.
What is it?
- A new show, "The Tordus."
Yeah, a great room.
A love story between two men in Auschwitz.
It's with Lior Ashkenazi.
We have to go check this out!
Do you like theater?
Enough, but I've never seen anything in Hebrew.
What's up?
My roommates, Lulu and Noam.
I told you about them.
And this is Shimi, Noam's friend.
Palestinian, huh?
Your shorts are a little Palestinian.
Golan finished his service two years ago, but he still has a troupe mentality.
Who served with the Golani, is Golani for life.
Commando Golani knows which side you're on?
Honey, I don't have secrets for them.
I didn't hide anything from them and they took it very well.
They're my brothers.
We broke our ass together tracking down the terrorists in Hebron's casba.
In those alleyways where these dogs can shoot you at any moment, it doesn't matter whether the one covering you is gay or straight.
I'm gonna get a drink, are you coming?
No, not now.
We don't like Arabs either.
Did I say something stupid?
Your friends don't like the army?
What about you?
- I'm out of here.
- What's going on?
What are you doing?
I'm reading the news from home.
- What's going on?
- As usual.
Come on, fuck me.
"Shove me up?"
You got a problem with that?
- Let's just say...
- You'd rather fuck me?
Have sex where you'd sodomize me?
You're drunk!
Yes, of desire, my love.
Not in the hallway, please.
Who is it?
My mother.
Where does she live?
Nowhere, she's dead.
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.
We lived in Jerusalem.
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
Fuck your fucking ass.
Yes, Mom!
Again!
Fuck me.
Ouch, Mom, again!
Mom, fuck me.
Mom...
- Fuck me!
- Fuck your fucking ass.
Perverse!
Mom!
Mom!
Stop or I'll call his commando!
Good idea, I'm already wet!
Please.
You're all invited to a hell of a party.
A rave against the occupation.
Come on October 23rd and enjoy peace!
We don't want Territories, we want to dance!
Rave against the occupation! Rave for peace!
You all want peace, don't you?
We all want the same thing.
Come dance for peace!
You're all the same.
You don't understand!
- Young people want peace!
- With terrorists!
Have you ever seen a kid's brain explode in an attack?
Don't let them push me.
They're crazy!
I would have slapped them!
Stupid people.
- You okay?
- It's okay.
It's itching.
- What's that?
- I've got a lot of ass.
TIME OUT TEL-AVIV
Follow me!
Lulu!
What's she doing?
- Where's Sharon?
- Right at the bottom of the hall.
- He's waiting for you?
- I'm looking forward to it!
How are you?
Fuck you.
What's the matter with you?
A poor asshole.
That's what you are!
Calm down!
You think you're Joey Starr and me, a whore?
You've been avoiding me for a month.
Is it to send you to the air that you're filtering my calls?
Is that your way of doing it?
There's a porn site for you.
It's the lousy dick club.
They can't wait to recruit you.
All right, let's get out of here.
No one lives in reality.
People live in a bubble.
The kibbutz is also a bubble.
The colonies, too.
Who can say where the real world begins and stops?
Maybe...
- Are you new?
- Yes.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- What's your name?
A beautiful name for a handsome boy.
- Is everything okay?
- See that tip?
She's doing it to all the new people.
When she finds out you're gay, she'll be less generous.
You've got visitors!
Hello.
Are you new here?
I just got hit.
At least she left me 40 shekels.
Nice tip.
But I'm offering you better than that.
Tonight, after the pictures for the poster, I'll take you to the theater.
Say, do you...
What?
Do you miss it?
What?
You know.
- Yeah, I miss it.
What?
We're missing.
We're here together, we could do it.
We don't even have the right to look at each other or touch each other.
- You can feel...
- Feel what?
Feel the other.
Without looking at each other.
I can feel you all right here next to me.
Do you feel me?
Maybe.
Don't worry.
He can't hear us.
Do you feel me?
- No, I'm touching you.
- It's okay.
- I caress you.
- It's sweet.
- It's intoxicating.
- I kiss your eyes.
- Yes.
- Your tongue.
- Your neck.
- Yes.
- Down.
- Yes.
- Again.
- Do you feel my lips?
You know what I'm doing?
- Do you smell like it?
- Yes.
- Together.
- Together.
- Do you feel me?
- Penetrate me.
- Do you feel me?
- Deep.
- I'm gonna...
- Strong.
- You feel like I'm gonna...
- Strong.
- Strong.
- Yes.
Did you...?
Yes.
- What about you?
- You're a good one.
- You too.
- Max?
- What?
We did.
You know what?
Fucking guard, fucking camp, we did it!
It was so real.
We had sex.
They can't kill us.
I like that thing about putting a finger on the eyebrow to say, "I love you."
A chance we don't need it.
Tel Aviv, maybe.
- Where did you live in Jerusalem?
- On the French Hill.
Really?
I lived in Issawiya.
Really?
You never told me.
I was young when we left.
I have very few memories.
- So we were neighbors.
- Yeah, if we want to.
My father's whole family is from Jerusalem.
- So you're Israeli?
- Not anymore.
We lived at my grandparents' house.
When my sister was born, my father decided to build.
All his savings went into this house.
He built it with his own hands.
She was beautiful.
My sister and I were playing on the construction site.
Then the demolition order came.
- What happened?
- What happened?
A bulldozer came to shave the house.
There was nothing to do.
In an hour, the house was gone.
- What did you do?
- I was just a kid.
I tried to throw stones, but my father stopped me.
He said we'd live somewhere else in our house.
We returned our Israeli papers and went to Nablus.
My mother tried to dissuade him.
She thought it was better to have Israeli papers.
But my father was sick, he didn't want to hear anything.
You scared me.
What are you doing in the dark?
There was nothing to do with it.
How was the play?
Interesting. A good topic for reflection.
You should go.
Yes, as I announced aloud at the Club, I do intend to do.
- It's okay.
Yali, I'm sorry, I forgot.
As always.
Just think about yourself, that's what you do best.
What do you mean?
- That's clear, isn't it?
- You want to talk about it?
Nothing to say.
I just don't think that's normal.
- That I'm happy?
- No, but for once he's neither a straight nor a tourist, he could at least...
Spit it out.
How can I say that?
We're trying to forget politics a little bit.
We don't even campaign with the pacifists.
We're just trying to live.
Do you understand?
I don't want to ruin your pleasure, but...
It's true he's nice, and it's going well at the coffee shop.
But deep down, it sounds wrong.
What are you suggesting?
Nothing, Noam.
Just... a good topic for reflection.
I'll convince him for the nude.
Do you trust me?
Let me handle it.
There he is, I'll leave you.
What's up?
- A double espresso, thank you.
- And I'm a Corona.
Perfect.
Well?
You know we're preparing the Spring Special.
We offer two pages to celebrities to talk about the places that connect them.
- You'll be on the cover.
- Who are the others?
Artists, creators, people we're talking about.
You, with your play "The Tordus."
Camelia and her avant-garde project.
Mali Levi and his ad for the Jeans.
- What are you thinking about the brood?
- A big production.
You in the middle, naked, surrounded by 15 naked girls.
- Did you see my play?
- Of course.
Excellent.
The play is one thing and the Spring Special, another.
Auschwitz isn't sexy, and the cover must be.
Yeah, I guess Auschwitz isn't sexy enough.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- How have you been since the other day?
- Don't you remember me?
- Tell me.
We met at Lulu's.
We met again in the paper.
You can't have forgotten that!
You must be confused.
Am I scaring you?
I just wanted to make a piece of paper about your story.
"Tel Aviv seen by a Palestinian."
Excuse me for a moment.
Yali, sorry, an emergency.
I hope I didn't scare him.
About what?
I want to do an article about him.
On him?
Do you have any other Palestinians here?
We could do a show.
- They're in order, aren't they?
- What are you talking about?
He's gone.
All right...
I don't think this is the time.
Why didn't you tell us?
Open the breath window
My only love Let the wind play With the outside and the inside...
It smells like fawn here.
Aere a little.
You're gonna attract flies.
Neighbors think we're hiding a corpse.
You know we have a shower.
Go for a ride or stop at the escarres.
Keep fasting. A double Kippur can't hurt.
For total purging, we have castor oil if you want.
It's your mother.
Yes, Mom.
No, the TV's off.
No, Ashraf's not here.
He's in Nablus!
Today in Nablus, an Apache helicopter fired a missile at Riyad Bek's car, the head of Hamas' armed wing.
IDF states that Bek was creating a local al-Qaeda cell.
He's not answering.
I've sent out a lot of messages.
I'm worried.
What do we do?
Tell me...
Do you think at a dam, I could look like a reporter?
Some kind of... Christiane Amanpour?
You're going crazy too?
I have an idea.
A brilliant idea.
RAVING THE CONCUPATION
Shaul!
I couldn't wait to stick them up so you could see them.
- That's not bad.
- Not bad?
Great, you mean.
You're the best.
Thank you.
Look, I really have to go.
Is something going on?
Lots of things.
I'll tell you.
- Promised?
- Promised.
Sharon?
The fucker's headed for your office.
Yeah, she's here.
I'll take care of it.
What do you want?
To force me to call the police?
I'm signing a cease-fire, but you're gonna help me.
- How can I help you?
- I need a press card.
- A press card?
- Yes, temporary.
Like last time.
Here are some pictures to send to the dams.
- We're going to Nablus.
- Nablus?
Yeah, we're doing an investigation.
An investigation into what?
The behaviour of the next day among young Palestinians.
Don't do it again!
Yali arranged the car well.
He'll end up artistic director.
- We have to put this in front of you.
- He thought of everything.
But he didn't want to come.
You know we can't rip it off from Tel Aviv.
We'd better stop Hebrew and practice English.
No, they'll guess right away.
With a French accent, we'll be undetectable.
I can't talk like that.
We're coming to the dam.
I don't want anyone to recognize me.
Come on, come on, next!
Put the suitcase down.
Open it.
Unpack.
Give it to me.
I'm sorry.
What's that?
Henna for the wedding.
Show me that.
Are you sure it's henna?
Yes.
Check it out.
- That's it.
- You can pack it up.
Close the door.
What are you doing here?
You want them to kill me?
I was so worried.
I couldn't call you back.
You don't know how it is here.
I'm so sorry.
You're crazy.
Jihad!
Wait!
Don't tell anyone.
I never imagined you were.
Promise me you won't say anything!
I'm not gonna ruin your sister's wedding.
Did you invite them?
- No.
- Let them go!
- Let them go!
- Promise first.
Until the marriage, Allah knows it only.
My cousin Samira will be at the wedding.
You have to get married.
Marry her quickly, and I won't say anything.
- I can't!
- Take it or leave it.
I missed you.
Is everything okay?
Are you sure?
That sucks.
Give it to me.
Can't you see he's demolished?
You have to come to the rave.
Do you know where this is?
She misses you terribly.
That's right, I miss you.
You didn't invite Golan?
- That's not his type.
- Why not?
I'm gonna find someone.
There's only the embarrassment of choice.
Thank you for making me feel better!
- What about you, Noam-la-depresse?
- What, me?
You want some ecstasy?
What for?
Feel better, you idiot!
- Well done, you won!
Our friend Ashraf just made a remarkable entrance.
You're jealous!
Don't we have the right to joke anymore?
- I'm so happy!
- I never thought I'd make it.
For hours at the dams, crossing the border by taxi taking the mountain... well, I'll spare you the details.
It's great that you're here.
What are you doing here?
Why, is it private?
Are you filtering?
No, you did well to come, but...
Is it because of the protest?
I'm showing up too.
I'm all that's left.
See you...
I kept some in case you came.
I'm glad you're here.
Open your mouth.
Say Aaah!
You're such a badger!
It's Golan's basic trick.
I dance with someone else, it makes you jealous and you apply it again.
What do you want?
What can you be heavy about?
Come dance, man!
How's it going?
What?
Yeah, I think so.
- Go on...
- She's not interested in me.
- You know I love you?
- Really?
Really.
And I want to get laid.
Let's get married and make a lot of kids.
You're totally freaked out, aren't you?
No, I mean it.
It's not because I drank.
That's how I feel.
All right.
I'll see if I'm participating or I'll let you do this on my own.
Remember the square between the French Hill and Issawiya?
Yes, a playground for Jews.
Yes, when I was five or six, all the kids were there.
Maybe we played together.
Probably not, otherwise, I'd have noticed you.
I'm kidding.
My father was chair of the neighbourhood committee.
People complained.
He banned Issawiya's people from coming to play squares.
My mother violently blamed him.
She invited the women and their children to a reconciliation party at the square.
My father laughed at me saying that it jeopardized regional peace and that no one would come.
Besides, on the day of the feast, no one came.
Not even his Israeli friends.
It was later learned that they had been under pressure.
My mother and I tasted it all by themselves, sitting on a bench.
She pushed me on the swing for hours.
When we got home, my dad was watching football on TV.
In the evening, when she bathed me, I saw that she was crying.
She wiped her tears stealthily and I made the one who didn't see anything.
It may sound silly, but I think it was that day that her illness started.
In fact, I'm sure of it.
I love Tel-Aviv on Saturday mornings.
Tel-Aviv can be very beautiful.
Like now where everything is peaceful and quiet.
I love Tel-Aviv.
Too bad it's all around, it's just as messy.
If only we could remove the policy.
- You didn't invite Shaul?
- What for?
Last night, it looked so romantic.
And where's Golan?
Don't change the subject, we were in Shaul.
- He was drunk.
- You're drunk!
- So charming and sexy!
- No, just drunk.
"I swear it's not because I'm drunk.
"You're beautiful and I really want to jump you.
"By the back if you want."
- You're playing well?
I even wanted to be a singer.
Really?
In high school, we had our own band, The Mermaids.
We used all the classics.
Do you know Tim Buckley?
No.
During my shift, I stopped, and never really picked up since.
Now it's too late.
No, we're young.
We've got our whole life ahead of us.
- At my age?
- "At my age?"
You're kidding!
Sing something.
I want to hear you sing.
- Come on!
- Are you sure?
Yes.
It's a song my mother loved very much, and she often asked me to play it.
We don't have to.
I want to.
Wait.
- What was her name?
Your mother.
Sarah.
Her name was Sarah.
I'd like to say "my love" in Arabic.
I went to work.
Welcome back and have fun at the wedding.
Mazal Tov to your sister.
Don't tell him it's from me!
Come back to me quickly, very quickly.
- Did you sleep well?
- Like a log.
Me too.
Excuse me, is that lemon or lemonberry?
I don't see from here, but it's on the label.
How are you?
Remember what I told you yesterday?
I'm not sure.
I was totally freaked out.
I told you I wanted to marry you and have a lot of kids.
You told me I was drunk.
Remember?
More or less.
I love you.
I want us to live together.
What do you mean?
From one day to the next?
Yes.
But you don't really want us to get married?
Religious marriage and everything is not my thing!
You're the one who decides.
I don't mind.
I'm looking at your soaps.
No, not here.
I'm taking a jump at Erez's, buying bread.
I'll see you later.
You're cute.
Move forward.
Put the bags on the floor.
Come on!
Come on!
Open them so the soldier can control them.
Come on, show it all.
Get your papers out of here.
Excuse me, soldier, these people are coming to my sister's wedding.
- Could you...
- Who are they for you?
The guests of my sister who's getting married.
Where are you from?
From Nablus.
Hello, Ashraf.
Welcome to you.
Sorry about the wait.
Don't worry, it won't take long.
- You'll be there in time.
- Inch Allah!
What does he want?
I don't know.
Ashraf Sirtawi from Nablus.
What are you interfering with?
Get in line like the others.
- I just wanted to...
You understand Hebrew, don't you?
Get in the line before I stop you.
They're my sister's guests...
Get out!
Understood?
How are you, beautiful?
How's it going?
Jihad hasn't arrived yet.
Don't worry.
He'll be right back.
My mother-in-law has already come to tell me that we will have to give the name of Jihad's father to our son.
What son?
I have many other plans.
I'll graduate, I'll work, I'll get some money, I'll see you later.
Don't worry.
Today, you only have to think about your marriage.
- You think so?
- Yes.
What's going on with you?
- Nice shirt!
- Do you like it?
Where'd it come from?
From her?
Who is it?
I don't care.
Remember the TV crew?
The pretty French lady?
You're my sister, I can tell you.
Don't make it a Jordanian melodrama!
Is this French woman Jewish?
- Not Israeli, at least!
- No, it's not her...
It's him.
He's from Tel Aviv.
What about him?
He's a really great boy.
What's your point?
Don't you understand?
I love him.
You're the one who doesn't understand!
You're wrong.
What are these stories?
A Christian woman, a divorced woman, a French woman, and now, a boy, who put these ideas in your mind?
You're watching too many American movies.
- Why are you like that?
Why are you like that?
Did you go crazy?
Let's stop this conversation.
We need to come make-up.
If you love me, you should try to understand me.
It's up to you to understand me!
But we'll talk about it later.
You think it's gonna work?
It works well with me. I'm very moved when I sing.
- Who was that?
- Golan.
He's inflating me.
You're not nice to him.
He was adorable at the party.
- He's not hooking me up.
- Does he know?
- No.
- Tell him.
- He'll understand it by himself.
- You're a real bastard.
Tell him, he's not going to commit suicide.
Men are really cowards.
Please, no moral lessons.
It's the semifinal!
- Keep your advice.
- I don't understand that men are also emotionally late.
And you gays are the worst.
Call him now.
Set him up on a date and tell him.
Now!
All right.
Hey, honey.
I'm watching the semifinal of the pop music contest.
It's okay.
Can we have a cup of coffee later?
No, not "Orna and Ella" at Café Bialik.
Tonight, eight o'clock?
All right.
- Well?
- It works as planned.
Go upstairs, Samira's waiting for you up there.
Go talk to him.
Hello.
- How are you?
- Good, how about you?
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I...
- The stress of your sister's wedding?
- Probably.
What are you doing right now?
I'm taking my exams.
The level is not very high.
But I want to make architecture.
- Yeah?
Probably in London.
It's London, and the music is great there.
It's all over there.
Would you like to come too?
There's nothing to do here.
It's hopeless.
And you'd be far from Jihad and his crazy gang.
They're waiting for me to dance.
- See you later.
- All right.
You're dropping him off in Tel Aviv?
I can't hear anything.
We've been cut.
Will you drop it off in Tel Aviv?
God bless you!
I'll watch for the news on the radio.
Hello.
- An attack!
- Are you sure?
It wasn't far from here.
I'll check it out.
- Lulu, did you hear that?
- Ah, it's you.
It must have been a powerful bomb.
The whole building trembled.
I thought it was going to collapse.
Was there any damage?
No, I don't think so.
Where's Yali?
He had an appointment in a café with Golan.
I'll take you back, I've got a call.
Noam, it was Golan, he was late.
It was at Café Bialik.
Thank God you're here!
I mean alive!
Life and life.
You made us one of those fears!
- Are you sure you're okay?
No feeling, please.
I was admitted as a light injury.
I don't even hurt.
Except I don't feel my legs anymore.
They said it was the sedatives.
You'll be on your feet soon.
We're Yali's roommates.
Lulu and Noam.
It's good that you were able to come quickly.
For us, it was panic.
All lines were busy.
I didn't want to come directly.
My mom called a doctor friend.
That's how we knew.
Hello.
I'm so sorry.
I forgot my bag.
That's what made me late.
I didn't see the explosion.
I brought you flowers of your favorite color.
Is that him?
Answer me, he must be worried.
All right, I'll call him back.
Come on, come on!
Noam, where are you?
Answer me.
It jumped close to your house.
Is everyone okay?
Answer me, I'm worried.
I need to talk to you.
I told my sister everything.
I came out of the closet, as you say.
Call me back soon.
Even late.
I'll leave my phone on.
Hi, Hubi.
That's how they say "my love" in Arabic.
It's nice to serve me like coffee... and that sauce!
Shut up and eat.
- Tell me...
- We don't talk full mouth.
Seriously, why didn't we ever date?
What?
You heard me very well.
Is there a word you don't understand?
It's obvious, though.
I knew right away that you were the smartest guy I'd ever know.
You and I are for life.
Brothers to death.
Well, I don't think I'm gonna die this time.
But I like your answer, a nice answer.
You've always been able to talk to people.
- Hello.
- Have a good day!
Have a good day to the newlyweds!
- Thank you.
- Our best wishes for happiness!
I'm very happy.
You were a bride as beautiful as the ones we see on TV.
Thank you.
I was moved, I didn't greet anyone.
I didn't sleep.
We're not sleeping his wedding night!
You'll have plenty of time to sleep.
Stop or I'll shoot!
Don't shoot!
Let's catch him!
Don't be afraid, my love.
Don't be afraid.
I wanted to bring your coffee to bed.
You're making coffee, too?
Great.
You don't want it?
I'm a little muddy.
If anyone's nice to me, I start to doubt it.
Hello, Mom.
What happened?
We'll make orphans everywhere!
In every house!
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'll call you later.
Noam!
Violent riots in Nablus.
A general curfew has been imposed.
They started at the funeral of Rana Sirtawi, the daughter of a prominent townman who was accidentally killed in a military operation during the arrest of a terrorist linked to the Bialik Café bombing...
I can't believe it.
The bride happened to be in the firing line.
Hamas promised to avenge the death of the young wife of one of its local leaders.
Ashraf, answer me.
Call me, please.
I haven't been able to call you before.
Yali's hurt.
He was at Café Bialik.
I just saw the news on TV.
I hope that...
Call me.
Allah will avenge her.
We'll kill them by thousands!
They're gonna regret it.
We'll drive them all out of here.
My condolences.
We'll hunt them all the way to the last one.
We'll hunt all the Jews.
Father...
Would you like some tea?
Eat something?
My friend, I only have one thing to tell you.
Your daughter is a martyr.
We will avenge his death.
Thank God she died before she saw this!
I won't say anything.
Don't worry.
Samira is beautiful and she loves you.
Marry yourself and give grandchildren to your father.
I have to go.
- A little more.
- Like this?
Again.
Perfect.
- Is Rana's picture in the field?
Go on.
Are you sure you want to handle this mission yourself?
Yes.
Go on.
I, the future martyr, Jihad Nasser El-Din, a member of the brigades...
What are you doing here?
Take your place.
What do we offer him today?
A velvety double tomato, let there be some for Lulu, and a panacotta, his favorite dessert.
Coffee, in the meantime?
Double it, thank you.
- How's he doing?
He doesn't know yet that he won't walk anymore.
We're afraid to tell him.
Doctors say it can wait.
It's gonna be hard.
Ashraf?
What's the matter?
It's a weird feeling.
Like an electric shock.
I was very scared.
It's all right, little head.
Your panacotta's coming.
You're gonna enjoy it.
According to the authorities, a much worse tragedy was avoided when the terrorist suddenly turned around and blew up his charge in the deserted street.
Hubi, my love.
Let's get out of here.
Far from the smokes of war, it may be better.
There may be a paradise where we can love each other.
Maybe...
Have we ever had a chance?
One time, one moment?
Lulu and Yali are probably gonna give the press a picture of us.
The photo of the rave where we're on a small cloud.
Let people see how happy and beautiful we were.
Will they understand how ugly and stupid wars are?
