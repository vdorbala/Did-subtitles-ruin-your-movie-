All right, Abrams.
Allende.
Bernstein.
Brown.
Come on, come on.
Bravo, Todd.
Buckley.
Cohen.
Garcia.
Paul.
Sit down, Lisa.
I wanted to talk to you about your control.
Please.
I know we helped you.
I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean.
I'm just saying we helped you.
I'm not the only one.
Anyway...
I'll do it again, but I don't see the point.
These things will never be of any use to me in life.
You don't know that.
You've never been passionate about something you thought you had no interest in?
No, not really.
You've never been confronted with a new situation and found that by overcoming his difficulties, you've developed new skills and gained experience?
No, really.
All right.
Anyway, it was open book.
What's the difference between using a book and someone's brain who's good at math?
He didn't do everything for me.
- No?
- No, I made a part of it.
Next time, I'd like you to do it entirely.
All right?
You're very understanding.
What did he tell you?
Nothing.
Mr. Aaron and I agree with my aversion to math.
The President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorizes the use of private detectives to suppress the strike. They went there and muzzled them.
Like Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Because they didn't care!
They didn't care!
There you go.
There's not much to add.
All right?
Go on.
- Becky...
- Well...
Mr. Klein.
Has there ever been a good president of the United States?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
What do you think?
You.
Lionel, what do you think?
Have we had a good president?
I don't know.
I think most of them were corrupt.
Lisa?
I do not have much admiration for the Presidents of the United States, especially for the current one.
Nevertheless, I believe that it is counterproductive to classify them all as corrupt a priori, it would be generalizing.
Especially if we judge them from the traditional idea of a president in a mythical version of America that probably never existed.
Lisa raised an important point.
Tell him to be polite, answer questions, and I'll get him released on bail in the morning.
Hey, you okay?
Hey, Darren.
It went well.
Thank you very much.
Didn't he give you a soap?
He knows I'm never going to study math.
He was very understanding.
- He's super cool.
- Yes, Mr. Aaron likes everyone.
What does that mean?
Nothing.
That he's a charming man.
Where were you going?
I need to find a cowboy hat.
Why?
My father takes me and my brother to a ranch in New Mexico, and we don't ride horses in New Mexico without the right riding range.
You can't understand.
- That's very likely.
- Anyway, thank you.
Before you start looking for a cowboy hat...
- Yes, Darren?
- What are you doing next?
- Tonight, for example.
- I don't know.
How about a movie?
Are you offering me a date?
No, not a date, just a movie.
I don't know if it's a date.
All right.
Calm down.
What do you want to see?
I don't even know what's on the bill.
I don't know if it's a date.
Forget it.
Besides, I don't like movies.
That's bullshit.
All right, calm down.
I'm so sorry.
I was asking!
What if it's a date?
Would that be so awful?
Oh, my God.
You're...
You want to go out with me?
- I don't know.
- Tell me.
Yes.
I mean...
- We're already very close...
- Oh, my God.
...and I think we'd make a nice couple.
I think I need to think about it.
That's right.
Think about it.
All right.
I promise.
Great.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- What do you want from me?
All right.
See you later.
All right.
Hey!
Hello.
- Is Mom here?
- She's out.
- Hey!
- What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.
Darren wants us to go to the movies.
Oh, my God.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Becky, there's not a cowboy hat all over the Upper West Side.
I'm on the verge of depression.
You can say thank you to the Upper West Side, because no one wants to see you with that hat.
Hey!
Hey!
- Where did you...
- Hey.
Your hat!
- What?
- Where did you buy it?
What?
Are you crazy?
Hello.
Where did you buy your hat?
- My hat?
- Yes!
The cowboy hat!
Do you like it?
Really?
Yes!
Where did you buy it?
Are there any witnesses?
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance.
Back off, I'll call him!
- Ma'am?
- An ambulance!
- Someone's on it.
- Can you hear me?
- Can you hear me?
- I don't know.
Where am I?
Broadway and 75th in New York.
Between 75th and 74th.
- You had an accident.
- Who are you?
- My name is Lisa.
- What do you mean?
I'm dead?
No, you're not dead.
You had an accident, but it's okay...
I don't understand.
What happened?
- You were hit by a bus.
- Are you kidding me?
- A bus?
- Yes.
- Is anyone a doctor?
- Is this the accident again?
- The ambulance's coming.
- The accident's over.
- You're confused.
- I think so.
There.
Let me try...
- No!
Don't let go of me.
- Ma'am!
- Don't let go of me.
- I'm not letting you go.
I promise.
I won't let you go.
Thank you.
Without a garrote, she'll die.
Let me...
Oh, my God!
Goddamn it!
Help.
What's going on with me?
I'm so sorry.
I'm trying to put you down with a garrote.
We need to put you down with a withers.
Use your seat belt.
I don't know where.
It's okay, hold on.
Thank you.
Don't let go of me.
They're going to put you in a withers.
Are they doctors?
No, they're not doctors.
They're passers-by.
- I don't want them to touch me!
Ma'am, ma'am!
We're trying to help you!
Forget it!
Wrap it up...
You want to do it for me?
Stop!
I can't see anything.
Are my eyes open or closed?
They're open.
What do you mean?
You had a serious accident.
But you're gonna make it, so resist.
There's no room to put it on.
I can't find...
Call a fucking ambulance, for Christ's sake!
Calm down!
We've already called her!
Obviously, she's not coming, so call them back.
Call them back.
- It's okay.
- Someone...
Could you call my daughter?
Of course.
What's her name?
Tell me his name or his number.
Lisa.
That's my name.
Is that your daughter's name?
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to confuse you.
My name is Lisa.
Your daughter too?
Just call her, one point, that's all!
For that, you have to give me his number.
That's it.
It's done!
Ma'am?
- It's okay.
- It's gonna be okay!
Your daughter's number?
Sweetheart,
- I think I'm gonna die.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The ambulance will be here in a minute.
Hold on, all right?
- Please.
- Stop.
- She's dead.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
- She's dead.
- Let go of me.
Please, let go of me!
Hold on.
They'll be here any minute.
Resist!
It's okay.
- Did you respect the limits?
Lisa, right?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Of course.
Tell me everything you've seen, even if you think it's insignificant.
Imagine a film that scrolls - in your head...
- The light was green.
- Can you call my mother?
- We called her, but I'm telling them to try again, okay?
I know it's hard, but I have to enjoy it while it's still fresh.
Some questions will seem absurd to you.
No.
Put them down!
That's what I do.
All right?
Here's my question: Where were you from, did you see the lights?
Was the light red?
Orange?
Green?
Did she come out of nowhere?
What color was the fire?
I'm sorry, I...
- I think it was green.
It was an accident.
- Where have you been?
- On Broadway.
- What happened to you?
Hey?
Do we know who this woman is?
I don't know.
She was supposed to live in the area, and she was carrying her groceries.
- What did they do with his leg?
- I don't know!
Hey...
Are you sure you don't want me to call?
No, thank you.
Thank you.
That's nice.
But I have an appointment with Becky anyway, and I don't want to spend the night here ruminating this.
Go to work.
- Hey.
- Hey, Darren.
Hello.
- Joan?
- Yes?
- You got flowers.
- Can you bring them?
Good.
I'm glad you liked it.
You were great.
There's still work, but it'll be fine.
The critics will love it.
They completely forgot me.
- Are you going out with us?
- I don't know.
I'll check it out.
- Come on.
- Maybe.
I don't know either.
Probably.
- See you later.
- Hey.
- Have a good night.
- See you later.
Hello, are you Ramon?
Yes.
Good evening.
Again, you've been wonderful.
That's nice.
And thank you for the beautiful bouquet.
- Please.
- Have you seen the play before?
Yeah, twice.
Yeah.
That's a lot!
It's a very nice show.
You'll be very successful, I'm sure.
For now, we're focusing on what we're doing.
You may already have plans, but could I buy you a drink?
If you want to invite your friends...
- I'm sorry, I was coming home.
- It's not a problem.
Tomorrow, I'm leaving for a few days in London.
When I get back, maybe?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Excuse me.
I really have to go.
- No problem.
But thanks again for the flowers!
- It's an honor to meet you.
- Good evening.
- Goodbye.
Hello.
- I thought you were in the movies.
- It wasn't terrible.
I was giving a show in Detroit, and a woman comes behind the scenes:
"Are we going to my place to get some cocaine?"
I'm like, "I know this kind of good woman..."
What the hell are you doing here at 4:00 in the morning?
I'll have us thrown away.
Make Shirley Temple!
Come on, do Shirley Temple.
All right.
On Lollipop, my beautiful boat
To the confectionery carry me the waves
And there you are.
Landing in chocolate
If you eat too much
Oh!
Oh!
You're gonna...
Keep going.
That's great!
Wait, what was that?
Make the baby.
- No, it's too creepy.
- You have to make the baby.
I'm focusing.
- That's troubling.
Too much?
- No, I don't.
- Take a drink.
I think it's obvious, I've had enough.
Matthew, you will interpret the King of France.
Anthony, why not the Duke of Burgundy?
The Duke of Burgundy.
I think I'll be King Lear again.
All right, Anthony?
"Your Majesty, I demand nothing more than this Your Highness has offered,
"and you will grant no less."
"Very noble Bourguignon,
"as long as it has been dear to us, we have estimated it at this price.
"But its value has fallen."
My family is from Colombia.
My father worked in the diplomatic corps.
Is that true?
As a child, I lived five years in Panama and then nine in Paris.
And what are you doing in life?
I own a company.
We design software to help South American companies that use incompatible software, to get their computers to communicate.
This is a major problem in South America, where computer communication coordination is lacking.
This is a good time for business, because for large software publishers, the region is still untapped.
And it's moving very fast.
Shall I take you home?
No, thanks, I'll take a cab.
But thank you.
Can I call you?
Yes.
Of course, with pleasure.
Can I get your number?
- Mom?
- Wait a minute!
- Can I come in?
- Wait a second.
Come in.
Can I talk to you?
Of course.
What's going on?
I have to go back to the precinct to confirm my statement the day after tomorrow.
What do you think I have to do?
I don't know, honey.
The bus driver certainly has a dependent family.
He might lose his place.
I think you should think about it before you say anything.
All right?
Yes.
Think about the implications of what you're saying.
What is the general framework of reference for the Middle Arab?
Angie.
Yes.
My mother's family comes from Syria, they don't support the regime.
I condemn most of their religious principles, especially with regard to the oppression of women.
But I mean, the Americans are far from imagining how hated they are.
I don't think so.
For my parents in Syria, what we did in Afghanistan is terrorism.
- Anthony?
- Iraq, let's not talk about it.
Syria is a military theocratic dictatorship.
- No.
I'm sorry.
Isn't that a military theocratic dictatorship?
I think we understand how much people hate us.
No.
They destroyed the city.
- I don't care.
- You're wrong.
Those who destroyed the World Trade Center are crazy.
- Some crazy people?
- Yes!
Because they're Arabs?
3,000 dead for no reason!
For them, yes!
- Which one?
- One at a time!
- Why'd you bomb them?
- We don't have a choice!
- Invade them?
- They declared war.
Iraq has not declared war on anyone.
- They didn't do anything to us!
- Please, one at a time!
- Anthony.
- They had a reason.
Thank you.
Establish a medieval Islamic caliphate in the Middle East and destroy Western civilization.
- Where'd you read that?
- On their website.
- All right, forget it.
- Angie!
- No, that's enough.
- Say what you meant.
No!
Why?
You're defending the killers of 3,000 people?
No!
You defend a country that has unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries and supports Israel against Palestine.
Oh, please.
Who bombards women and children, then treats terrorists as those who do the same.
- It's not the same!
- Yes!
- Calm down.
- Lionel!
Go on.
One question: how would bombing men be less serious than bombing women and children?
Isn't that reverse sexism?
I don't know.
But it's an idiotic term.
- That's ridiculous.
- Monica!
I think we should all apologize to Angie, and she just expressed her opinion on the analysis of her Syrian parents.
You all assaulted her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!
That's what they are!
They disfigure women with acid!
- The Afghanists?
- Bomb the Klan!
Oh, no, they're white!
There are six of us who want to intervene.
- Calm down.
- They say "Afghans."
I don't mean you're wrong.
But I find your way of treating Angie pathetic, because she expresses an opinion contrary to yours.
It's censorship, isn't it?
- No?
- It's not censorship!
- That's right!
- We're not the government!
- It's censorship.
- I'm dreaming!
We're working on Highway One in the Bronx.
Not far from the zoo.
- I see.
- But for that kind of thing...
Hey, you okay?
In such situations, a local police station or an apartment is used.
Anything that can speed things up.
Sit where you want.
Take a chair.
You said the light was green when the bus crossed the crossroads.
Yes.
So she shouldn't have crossed?
Yes.
That's right.
Two years in college, two years in the paper.
Two years with you.
I'm two years old!
You think that's funny?
What did you think of the play?
That was good.
- Hello?
- Hey, Dad.
Hey!
- How are you?
- Good.
I'm looking at the ocean, I'm trying to work a little bit, I'm listening to music.
- What about you?
- It's okay.
Do you work your horse?
I'm not stopping.
I caught some saddle wounds.
- Really?
- No, I was kidding.
Ah, okay.
You know.
Claremont Stables on 89th, between Columbus and Amsterdam?
- Maybe you could take a few lessons.
- No...
- I'd be happy...
I'm sorry, go ahead.
I'd be happy to offer them to you, if you like.
I think it would be worth it.
Thank you, maybe I'll take your advice.
- That's nice of you.
- How's school?
Not bad.
I'm pretty bad at geometry.
Not to the point of compromising your scholarship, I hope?
- No.
Don't worry.
- Good.
The maths were never my fort either, so...
I guess I'm following your tracks.
I'm proud to hear it.
Other than that, how are you?
Good.
Business is pretty good.
They're slowing down a bit, it's vaguely frustrating.
But we're working on one or two promising projects.
So here you go, I think it's okay.
Great.
What about your love?
Oh, always the same.
- No one...
- They're all the same.
You may not be interested, but our next workshop will be almost entirely made up of young, handsome and strong men in the 17 years who seem to want to use their brains to advance life.
No one understands how this could have happened, but if you want to meet them when you come...
I'm not flashing too much about the Californian guy, but thank you.
Neither do I, at the beginning.
But it depends on the person.
Imparable.
You convinced me to stop generalizing.
I think I told you everything, honey.
I'll call you in a week or two.
- Kiss Curtis for me.
- All right.
- I love you.
- Me too.
Hello.
- You know I have two kids?
- Yes.
I'd like to meet them.
You're very supple.
I have two boys, too.
It's not flexibility.
Would you like to have a last drink?
I...
I felt like we were very close until a few days ago, but now I feel you're distant.
Becky, give me a break.
Now, the other nostril, it has to be symmetrical.
It's very important.
You're funny.
Symmetry.
All right, now what?
- Let's kiss.
- Paul!
What about your girlfriend?
Excuse me?
I thought you were telling me about my girlfriend.
Don't be careful.
I don't know.
I don't want to get involved.
You know I love you?
Not really.
I have to go home.
I'm gonna go, too.
You want me to help you?
Joan, are you all right?
Yes.
I'll be right there.
Let's start with some stretching.
First, you'll look at me and then you'll do the same.
All right, we'll raise the left arm.
Then we lean on the side, you'll feel the whole flank pull and lie down.
Good.
- Mr. Aaron?
- Yes, Becky...
Lisa?
Are you still mad at me?
What's going on?
The bus driver may be wiped out, and I'll be the rich little girl who calls the cops to relieve her consciousness.
What does that have to do with your money?
- You know what I mean.
I mean richer than the bus driver.
Lionel?
Five minutes.
We're pretty many in the hallway and we're running out of air.
Close the door.
I'm sorry, I have to let them in.
I don't want to let you down.
If you feel bad, we can have coffee after class.
- I'd love to.
Does this dress make me fat?
A little.
I can't help it.
Where are you going?
To the opera.
Why?
Ramon loves it.
I think it's nice.
We could all go together.
No, thank you.
- You'd like that.
- I don't like that way of singing.
You like classical music.
Yeah, but not the opera.
- You didn't...
- Looks like they only exist to show off their vocal power.
I don't see the point.
Maybe, but we don't have to generalize.
You love The Magic Flute.
All right.
So I was wrong.
I like opera, thanks for opening my eyes.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Why are you insisting?
I don't want to go!
All right!
I don't insist.
All you had to do was say, "No, thank you."
You asked me why.
I told you, and you dismantled my reasoning, like I'm talking without thinking, when it's all the opposite!
Okay, that was insulting to me.
I don't like opera either, but I'm trying to open up, is it wrong?
Why do you let us influence Curtis and me so much?
Your meeting with Ramon makes me nervous.
Why?
Why am I irritating you so much?
I didn't say anything!
Okay, say something, and I'll answer you the way you've been answering me since the beginning of the conversation.
- Go on, say something...
- It's out of the question!
- Why not?
- That's stupid!
I'm abhorrent.
I get it.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Did you imitate me?
All right, I'll take it off.
Are you coming to my premiere tonight?
If you have to.
- You're a little bitch.
- I got you.
Let's stop talking to each other like that.
You're the one who started it.
- Excuse me...
- No, it's refreshing.
If you don't realize you're nervous or irritable with me, whatever the exact term, you understand me very well.
- No.
If you pretend you don't realize it, then you're not sincere.
Maybe I'm a horrible mother without realizing it.
I'm nervous about the first one in two weeks, I'm dating a man and I'd like you to like him, you just had a traumatic accident, you're going on a horse trip with your father...
- Please!
- ...that terrorizes me.
And besides, ever since I told you about Ramon, you've been treating me like crazy.
- You're exaggerating.
- What should I do?
- Yeah?
- Stop whining for everything!
It doesn't matter!
You've played in a lot of plays and you're always freaking out for what the critics will say from your play to the fuck!
I don't care about Ramon or your guy this week.
I'm not dating anyone.
- I don't care!
- Be polite!
I haven't had anyone in two years!
I don't care!
It doesn't matter.
Your boyfriend, your play, everybody doesn't care.
I don't care about New Mexico, and actually, I probably won't.
- What?
- And you know what?
There are bigger problems than our relationship.
People die every day in this town, we don't care if I like your boyfriend!
It's completely insignificant.
Don't give me that shit!
Shall I get him up?
Or do I tell him to wait downstairs?
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.
I don't even understand what we're talking about.
That's the problem.
Leave me alone.
Is everything okay?
Yes.
I'm delighted to go to the opera.
I only went there once or twice.
Too bad it's Norma, but it's still a good show.
Why don't we go see something else?
- You don't want to hear Norma?
But it would be fun to get in somewhere else.
Why don't we go see Daniel Goldfarb's play?
I think you'll like it.
It's beautiful.
What a stupid book!
- Hello.
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey.
- It's Lisa Cohen.
Yeah, you okay?
Good.
What's up?
I've seen some questionable movies, and I still wonder what college to choose.
Nice.
I was wondering...
It's gonna sound weird to you, but would you mind delusionalizing me?
All right.
Really?
What do I owe this honor?
My deep and passionate feelings for you, Paul.
That's what I was thinking.
Can you give me your address?
252 West, 85th Street.
All right.
I'll be here in half an hour.
- or more.
- See you.
- Hey.
- Hello?
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- My talk about Lear.
Impressive.
Not really.
I'm not going to do that to you.
Did you have a good night?
Actually, Darren, I don't really want to talk right now.
All right.
All right?
Yeah, I'll call you later.
All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, come in.
I irritated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.
Did she tell you anything?
That the elevator was non-smoking.
Original.
Here's the living room.
- That's lovely.
- Do you like it?
My mother didn't open any of those books.
What about you?
A few.
Not all of them.
That's a great book.
The Third Reich is a little above my strength right now.
You'd eat it.
Can I get you something to drink?
A beer.
They're in the kitchen.
Here's my room.
Ta-dam.
Very nice.
These are some of my drawings.
I shouldn't show them to you.
You're a gifted artist, aren't you?
I wish I were.
But I'd call myself a good cartoonist.
I'm doing this for the pleasure.
But I've always been passionate about it.
- Can I ask you something?
It's gonna sound immature to you, but how do you feel about being so relaxed knowing what we're gonna do?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
It was an idiotic question, and now I'd like to go underground.
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
If you want to go home, I'll understand.
Calm down.
Don't be embarrassed.
It's the greatest activity in the world, but there's nothing to worry about.
In general, I'm not nervous because I think you have to, but because it's stronger than I am.
That's good.
You're funny.
Do you have an ashtray?
You can throw it out the window.
How am I supposed to do this?
Swipe the little door there...
Like this?
Yes.
Do I have to speed up at the end?
Yeah, but we'll do other things before that.
Come on.
You don't have to.
I know.
I want to.
Don't do it.
I don't like it.
- Let me do it to you.
- All right.
Any advice?
Go easy on it.
All right.
You ready?
Yes.
All right.
It's a delicate moment.
Maybe it'll hurt a little, but it'll pass.
Be patient.
There are technical difficulties that need to be solved, otherwise it won't work.
All right.
You look like a fool.
All right, ready?
Yes.
All right.
All right, hold on.
All right, let's go.
Does it hurt?
A little, yes.
Try to relax.
It's going to pass quickly.
Did you bring a condom?
- Shouldn't you put it on?
- In a minute.
- It really hurts.
- Wait a second.
- I love you.
- What?
Nothing.
All right.
Wait.
- Shit.
- What?
Wait a second.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I missed it.
- Do I have any inside?
- I don't know.
Yes.
And not a little.
It should be okay.
The risks are very low.
He's my little brother.
- Hey, Curtis.
- Hey.
I loved it.
It was beautiful.
But why did people yell "bravi" and "brava"?
- What do you mean?
- It's pretentious.
"Bravi, bravi." Can't they say "bravo"?
It's the plural.
They want to show that they congratulate the whole.
I know it's fair, but don't you think there's something pretentious about it?
- Pretentious?
- I'm not saying they didn't take advantage of it, but as we enjoy a show while looking at the others from the corner of the eye because we know they're watching us?
Yeah, but I wouldn't say it's pretentious.
In Italian, they say "bravo" for a man, "brava" for a woman and "bravi" for the whole troupe.
All right.
We use the masculine for the singer and the feminine for the singer.
Anyway, I loved it.
Thank you.
We'll have to go back.
It was beautiful.
Accident investigation, Detective Mitchell.
My name is Lisa Cohen.
I witnessed an accident a few weeks ago.
Hello, Lisa.
What can I do for you?
Can you give me the coordinates of the victim's family?
I'd like to see flowers, or is that a reserved information?
No, the family was informed.
I'll see what I got.
She said something about a girl.
Wait a minute.
Are you all right?
It's okay.
Here, wait...
No girls are mentioned.
The only contact I have is a cousin, Abigail Berwitz.
- I have a number in Arizona.
- All right.
520-5555.
I'm looking for Abigail Berwitz.
- It's me.
My name is Lisa Cohen.
You don't know me.
Yes?
It's about your cousin, Monica Patterson.
Yes?
I was there when she got...
I didn't know her, but I held her hands.
Yes?
What can I do for you?
Well...
I've seen the obituary report.
Can you stop for five minutes?
I have to practice!
I don't care!
Excuse me.
He wasn't talking about a funeral.
I guess it happened.
I think it's next week, but...
I'm sorry, I was wondering...
Did she say she had a daughter?
- No.
- She wanted us to call her...
No.
His daughter died a long time ago.
Oh, my God.
- Was she sick?
- She had leukemia.
Oh, my God.
- I can...
- I'm gonna hang up.
Who gave you that number?
It's harassment!
That's not my intention!
I've been getting these kinds of calls for three weeks, but know I had nothing to do with Monica.
You should call Emily Morrison, Monica's friend.
She's the one who takes care of everything in New York.
I have nothing to do with this.
Excuse me!
I didn't know who to contact.
I'll give you his number, but I'd like to have someone stop calling me.
Yes...
- I'll take some writing.
Go on.
There you go.
Hello, are you Lisa?
- Yes.
As you probably know,
Monica didn't believe in God.
Everyone who attended a wedding or funeral with her knows what she thought of solemn occasions.
So Harry, Elise and I talked about it and decided to bring everyone together and allow anyone who wanted to talk about her.
To share some memories.
Some of you know each other, others don't.
But we're all here because we loved Monica.
and to pay tribute to her in a way that would not make her enraged.
I don't have the right to tell you what to think or feel, and I don't want to epilogue on the absurd way she died, it would give her nausea, but I don't want it to become the summary of her life,
Because it's not.
When her Lisa died... I told her:
"How can you handle this?" She said, "I can't stand it,
"but I don't want to take away his twelve years of life
"By summarising them with leukemia, it would be unworthy."
So I think it's important to remind us that, even if it was torn from us, it remains the most complete person I've ever known.
It was also unbearable, but it's another story.
Well, I said what I had to say.
Now I'd like to talk about our first meeting.
She was 21.
It's okay, Emily.
I know.
I had 19.
I realize that my kids have a hard time imagining that I was young.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, you okay?
Well, how about you?
I'm sitting and listening to music, a beer in my hand.
Sounds nice.
Yes.
How are you?
What about your love?
I knew a boy, but he has a girlfriend, so...
I realize I'm irresistible.
That's right.
You're lucky, you're beautiful and smart.
- So dangerous.
- You're forgetting "moor."
Not too ripe, I hope.
- No, don't worry.
- Good.
Excellent answer.
I don't think it'll last.
So you know what?
Don't do anything.
Don't do anything.
There are two alternatives:
either he will begin to do the impossible to draw your attention, or you will make it clear to him that if he does not, he will not have it.
- I think he knows I like him.
All right...
I think I confessed to him.
That's all the better.
If you suddenly stop paying attention to him, I guarantee you he's going to go crazy and forget his girlfriend, unless he's not interested.
In which case you'll have to make a reason, even if it's hard.
Thank you.
I'll try this the next time I see him.
It's all right here.
- Slow down, but...
- Actually, Dad?
Yes?
I have something serious to ask you.
All right.
I seek the views of the people I respect.
What's going on?
You think I should change my statement?
First of all, I'm glad you're telling me.
I'd like to call a lawyer friend to get an idea of the consequences.
We could talk about it over the phone, all three of us...
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.
Don't call anyone.
- Did you get my message?
- I got one.
- Hello?
- Excuse me.
About the flowers for my mother?
Wait a minute.
Annette just got here.
Excuse me.
Please.
Who are you talking to?
I don't think that's the case so far.
I don't want to make this terrible death my moral school...
Are you referring to Shaw?
- What?
- Shaw's big quote.
"The English see the world
"like their personal moral school."
It's in one of his prefaces.
I forgot where I read it.
- Who is it?
- Lisa.
You can ask her...
- Anyway...
Excuse me, Lisa.
Hold on.
Yes?
Ask if there's anything she doesn't eat for the trip.
I have to call the ranch, they're cooking meals.
- in advance.
- All right.
But we're in the middle of a conversation.
Karl, I'm a week late.
You promised to call her.
If I hear about this ranch again, I'm going crazy.
We're in the middle of a conversation.
What do you want me to do?
If they plan things she doesn't eat, she won't have anything to eat.
- I'm gonna ask him...
- Last time we went to three restaurants, and she...
I'll ask him.
As soon as we're done.
Say hi to her for me.
All right.
Hello?
Yes.
Hello.
Mom?
Monica!
There's someone for you.
Hello.
I'm sorry to bother you.
We've never met before.
What can I do for you?
Remember me?
I don't know.
What's this about?
Can I talk to you for a moment?
About what?
I don't understand.
Just the accident.
I don't want anything and I don't want to hurt you.
I just want to talk to you about it.
Who gave you my address?
The information.
I was gonna warn you, but...
It would have been better.
We were gonna sit down.
I don't see what...
All right.
Let's go out.
Can I go to the bathroom?
- No, let's go out.
- Gerry, let her go.
I don't want to.
I don't understand what she wants.
Down the hall, honey.
Kids, calm down!
I'm not kidding.
- What's the matter?
- Who is it?
She attended the accident.
She needed the bathroom.
Who is it?
- Wait for us inside.
- No, I want to hear it.
Look, we...
All right.
What?
All right.
I don't want you to feel insulted.
Insulted?
I was wondering how you felt.
- In relation to the accident?
- Yes.
You're upset about the accident?
Yes!
I'm upset about the accident.
Completely upset.
And I wanted to talk about it.
Does that sound weird to you?
- Why don't we go home?
- Can I talk to you alone?
Is anyone telling me what's going on?
Nothing.
Calm down.
Go home and let me talk to him.
Meanwhile, make sure the kids don't kill each other.
All right.
You know what?
Let them kill each other.
It'll give us some rest.
Okay, Lisa.
What?
I...
- I want you to know...
- Yes?
What?
Talk.
You certainly know that I said it was an accident.
Yes.
Yes, it was.
That is to say...
You didn't do it on purpose.
- Expropriate?
- But to tell you the truth...
What?
What?
Go on.
What?
Well...
We were looking at each other.
Who, you and me?
Yes.
Not in the romantic sense of the word.
- Romantic?
- Forget it, it doesn't matter.
I don't follow you very well.
If you let me...
What I remember from the accident was that you were wearing a cowboy hat, and I was just looking for one.
I was giving you signs, and you were answering me.
And...
I know I was distracting you, but I saw the bus burn the red light.
before you overthrow that woman.
All right.
- I'm a little lost.
- No one said it, but I wanted you and I to admit it.
What do you mean by "signs"?
- You wanted to go upstairs?
- No.
Yes.
I was probably warning you to get away from the bus.
Because if the bus was on the move, that's what I would have done for your safety.
Don't you remember giving me signs?
Not really.
No.
I don't think we remember the same thing.
- Your brother's on the phone.
- Tell him I'll call back.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
That would be impossible, because I didn't do anything wrong.
There was no fault.
That's all.
That's the final report.
You won't change it?
That's how it happened.
Otherwise, I would admit it.
It's a tragedy, but the brakes on these buses are slowly reacting.
It's a physical limit of the vehicle.
I don't know what else to tell you.
It was a shock.
But you won't bring her back.
I'm not talking about that.
But to tell the investigators what really happened.
You've already talked to them!
- I know.
But I lied.
I understand you didn't want any trouble...
Then why did you lie?
While they were questioning me, I felt like we were looking at each other like saying,
"Don't tell them the truth."
Now I'm not following you at all.
I can't prove anything.
Did I tell you something?
Did I threaten you?
No!
I'm not accusing you of anything!
I'm just saying I lied to the police, and I wanted to talk to you before I went back.
You told them what you saw!
Like me!
But I was driving!
- Calm down.
- Don't get involved.
You want to ruin my life?
Tell them we were watching each other and I was wearing a cowboy hat?
But you'll take your little life back, while I'll lose my place.
Who will take care of my family?
You?
You'll do it?
And all this for what?
She's dead!
I can't do anything to bring her back!
I want to tell the truth.
Do whatever you want.
The cops will laugh at you in the face, 'cause it's not my fault.
It's both our fault.
Don't repeat that again without a lawyer.
- Give me your phone number.
- Your number.
- No!
Why?
You show up at my house, and I can't reach you?
- Gerry, calm down...
- All right!
212-5...
Wait.
Go on.
555-0157.
What's it gonna do for you?
Whatever you say.
Find a good lawyer.
Why are you doing this?
He was traumatized.
Almost as much as having a leg ripped out.
I don't understand.
I think I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.
You didn't know what to do?
- I know, it's not brilliant.
- Brilliant?
I know you're trying to fix it.
What does your mother say?
She wasn't very helpful to me.
- What do you mean?
- She's got her problems, she hasn't been too interested in it.
What kind of problems?
- The first of her shows.
- His show?
What show?
She's playing in a room.
All right.
All right.
I have a lawyer friend, I'll call him, and you'll talk to the police.
- You want me to come with you?
- No, thank you.
You want to ask your mom to do it?
I can handle myself.
She's become suspicious.
How to draw him into the office without...
What do you think?
Let me tell you something, Eliot.
If you want to fire me, go ahead.
Stop flirting around me like a disoriented dancer every time we meet!
Do you have anything to tell me?
You're not fired?
Oh...
What were you talking about?
An attempted suicide bombing took place in Jerusalem on Wednesday...
No, Lisa read it for me.
No.
I only read them if I'm sure they're good.
You do?
You're brave and stupid.
Victor, don't talk to me like that.
You know I...
Spring and Fall, to a Young Child, by Gerard Manley Hopkins.
"Margaret, do you cry the booze that fades?
"Paths, like human things
"In your fresh thoughts, can you care?
"Ah, as your heart grows old
"Similar colder shows, he will soon see, without pushing a sigh
"While worlds of wood blemish the ground
"Here you will cry and you will know why.
"No matter what the name is, my child.
"The sources of sorrows are alike
"Neither the mouth nor the mind has expressed
"What the heart perceived, the soul guessed
"It is to the wilt that man is destined
"It's Margaret who's crying."
Any comment?
Lisa?
Can I help you?
Is Detective Mitchell here?
No.
He told me he'd be here after 3:00.
He's not home yet.
Can I help you?
Do you know when he'll be back?
What's this about?
I witnessed an accident and filled out a statement with him, but I wanted to change it.
What do you mean?
What do you want to change?
I forgot one thing and I wanted to tell her, because...
I don't understand.
- You're changing your statement?
- Yes!
Yes, I want to change my statement.
Yes.
In this case, you need to talk to the inspector responsible for the investigation.
Yes.
That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell.
He told me he'd be here, but...
- Do you know the number of the investigation?
It's the one on Monica Patterson, crushed by a bus on Broadway.
- We've talked a lot about it...
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- The investigation is closed.
I don't know.
But if she is, it's partly because of my statement, and I...
- From your statement?
Filed because of your statement?
- I was the...
- The D.A. closes the case.
Not you.
The D.A.
I didn't mean to say that I had classified it legally myself, but I probably had it there.
- What's your name, honey?
Lisa Cohen.
- Good.
- Don't call me "honey."
All right.
You're upset now?
- What's your name?
- Lisa Cohen!
Okay, Lisa, first of all, you're gonna calm down.
- I'm calm.
- Good.
Then...
There he is, your knight in his glittering armor.
- Is he leading you to a hard life?
So you're saying he burned the fire.
Yes.
He didn't even look at the road.
I admit I was trying to get his attention.
All right.
Before you do anything, know that burning a red light is not a criminal act.
Even in the event of accidental death, that's right.
In order for a criminal act to occur, the law says that two aggravating circumstances are required.
For example: "He burned the red light and he was speeding up."
- Or...
- So he won't be prosecuted for manslaughter or second degree murder?
No.
He could be charged with reckless conduct or false testimony,
- which is very serious...
- That's amazing!
What was he supposed to do?
Kill her deliberately?
Yes.
That's the definition of murder.
Kill someone deliberately.
You're not implying that he deliberately crushed her.
Yes?
Yes?
No.
Listen...
I'll take your statement back.
- We'll check it out.
- You're kidding.
No, I'll talk to the chief brigadier, we'll re-examine the driver.
We'll put him under a little pressure.
We'll see what he says.
Thank you.
The Conservatory Garden-machin-thing has put 800 km of horrific fences all around the park, which is in total contradiction with its original vocation.
We'll never see the game.
- Oh, my God, it's John.
- Hey, John.
Hey, John.
You want some?
I mean, girls.
Smoking a firecracker by going to a football game organized by the school?
- Stop!
- I'm sorry!
We're so sorry.
Did you hear how he said "smoking a firecracker"?
"You can't smoke a firecracker."
"Come on, we're all going to John's to smoke a firecracker."
- Good morning, Mr. Aaron.
- Lisa, how are you?
Great.
What about you?
It's okay.
Tell me, where are you thinking about your problem?
I'm working on it.
I'll tell you.
- What's a bike?
- Off-road.
I have to ride a horse with my dad on Christmas holidays and I was wondering if it's comparable to a bike.
Not that I know, no.
But you must have done a lot of horse riding.
Why do you say that?
You're not Texas or Wyoming, a place like this?
- A place like what?
- Not New York.
I'm from Indiana.
But I don't want to hit you with superfluous details.
And you're teaching geometry at a private school in New York to a bunch of privileged liberal Jews?
Well...
I came to teach, and that's what I do.
So you think you've reached the peak of your ambitions?
Is that a real question or a Lisa question?
Half-half.
- In that case...
- Before you leave, I'm thinking about buying one, can I try it, just for a second?
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Wait, I'll fix the saddle.
- You keep my bag?
- Yes.
Oh, hi.
Where have you been?
I didn't know if you were having dinner.
No, thank you.
I'll order something.
A certain Emily called.
And Detective Mitchell, from the accident investigation squad.
Is that the one who got us?
What's going on?
Did you go back there?
I'd rather not talk about it when you're about to leave, if you don't mind.
All right.
- I'm going.
- Good show.
Thank you.
Dave, Lisa.
- Hey.
- You okay?
So...
Dave's one of my best friends.
He's an excellent lawyer, and if he can't help us, he'll know who to advise us.
Great.
When someone gets killed, it's called a homicide trial. It's a procedure that comes within the scope of laws passed by a legislative power, which allow an action to be taken.
Unlike what?
In the case of jurisprudential law, handed down by the judges, hence the limited damage.
- I don't understand.
- Skip the preambles.
We're not interested.
I thought we wanted him arrested.
- No, the police don't...
- Why?
They said they'd reopen the case.
Even if they do, the police won't advise the prosecutor to charge him.
- What can we do?
- I can do it.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- It's okay, I can do it.
To take action, you have to be a parent...
She only had these idiots in Arizona!
Wait.
A parent or his executor...
- I'm his executor.
Emily, I know.
The executor may sue for homicide, but the beneficiary must be a parent.
Let me explain.
In a homicide trial, one can sue for suffering, financial loss, subsidies, services or what is called "care, comfort and company", the advice of a parent whose children
- I don't understand.
Who are we attacking?
The driver?
No, because he doesn't have any money.
We're chasing them all to increase our chances.
It's probably MTA's insurance that will pay for it.
But the driver will be fired?
Not necessarily.
Even if the facts are disclosed?
- Maybe.
I don't know.
- How much can they be convicted?
- Depends on...
- To what extent can you affect them?
If she has been alive and suffered for a long time, compensation increases.
She stayed alive for about ten minutes.
She was conscious all along?
I'm sorry, Emily.
Yes.
- Don't worry.
- Well...
If she suffered all that time, I'd say between $300,000 and $500,000 for a viable verdict.
In case of brain damage to a baby, it's up to three million.
But ultimately, Lisa, your chances are low.
- Why?
It's your word against his, and you've already lied in your first statement.
A red light case is already 50-50 at the start.
What's more, with one witness and two contradictory statements?
I'd refuse the case.
It's not the money we're interested in.
I know, but...
We want this bastard to suffer and the bus company to take over his employer's responsibility.
I get it.
But no matter how we turn the thing, the fact that Lisa lied the first time is a huge handicap.
I can explain why I did it, can't I?
I'm not trying to grab money.
That's right.
She has no financial interest, she cannot be accused of bias.
To accuse him of what?
His credibility will not be questioned for financial reasons, because the jury knows that she will not be compensated.
It's better than nothing.
You think we know what that means?
That's the term.
Who are you talking to?
You know we don't know anything about it.
Looks like you're not focused.
You're not focused.
I don't know.
I'm focused.
I was thinking out loud.
All right.
All right.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry!
All right.
He wasn't always a lawyer.
He was a charming little boy.
- Anyway...
- Our goal is to...
- Hit that guy!
Make sure he can't drive a bus anymore.
Did she know she was going to die?
I'm asking because the terror of an imminent death increases the damage.
I think she was aware of that, yes.
If she had survived a few days, it would have helped us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know it's awful, but that's what it's all about.
We know that, Dave.
It's okay.
I'd just like someone to pay for what happened.
"We are for the gods of flies in the hands of mischievous children.
"They're killing us for fun."
"We are for the gods of flies in the hands of mischievous children.
"They're killing us for fun."
What does that inspire you?
Lisa?
I don't know.
You know, Lisa, that's not enough.
That's not enough.
Shakespeare wrote something.
And what's your answer?
Don't tell me you don't have an answer, I don't believe it.
I don't have much to say, it's pretty clear.
Matthew?
She's right.
He says that human beings have no more value for gods than flies for children who torture them.
We're just ants in their eyes.
Nothing more.
Darren?
Thank you, Matthew.
I agree.
Except it's not Shakespeare who says it, it's Gloucester.
Maybe another character would have another point of view.
That's a valid argument.
It is not because Shakespeare makes one of his characters say one thing that he agrees with him.
Yes, David?
Maybe Shakespeare doesn't say we're nothing to them, but there's a superior consciousness that's beyond us.
That the gods have a more developed perception of reality than ours, and that comparing theirs to ours is equivalent to comparing flies to children.
I don't think that's his point.
I believe that here it introduces a very dark vision of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
Maybe not.
He may compare human consciousness to divine consciousness, and if human suffering seems arbitrary to us, it is because our perspective is limited.
Okay, I...
I still don't agree.
If you say that they kill us for pleasure, when our perception of the gods is limited that we ignore until their intentions, is it not arrogant to think that they would take pleasure in killing us?
I don't know.
Monica?
I don't think that's what he says.
I think he means that we are nothing to the gods and that they torture us for pleasure.
But if the consciousness of the gods is so developed that they compare us to flies, how can we know with certainty what fate they reserve for us?
Okay, David, we got it.
But that doesn't make sense.
The intellectuals agree that he's talking...
- The intellectuals?
- ...of human suffering.
A thousand Frenchmen couldn't have been wrong?
I'm not saying that.
Let's move on...
Shakespeare, yes.
Because he compares human consciousness to flies and says we don't see the truth, because our consciousness is underdeveloped.
No, David, you're wrong.
That's not what he means.
He says it elsewhere, but I don't want to make a fixation. That's not what he says, point.
I wish we could move on.
"Poor Tom is cold."
Detective Mitchell.
Lisa Cohen speaking.
Lisa, what can I do for you?
I was wondering if there was anything new in the investigation.
You wanted to re-examine the driver.
We did.
All right?
So what?
Basically, he confirmed his version of the facts.
I've told my superior, and he agrees with me that we don't have anything to charge him with, so we can't do much more.
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but how did you interrogate him?
- Excuse me?
- Why should he change his version in the light of a few polite questions?
- We know he's a liar.
- In time, we would have tortured him until he told us what we wanted to hear.
But fortunately, we don't do it anymore.
Not white people.
Excuse me?
Not white people.
Anyway, I'm not saying...
- Wait a minute.
Who don't we do it to?
- Goddamn it!
I don't see what his race has to do with all this.
- There's 40,000 cops in New York...
At the risk of disappointing you, most are good guys who are trying to do their job.
All to say the D.A. won't do anything.
You can talk to the chief brigadier...
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- In that case, I'll give it to you.
The original decision was based on false information.
So why are you talking about...
So there's no way to appeal?
But how do you know Detective Mitchell put him under pressure if you weren't there?
- What's going on?
My whole family is in Colombia, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva.
I'm sure they'll eventually come back, they'll want to do something for their country.
It's a big problem.
The situation there is very precarious.
Really?
I didn't really follow.
It's chaos.
Last year, I supported the establishment of an organization for children whose families were killed or their parents kidnapped.
We're trying to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our youth, we're done.
It's the future.
Yes.
I'd like to be better informed.
Do you think Lisa would like to play theater?
No.
I don't think so.
Actually, she despises the theatre.
Maybe it's age.
Would she prefer a world without plays or movies?
Who knows?
Would you like to see a picture of my mother?
Of course.
They're all my uncles and aunts.
See?
It's a big family.
After our conversation, I called a private detective...
A what?
A private detective, to see if he could find anything on the driver.
- Really?
- Yes.
- I can't believe...
- Wait till you hear.
He called a guy who worked as a cop for MTA.
You know MTA has its own police?
MTA police.
- They have their uniforms...
- Yeah, all right.
- Wait a minute!
- Oh, my God!
What do we have to do with the MTA police and their uniforms?
Either he took a look at the guy's file.
He is involved in two other accidents less than two years apart.
What?
But he was never punished or reprimanded.
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not surprised!
If you read the papers, you'd know that MTA is swimming right now in the midst of trade union controversy.
And according to my detective, management doesn't want to make the situation worse by firing him.
It disgusts me.
I know, but that means we have something.
- Really?
- We can attack them for "maintenance by negligence."
They should have known he was a risk, but they didn't do anything, and he ended up killing someone.
- Can you prove it?
- Yes, we can force them to produce his personal file, which we know contains harmful information.
- But you won't be our lawyer.
Why not?
- That's not my specialty.
- His domain.
I'm not prepared enough.
I'd lose.
But can you advise us?
Of course.
I know a guy very well.
Russel Deutsch.
He's not a crook.
He has a lot of experience.
You must involve the cousin, she will be the beneficiary.
She won't move.
I can assure you.
If you win, she'll take between $300,000 and $500,000.
She'll move.
You're great!
The first thing to do is to file a summons against the MTA.
She has 20 days to answer, and at that time, you can ask for the coins.
Accident reports, personal records, etc.
You need to know it's going to take a while.
The law says the hearing must take place within the year.
In general, it takes six.
- Six years?
- Yeah, it depends.
As I told Dave, I have a friend of mine at the Times.
It is an eventuality that would turn the situation in our favor.
If they fear bad publicity, especially in the New York Times, they will want to compromise as quickly and discreetly as possible.
They would subordinate the agreement to our silence...
They pay, but you can't talk about it.
The terms remain secret.
What's the point?
You're taking the money.
Isn't that enough?
That's how our society punishes the wrongdoers.
By getting money from their employers' insurance?
It's called "punitive damage."
Could we predict in the agreement that they're firing the driver?
- Sure, why not?
- Is that done?
These are your conditions.
You think we're gonna win?
- Are they going to compromise?
- They're going to compromise.
Hello.
I want to talk to you.
I guess that's my newsletter?
In a thousand.
I had a friend on this street at 262.
That's nice.
You may know her,
Cheryl Rowan, a physiotherapist?
No, I don't know her.
There must be a thousand people...
What?
Nothing.
- Lisa says you're playing in a room.
That's good, you should go.
The play is very good, and served by good actors.
She's modest.
She'll win every prize in the city.
It's a long way.
I don't go much to the theater.
It's nice, because sometimes we've been doing theater for a long time, playing big roles without being recognized.
And even if we don't do it for that at first, it's nice that people notice your work.
I did a show a few years ago.
I was already living from the theater, but my whole family called me to congratulate me, and for them, I had finally succeeded.
But it was just a food-emitting beast.
That was stupid.
It wasn't that bad.
I realize it's embarrassing for Lisa, but I wanted to get to know you, because you've become very important in her life, and I don't want to be invasive, but this trial seems to have overshadowed everything else,
- That's not true.
- You're not telling me.
I want you to know that I'm very proud of your determination.
But I can't let this trial take all the place, compromise your academic achievements.
It's become a matter of homework.
Lisa has a scholarship.
I know she feels responsible for what happened.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm aware of that.
But you can't neglect school and compromise your scholarship.
That's not the case.
My grades dropped slightly.
They'll go back up.
It's not sorcerer.
Just apply a minimum.
I've been distracted, I won't be.
- All right.
- You don't have to make a conclave.
Not at all.
I wanted to know what was going on.
And meet Emily.
I know it's a little tricky.
Lisa?
Do you think Emily would like to see the play?
You could both come in, then we'd go out.
All right.
I'll ask him.
All right.
Come on, eat.
I thought I'd go live at Dad's next year.
- Yeah.
You're worried about my grades.
Santa Monica has excellent schools, and if I lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship anymore.
- Did you tell him about it?
- In a very general way.
- You want to go too?
- You want to go live in Los Angeles?
- No.
All you have to do is tell me.
Why are you reacting like that?
- How?
- You've got tears in your eyes.
Because that's what you want!
No.
If you want to go to L.A., go ahead.
Can we talk about it without you taking it badly?
It's a simple possibility!
Here's a possibility: prepare your dinner on your own.
And another one, do what you want...
What's the matter with you?
I don't care, you selfish bitch!
It makes me want to stay!
You think you're perfect?
No!
- Well done.
- Shut up!
Let me tell you something, Eliot.
How would you define your relationship?
Are you calling?
Were you visiting?
We talked twice a month, at least.
Sometimes more.
I called her, she called me.
And what were you talking about?
Mostly family.
His family, my children.
She was giving you advice?
I'd say that, yes.
Your phone records?
I got my bills.
I didn't record the calls.
No, no.
See, we used to call each other a lot.
- Great.
I see you're prepared.
- I wanted to bring everything.
During your deposition, you will repeat what you told me.
Talk about your report.
- Some advice she gave you.
Emily, how did you find this lawyer?
He was recommended to me by a friend.
Because my husband knows a very good lawyer in New York, and I don't feel very comfortable with a perfect stranger.
My friend knows him.
He says he's fine.
I don't doubt it.
But I have a share of responsibility in all this and I would feel a lot more comfortable with someone who doesn't fall from the sky.
It doesn't fall from the sky.
My friend advised me.
But Abigail, changing a lawyer wouldn't exempt you from paying for it.
You'll be compensated, so you decide.
If you all think he's good...
I don't know.
- My friend thinks so.
- All right.
Lisa, what's your role in all this?
What's your perspective?
I just wanted to...
I was there.
It's you and Monica.
Oh, my God, is that you?
It's me.
Oh, my God, is that his daughter?
Oh, my God.
How old was she when she died?
Twelve years.
I can't even imagine.
Neither do we.
You know Monica asked for her before she died?
No.
I think she was confusing.
She thought I was her daughter, just for a moment.
Then she asked me to call her to warn her.
She didn't remember that she was dead.
Then it got messed up, because I asked her her name, and she said, "Lisa." And I said, "Lisa, it's me."
I didn't realize we had the same name.
When I heard that her daughter had died, since then, I had the weird feeling that during the last five minutes, I was her daughter.
As if, somehow, this wonderful woman had been able to see her daughter a few minutes before she died.
Does she still live in your body?
Or did she come back to the spirit world after the accident?
I'm not saying she lived in my body.
I don't believe this stuff.
I don't care what you believe.
Why are you mad at me?
Because it's not an opera!
- What?
- It's not an opera!
You think it's for me?
- Because I think it's dramatic?
You're very young.
So what?
It means things reach me more because they never happened to me.
No, it means they get to you easier.
It's very different.
But it doesn't happen to you.
I wasn't the one who was hit, but...
Exactly.
It's not you who died of leukemia or an earthquake in Algeria!
But it'll happen to you someday.
Do you understand?
It'll happen to you.
- And it's not dramatic.
- I know it!
Your infantile and fake depth is wind.
- You understand?
Wind!
In two months, nothing will be left!
When you grow up and you don't make a drama of every crushed dog anymore, that's where we'll see who you are!
I didn't want to talk about it and I don't play those little games.
- Neither do I!
- Don't look so outraged!
You're free to falsify your life, but not that of others.
That's what the Nazis do!
I find it slightly suspicious, all that hay for someone you didn't know, you don't even get along with your mother.
I'm dreaming!
But it's my life, it's my friend who got killed, the one I haven't seen since I was 19.
I refuse to allow her to be manipulated by an emotionally ill teenage girl.
I'm not manipulating anything!
I was there, and not you, and if I ever express myself in a dramatic way, it's because it's my language!
I can't help it if my mother's an actress!
Why are you so vehement?
- "Véhémente"?
All right.
You better get out of here.
Because I said "vehement"?
Yes.
Go away.
All right.
- Now!
- I'll take my bag!
By saying "vehement," I meant "vigourous."
I didn't choose my word.
- You'll check your house.
- You're amazing.
- That's right.
- Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything.
I'm a human being.
Monica was a human being.
Just like his daughter and your mother.
We're not second roles in the fascinating history of your life.
I never thought so and I didn't want to disrespect you.
I didn't mean to insult you.
Really.
I feel bad about what happened and I'm desperately trying to do something.
I don't understand why, if I say something stupid, you have to condemn me.
Thanks for letting me come.
I know it bothers you.
It's okay.
I had no one to talk to.
You've always been understanding me, and even if I don't always express it, I really appreciate it.
I'm happy to do it.
Well...
What's going on?
I need to talk to someone who understands a little about who I am.
Not even who I am, but what I think, what I live.
- It's confused, isn't it?
- No.
Anyway, I don't know why, but I always felt like we understood each other.
Although I am this pile of contradictory impulses, and you, the wisest and most rational man I know.
I don't think that's true, but thank you.
It's hot.
A little hot.
- May I?
- Of course.
Can we smoke at your place?
You can smoke.
- I like your place.
- Thank you.
I'm subletting.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
It's awful.
What?
What's awful?
I like you very much.
- I'm sorry.
What an idiot!
- Lisa, Lisa.
I'm your friend.
And I will.
It won't change.
Thank you.
I really like you.
What's Indiana like?
That's good.
Please don't do this.
I didn't plan on that.
I don't know how to react.
Don't worry.
I won't say anything if you're worried.
I'm the one who forced your hand.
It's just sex.
Don't be a child.
I'll see you in class.
What a jerk!
I think teenagers should lead the world, because life hasn't corrupted them yet, they have ideals, they invest themselves.
Many people think they are naive, and many are.
But they have not yet been embroiled by disillusionment and the harsh reality of compromises.
So I'd vote "yes."
Good.
Lisa?
I won't comment on the fact that you compared a 19-year-old Palestinian to Hitler Youth!
They both like to kill Jews!
- Lisa!
Hey!
- Stop.
Because they've been busy, humiliated and bombed for 50 years!
And because they like it.
Not kill civilians as a last resort.
It's their first recourse, it's easy, they like it.
- Raise your hand.
- They like it?
They're just bad?
There are.
They took their foot on September 11th.
They're killing their raped sisters!
- It's barbaric!
- Who?
They're just killing each other.
They're doing this for fun!
You're not alone!
You're not even Jewish!
The next one who talks without raising his hand...
I'm not violent, not pro-Israel.
Lisa!
Get out!
Perfect.
Thank you.
I've lost my temper, but there are some things...
Who's leading these debates?
Lisa, remember, it's easy for the dominant party to settle for the status quo.
What do you mean by that?
The oppressor uses violence to establish his positions under the cover of the law.
But when the oppressed uses violence to change their status, they call them criminal or terrorist.
And we're calling on the law to arrest him.
I see.
And what would you like them to do?
"They" who?
Jewish oppressors.
What should they do?
I didn't use that expression.
- No.
- But since you're asking...
I spent the day discussing it, I didn't want to do it again.
- Don't order me.
- I'm not ordering you.
- Did you like the play?
- Forget it.
I find it ironic that the victims of the Nazis use... if they were Nazis,
- There'd be no more Arabs.
- ...their...
- That's what I'm saying!
- I'm leaving.
Come on, Emily, stay.
That's the Jewish reaction.
Excuse me?
Jewish reaction.
You don't like what I say or do, so...
- Oh, my God!
- That's my Jewish reaction.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It perfectly sums up what I was saying.
That's the Jewish reaction.
Joan, I don't have to justify myself.
I just wanted to say that it is the typical reaction of people who defend their position.
If I had said "Israeli" instead of "Jewish," she wouldn't have said anything.
But if you want to break up with me because I used the wrong adjective...
What should I do?
I'm not begging you.
Hello?
Hey, Dad, are you okay?
Really?
What's the matter?
I never said that.
Nobody tells me what he wants to eat.
Annette called you four times, and you never called back.
Apparently, the ranch hospices her to choose five menus for a trip that we won't make in a month and a half.
I don't have any more success with Curtis.
What's the point?
I think he's looking forward to it.
I didn't get that impression.
And, Lisa, I think we should revisit your idea of coming here next year.
Looks like I'm gonna be very busy in the fall, so I won't be home a lot.
You and Annette hate each other, I don't want to take this after a 2:00 p.m. day.
We don't hate each other.
I'm telling you, you don't make me feel like I'm saying this seriously.
All right.
Tell Curtis that New Mexico is falling into the water, and we'll remember.
- All right.
- Good.
What's wrong?
- Mr. Deutsch?
- I'm listening.
I was thinking if they're in such a hurry to compromise, maybe we should wait a little longer, show them their teeth?
Maybe we're making a mistake.
They're reacting to the article.
It's common sense.
Understand that they offer to compromise because they want to avoid scandal.
That's why Russel thinks...
The goal is not to get more.
Excuse me?
- We didn't hear.
- Ladies, let me...
Rob.
Abigail.
Let me finish.
They bit the hook.
But if we let it go for six months, the effect may fall back.
Do you understand?
I guarantee you I'll hit them hard.
That's why I brought all of us together, to talk about other, non-material conditions.
I promise I'll be very aggressive.
What other conditions?
What are you thinking, some kind of foundation?
- A what?
- A foundation for children?
I don't understand.
"Non-material"?
You mean a trust fund?
A foundation for children at their expense?
For taxes?
- What foundation, for Christ's sake?
- Are they stupid or what?
Because know we've been through this nightmare with Monica and our kids, and it wasn't a pleasure.
We want a clear solution...
Damage is perfect.
- Lisa, I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Now what?
They have to decide the conditions.
Hello?
Yes?
- What do you mean?
- What's the matter?
Yes?
Yes.
- Ramon had a stroke.
- He'll be all right?
- Shut up!
Yes?
All right.
I'll take a note.
I'm not saying that to make humor: isn't this a Jewish funeral home?
They do both, I think.
Excuse me.
- Joan?
You must be Rodrigo?
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Rodrigo, this is...
- I wanted to tell you that Dad kept talking about you.
- Really?
- Yes.
Thanks for telling me.
- Maybe this isn't the time...
- Please.
But...
He was going out a lot.
The last time I talked to him, he told me that as soon as he met you,
He knew he wanted to marry you.
Because for the first time since my mother died, he had met someone with whom he was really complicit.
Well, he was...
- Excuse me...
Thanks for coming with me.
It was my pleasure.
You're welcome.
I don't want to be macabre, but...
Ramon and I had to go to Hoffman's Tales next week, and I still have the tickets.
You're interested?
Or should I give them?
It's Monday night.
We could make ourselves beautiful.
All right.
What do you think?
That people don't get in touch.
They're disconnected.
That's what I think.
Well...
It's too bad you think that, 'cause I feel like we've been complicit before.
I wasn't saying that to hurt you.
I used to say that.
All right.
Are you hugging me?
Of course.
I feel completely lost.
Hello, Emily.
Hello, Lisa.
- Hello.
Hello.
I'm pleased to inform you that I've had a long meeting with the bus company's lawyer and they're offering $350,000.
- What?
Wonderful!
- That's great!
I guess it's all right for everyone.
- That's great!
I have to present the offer to you and get your official agreement.
- Mr. Deutsch?
- That being the case, I know someone was afraid we'd give up too fast.
- Perfect.
- We just want to...
Abigail.
Rob.
Could we listen to what Russel has to say and talk about it when he tells us the whole story and gives his recommendations?
Yes.
Sorry about that.
Go on.
I was saying someone was afraid we'd go too fast.
Don't worry.
- You're gonna let him talk?
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I think this is a very honest offer.
They can't wait to close.
But I also believe that, at this moment, they are under the greatest possible pressure, and I believe that nothing better will be achieved.
$350,000 is already a lot of money.
I just mean...
- Can you all hear me?
Was that everyone?
Okay.
Emily, what do you think?
I think we should accept.
- But I'd like to...
- All right, then.
Do you think we'd be better off shooting in length?
That would be a mistake.
Robbie, what do you think?
- Adjudged!
- Adjudged!
All right.
The only drawback of the agreement, and I know that it is not indifferent to you, is that they categorically refuse to consider the dismissal of the driver.
- What do you mean?
- The driver?
- It's out of the question.
They won't fire him?
- Let me finish.
- You can only hear a big hustle and bustle.
- Let him finish.
- It's out of the question!
Thank you.
Lisa, I assure you that I insisted heavily, but they refuse to negotiate disciplinary action as a condition of the agreement, because it would amount to a partial admission of guilt.
And give us $300,000?
Negotiating an agreement does not mean admitting fault.
It doesn't have the same weight.
What's more, you may not know that they're facing a big trade union controversy.
Tell them it's no.
- That's your opinion.
- That's why we're here.
- Can I step in?
- It's not up to you to decide.
- It's Emily's.
- Can you hear us?
- No.
- They're not listening.
- Oh, right?
- No!
- It's up to Abigail to decide, as the closest relative.
She didn't know!
Whatever.
Could we just say a word?
I'm sorry.
There's a lot of conflicting emotions.
Emily?
Rob and I think it's better to beat the iron while it's hot.
If they refuse to fire him, they'll never do it.
- And in six months, a year...
- Exactly.
We might be begging them to give us half.
The purpose of the trial was to get him fired so he wouldn't do it again.
Don't take $350,000 out of the sky for someone you don't even like!
If you get that money, it's only thanks to me!
I'm sorry for the rudeness, but you should want to give up the money to put it out of order!
- To punish him!
I have a responsibility for Monica and I take her very seriously.
Instead of being insulted for being kind enough to include you in these discussions, Lisa, I was hoping you'd respect our advice.
- Am I wrong?
- It doesn't matter.
What's your interest in all this?
I killed her!
I killed her, but I know that.
This guy doesn't realize it.
He lives his life quietly by accusing others.
I want someone to make him understand what he did!
If they don't let him go, if there's only the money you're interested in, the police don't do anything, how will he know?
You can't accept it!
The purpose was not to compensate you, but to get him fired!
I don't know about you, but where I come from, $350,000, that's a hell of a lot of money, and I think it's a better result than getting someone fired for a mistake, even if it's serious.
Fuck you!
Lisa!
Lawyer for both of me!
And you, the moralist bitch!
From now on, I'm applying zero tolerance.
Good.
At least I'm not the only one.
Hey!
Lisa, what's going on?
You know I had an abortion last week?
No.
I didn't know.
Yeah, it cost me $400.
You want me to...
- No, stay.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You want to tell us about it?
Yes.
All right.
Go on.
Well...
Did you tell your parents?
Yes.
And you told the father?
No.
I'm not sure who he is.
You should tell them anyway.
No.
Whatever.
I'm sure he's sorry, whoever he is.
The fact that he's sorry doesn't change the problem.
It doesn't make any difference.
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have talked about it.
Don't say anything.
I promise.
But you have to tell the potential fathers.
It's okay, I...
I have to go.
I don't care what the father did, anyway, it was my fault.
I'm so sorry.
What happened to him?
- Mom's looking for you.
- Why?
She says you're going out tonight.
Where?
I don't know.
Don't get crushed.
- Wait.
- What?
I want to see if it's him.
It's him, Mom.
That's him.
Hey.
So far, I can't say I'm excited.
That's very good.
