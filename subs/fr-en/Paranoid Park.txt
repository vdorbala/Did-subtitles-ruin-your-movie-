Oh, hi, Tommy.
Hello.
In the last week of summer, we were in the city centre.
It was a nice day. I was with Jared. He was a little older than me.
He wanted us to go for a ride to Paranoid Park.
I've heard about this place before, of course.
But I never thought I'd go...
It wasn't meant for me.
But when I said, "I don't think I'm ready..."
...Jared laughed and said something like:
"No one's ever ready for Paranoid Park..."
We were both there the following week.
There's a lot of people here. We should go on Saturday.
And then a month later, in the middle of math class, my name was announced on the microphone.
My name.
And not another one.
Okay, today, I'd like to talk to you about gravity, so... gravity is the force that's exerted on an object when...
Um, but... what's funny is that the objects, they want... uh...
Alex Dremain is requested to attend the Main Office.
Alex Dremain at the main office.
We have objects like this, you know, that are... divided in the middle...
But an object can also... oh!
Okay, sorry...
Hey, Alex.
Sit down.
Hello.
Sorry to make you miss the class.
Oh, it's okay.
All right.
So... I talked to your friend Jared.
He told me you were together at the skateboard park on the night of the 17th, right?
Yes.
Okay, did you walk around that night?
What do I have?
Were you around that night?
Um... yeah.
Okay.
So you were there.
In the park.
No.
Where have you been?
I went to the center to find something to eat. I parked not far from the sea, and then I walked.
Okay.
Or did you skate?
Yes.
Uh, no, I had my skate, but... I'm not very good, so I'm trying to train myself.
Okay.
And you could tell me what time it was, all this, I mean, roughly?
Yes.
I went to Jared's about seven o'clock... and then dropped him off by a bus station a little later.
And then I ran away.
Oh, yeah, it's complicated because...
I didn't go home, I first went to Jared's because...
We were planning to spend the night at his house at first.
Okay, okay.
And where were his parents?
His mother was... in Las Vegas...
And his father doesn't live with them.
Okay, so no brothers and sisters, the house was completely empty, then?
Yes.
Did your parents know that?
I mean...
That there was no one else at Jared's?
Uh, they're not the kind to worry about that kind of thing...
Okay...
I mean, no... it's okay...
See, it's really that old technique or you tell your parents you're going to a boyfriend's house they don't realize there's nobody at his house and finally you can do everything and anything.
It's true, but...
For my parents there's no problem.
No, it's okay, I had to say it.
It's really the old thing.
Yeah.
What's your parenting situation?
What do you mean?
Yes, your parents...
Are they... are they still together?
They've been separated for a while... and they're going to divorce soon.
Ah, okay.
Okay, my parents got divorced, too.
That's the kind of problem we have at your age.
I know these things can...
I mean... yes.
Uh...
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Yes, a little brother, and he's thirteen.
Okay, and no sister?
No.
Uh... a girlfriend?
Yes.
Jennifer.
Jennifer?
Where was she last night?
- My girlfriend?
- Yes, yes.
She was with... some friends...
Okay.
You called him that night, remember the time?
I mean, do you have a GSM?
No, I didn't call her, and I don't have a GSM.
Okay.
Uh...
I'm going through my notes...
I'll tell you what...
Uh... what I've got right now.
There's a guard... we found him dead, cut in half.
So we thought maybe he slipped...
But the autopsy showed that he was hit by an object.
So... wondering if... that wouldn't be the object we found in the river nearby.
It's a skateboard, actually.
And what's funny is that the DNA found on the skateboard... puts him directly in touch with the crime.
So, where were you?
I... I went to downtown to eat something at the Subway.
Okay, but there must be a thousand or two thousand Subways in town.
- What have you been to?
- The one by the coast.
Okay, this one... on the World Trade Center site, this one?
Yes.
Okay, what did you take?
Ham, salad, grilled bread... tomatoes, mustard, olive oil,...
Mayo?
No.
You have to take mayo with this.
The mayo sucks.
The mayo sucks.
And what kind of bread was that?
Italian and cheese.
Okay, did you get that, somewhere in your pockets?
No, I'll take some... I'll never take any at the Subway.
So how much did it cost you?
It was supposed to be... six bucks, it's expensive at Subways.
Half a loaf?
One-third.
A third, for six tickets, did you have to take the menu, then?
No, just a drink.
Okay, okay.
Large, Dr. Pepper.
Did anyone come with you?
I was all alone.
I have the license, so...
Okay...
I'm not gonna hold you any longer.
I'll give you my card.
If anything comes back to you...
I want you to call me, okay?
- Okay.
- You'll do it?
Can I go back to class?
Of course.
Thank you very much.
I'm writing all this.
I'm sorry, I'm not doing this very well, I'm not very... creative.
But...
I put everything on paper, if ever.
What are you writing?
Oh nothing, just homework.
Good day for that.
Well, after Jared talked about the park the first time, we decided to go there the next day.
It wasn't the night the police inspector was talking about.
But for the first time, I loved it.
What I liked about Paranoid was the people who used to hang out with him.
They had built the place themselves, without a permit.
skaters, squatters, drunks, drug addicts, punks, abandoned kids...
My life didn't matter.
This place is drunk.
We should go on Saturday.
It could be nice.
But by Saturday there was a problem. Jennifer... my girlfriend.
Yeah, but you see, all this is you, instead of seeing me you'd rather hang out with him, and that's why I'm upset.
And she wanted me to hang out with her that night.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
You can't...
No, you can't do that.
You can't call my friends, it's... like... no!
Jennifer was nice, and all that, but... she was a virgin.
Which means somehow... she didn't want to do it.
And so I knew things were going to get serious.
I told my mom I was going to spend the Saturday night at Jared's and we could go to the show earlier, or Sunday.
Then I asked to take his car.
And respect the road code, little guy!
Yes, yes.
All right.
Hello, welcome to Burger-ville.
Order when you're ready.
Uh...
I'd like two cheeseburgers, and... a chocolate milkshake.
Alex, I know it bothers you and everything, but this trip to Corvalis is really important to me.
Come on, you're not gonna miss Paranoid for a girl.
Especially when she ignored you all the holidays.
Yeah, but you know...
This time I'm going to sleep with her.
Besides, you should call Jennifer, right, what are you waiting for with her?
What do you want?
What I wanted was to skate with the hardcore guys from Paranoid Park.
It works, man, you can pee in my house.
Watch the TV!
Call Jennifer!
And we'll both have sex!
I didn't want anyone to ruin my mother's car, so I parked it across the river that seemed safer to me.
Hey, kid!
Hello.
Does your mom know you're here?
Yes.
Is she hot?
Dude, I don't know.
You should bring it to us.
Paranoid, that was great.
I could have been sitting all night watching skaters, and girls, and all the stuff that happened.
The only thing is, I started thinking about my parents.
Hello?
My father was supposed to have moved.
But he kept calling us.
And my mother didn't care too much about it.
And my poor brother Henry, who was 13, would throw up his dinner so much he cares about all this.
He can't hold on to the stress.
I've been thinking about Jennifer, too.
She seemed to really care about both of us, but I didn't feel it too much.
I wish I'd loved her more, or we'd go more things in common.
Hey, kid!
You know skateboarding does something other than a couch?
I'm waiting for someone.
Wow!
What's the matter with you?
Are you going to roll or not?
I'm waiting for someone.
You wouldn't let me use it?
I'm waiting for someone.
You know there's dead people buried here?
Right?
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, tell us what you got.
Let me have your skate, and if I don't come back, you can have the little hottie right here.
- All right.
- Isn't she cute?
Hello.
My name is Paisley, and he's Jolt.
Hey, look at him!
Great, thanks, man.
I told you I'd come back.
No problem.
So, where do you live?
Right here, man.
At the skate park?
- Right.
- This is our damn house!
What about you?
My mother's.
You want to take a train ride?
Empty a few beers?
All right.
What about you guys?
We're staying here, man.
He asked me if I wanted beer.
I didn't know much about beer, but I really wanted to climb a freight train.
And then, later that night, I went back to Jared's.
I had to change clothes, my clothes were really dirty.
What cities, please?
Yes, Tremain, in Gearhart, please.
Press 'one' to be connected at no extra cost.
Happy Citizenship Day.
So, how's it going with your parents?
Not very good.
It's official now, they're breaking up.
Must be hard.
Yeah, well... that's how it is.
I, uh... heard about you and Jennifer.
Well, you know, everybody knows about you and Jennifer, so...
Yes...
It didn't last long.
No, not really.
So... when did you leave her?
Why I went out with her, you mean.
Yeah, that's what I mean, you didn't like him?
Well, I was a little in love with her this summer, before she decided I was her boyfriend.
With all the stuff that's happening to you right now,
It must be really hard.
I mean.
What?
Macy... you know...
Everyone's parents divorce.
There are other problems...
More important.
Like...?
Like...
People dying in Iraq, famine in Africa...
How long have you been worried about Africa?
Yeah, but... you know what I mean...
Little problems... it's just a little stupid.
Not if it happens to you.
Yeah, well... stuff in general.
So... does it look like something happened to you?
No, you know what I mean, Macy.
Not really.
Did something happen to you?
No...
I just feel like something's going on beyond normal life.
Beyond the teachers, the students, you know...
Like... somewhere else.
As if... there were... different levels of events.
And... something happened to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Alex...
Alex...
You were gonna cross the hall and ignore me?
Did you have fun with Jared on Saturday?
Not really.
What did you do?
Just hang out.
Well, I was swimming at Elisabeth's.
You should have come.
But, that's right, I guess you're not interested, it's more fun to skate with Jared.
But...
I don't care. Shut up.
So... what are you doing after school?
Nothing.
Can we do something if you want?
Okay.
Cool.
Will you come with me to class?
Okay.
Get out.
Don't laugh!
The pants are a little too big.
Oh, this is crazy.
I think you've never been so sexy, Alex!
I need a smaller pair of pants.
But it's good if you don't?
It's, uh... it's interesting.
You should try too!
Okay... change...
Change now!
Oh, shit!
Is it comfortable?
No, it's really big.
Look, the straps hang!
Sounds good to me.
It's the same, huge.
Do you want to?
Take this.
Take your shirt.
Give me...
I need my clothes!
Give them to me!
I need my clothes!
Can you give them back to me, please?
Get out!
You can't be here!
I... get out!
Dude, it's not your board.
No, I just got it.
Why would you need a new board?
I wanted to try something different.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why would I tell you? It's just a new board!
'Cause I'm gonna do it with you and I don't want to be followed by a flashboard.
Wow, it's not a crappy board, come on, drive.
Okay...
Mm mm.
I got the Boogie Buns.
Is that... is that techno?
Dude, we should go for a ride to Paranoid Park.
I don't think I'm ready for Paranoid Park.
Yeah, but nobody's ever ready for Paranoid Park.
This is News Break, I'm Ken Boddie.
Was it an accident or a horrible murder?
The police are currently on a morbid scene near the main garage area,
A guard was found dead, literally cut in half by a freight train.
According to the police, this is a homicide, but she doesn't want to say any more yet.
No suspects have been found yet.
Our journalists are on the case, you'll find out more tonight at 11 am on KOIN news 6.
I woke up by the vending machines, remembering nothing.
Did you drink?
Yeah.
And I forgot everything.
I thought your great plan could only work...
Hey, do you know why he's getting boarded?
Oh, yeah.
He must've been getting smoked, or something...
I mean, I don't know.
I don't think he'll get a fair trial.
That's my food, man.
I've got the slab.
The following persons are requested to visit the principal's office.
Jared Fitch, Christian Barlow, Paul and Alex Tremain.
Didn't he just say my name?
Yes.
Hey, they want to see all the skaters in school, man.
Okay, this is Detective Lu.
Hello...
Hey... 'day, Loulou.
Hello.
Is that why?
The handcuffs?
Oh, a little respect, please.
A little respect.
Respect my...
So...
Thanks, uh...
Miss Adams.
Shit!
Look at me...
What are you looking at?
So...
Like she said, my name is Detective Lu.
You can call me Rich.
Or Loulou.
As you know, my colleague and I are here for the murder that took place in the south...
Near a skate park.
And the police want us to meet and make contact with...
The skater community.
And we hope you can help us solve this case.
Anyway... what I want is...
Talk to you and get to know you.
Let's go, so we're gonna go around the classroom...
I want to know you all.
You're going to introduce yourself...
We'll start here.
- I'm Paul Thrief.
- Paul, Jérémy.
Eric.
- Christian.
- Christian.
- Cal.
- Cal.
Alex.
- Jared.
- Jared.
Jérémy.
Brian.
Okay.
Raise your finger if you've ever been... to the East skate park.
You know everyone here is going to lift their finger.
But we don't call him that, we say Paranoid Park.
Paranoid.
Okay, everybody's been there.
Okay, well, that's what I was hoping for.
And who of you was there, anytime, on the weekend of September 16-17?
Okay, uh...
Jared.
Yeah, yeah, uh...
Alex and I were there, I think... that week... during the day.
This week.
Do you remember the day it was?
Uh, I don't know...
Maybe Tuesday?
Okay.
Actually, we wanted to go this weekend, but we didn't.
No?
Why not?
I was in Oregon.
Okay, Corvalis.
It's okay.
So... you were in Oregon, and you were in Paranoid Park?
No.
Neither.
Where were you then?
I...
I didn't want to go there alone, so...
I...
Yeah, no one dares to go to Paranoid alone.
This place is creepy.
- I go there all the time.
- Yeah, right.
They only fuck you if you piss them off.
I go there all the time.
Shit, we don't care.
I'm just talking about reputation.
Okay, I'm fine.
I get it.
We're gonna...
We're gonna get out of this.
Hey, what are you actually blaming us for?
No, I'm not accusing you of anything, really nothing.
There's no suspect here.
Actually, to make it clear, no one in this room is suspicious.
If you were really suspicious, we were treating you differently than now, okay?
What I'm trying to do is learn a little more, get a better idea about it... skater community.
It's not like a community.
It's not like we know each other.
Yeah, I get it.
Actually...
Let me give you a little idea of what we have.
What we have is... a possible murder.
Will you hold this for me?
Take a look at the pictures, you'll understand why we're here.
Oh, man, let me see.
Oh, shit!
Gentlemen, here's the picture.
Looks like a piece of his clothes stayed on the track...
The two pieces were found on the tracks, right next to the main garage area, in the south of the city.
And the train that was... involved in what you see passed right before the garage area, through... the east skate park.
- Is...
- And?
Is?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
They say Paranoid Park here, man.
Yes... there you go.
And... you know what?
We think it's possible, if it's a murder, someone from...
Paranoid park...
It's got to be involved.
So you think a skateboarder did this?
Look...
I tried to erase that moment from my head...
But everything came back to me with Lu's photo.
It was my chance to stop, to think about it for a second, think about the best thing to do.
Wow!
You're good at it, aren't you?
Next time you sneak a train, set it up...
It's safer.
If you drop and flip, you'll fall on the side without too much breakage.
Because if you get here and fall... you go under.
Wow!
You like it, man, is it the foot?
Oh fucking!
Quick, quick, quick, hide!
He was trying to kill us.
He had a truncheon.
Why... why can't you understand that...
Shit... come on...
Call the police.
It's okay, Alex, you won't have any problems.
Call home...
Or someone...
It was self-defense.
I thought about my skateboarding...
Everyone defends themselves...
But I never thought...
'I had to tell someone.
Maybe that was what he...
It's okay, Alex.
You won't have any problems.
It's okay.
Find a lawyer and then...
The police.
That's what real people do.
Calm down, Alex.
It's all right.
My brain could argue all night... my body didn't care.
He wanted one thing: get the hell out of here.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I was so scared...
What were you doing?
It was not a waste of time.
I had to call someone.
Do something and rip it off my head.
Father, I had to talk to him.
I knew where he was, at my Uncle Tomy's.
I could already see the conversation.
Name, and city, please.
Yes, Tremain in Gearhart, please.
Press 'one' to be connected at no additional cost.
Have a good day of citizenship.
Hey, honey, what are you doing so early?
We didn't go to the show, Jared was sick.
Because of what?
'Don't know.
Chou?
Hey, honey?
What?
Uh, Uncle Tomy called.
He said he got a call when he was on the beach...
Really?
Yeah, he said the call came from the Fitch's... he asked me if I...
I knew someone by that name, and I told him that was where you were staying.
Oh.
Did you call Uncle Tomy?
Yeah, maybe by accident.
He said it was at 4:35 in the morning...
That's weird.
Were you still up?
N...
No, but... then I tried to call Ryan, but...
Maybe I was sleepwalking, or...
Oh.
Yes.
I really don't know.
Okay.
I'm gonna go see what they have as snowboards... since I haven't been to the show.
Oh, okay.
No problem, you know.
Uh, but, where's your skateboard?
Oh, I left it at Jared's.
Okay.
Hey, how are you?
Good.
What can I get you?
Uh, I'll just have a glass of water, is that possible?
Yes, I'll leave the menu for you if you ever...
Thanks, okay.
Hey!
What are you doing here at this hour?
Nothing.
Really?
And you're reading the paper now?
Yeah, I'm reading the paper...
Oh.
Is there anything about the war?
Nope.
I was just watching sports.
On the subway?
Come on...
On the subway?
Come on...
Hey, Rachel.
Hey, Alex.
So, uh... did you come to read the paper?
I was bored, so that's...
I was just wondering.
We're going to see a movie at the movies.
You want to come?
No, thanks, I'm here.
Glander, sitting here... reading your paper?
Yeah, especially sports.
Okay, well...
I think we'll see each other again after...
Okay.
Well...
Hey, then!
Hello.
She's a good one.
Thank you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
- What...?
- You put on glasses...
It doesn't make sense.
I don't know, you...
Bring them here as if...
Where's the problem you've seen yourself?
Yeah, how could you...
But it's dark, you don't have to see anything...
I don't know, Gabe told me to put them on...
It's a joke...
I mean, Alex...
Alex.
Alex...
Awkward...
- Awkward.
- Looks like Alex.
It's... it's just...
You think we should do it again?
Or... maybe we should wait.
We're gonna need more condoms.
We should go to Rite Aid's and get some.
That's where...
Pauline and George have their own.
Yeah, we did.
Oh, yes, I know...
No, that was great.
Okay, okay, I got to go.
It's okay.
You think Lu knows more about this than we do?
Like what?
I don't know, like... he was trying to trap us or something...
Detectives do that.
No, man, you're paranoid.
We don't have to worry.
I mean, he doesn't know anything.
He's just pretending to handle it.
Yeah, but he was weird.
The detective comes to school and just talks to skateboarders?
Yeah...
Dude, cops are like this.
Why do you think they'd be cops?
They earn less than a janitor.
Yeah, but I think they're doing this for other reasons.
Like what?
Adults only work for the money.
And nothing else.
Cops are also shitty.
It's for the money.
Hello, darling.
Hello.
Do you have condoms?
Nope.
You want us to take some... after school?
If you want.
Is there a problem?
What's wrong?
No.
I mean, you're really weird sometimes, you should be a little more happy to see me after what we did.
It was your idea.
What?
What does that mean?
Nothing.
So the sex was me.
Not your fault.
You were just passing by.
No, I'm just saying...
You were the first to have condoms, so...
We should have taken them together.
Oh.
Okay, sorry.
I thought you were talking about something else.
No, it's just that.
Okay, we'll do that.
Hey, Alex.
Hey, 'pa.
Shit, or is what I did to him.
You're gonna buy it?
Just borrow it.
Your Uncle Tomy and I are going to the lake this weekend.
Do you need this?
Yes, thank you.
Look, I wanted to talk to you...
I don't know...
What you heard or... what your mother told you.
But... I'm probably not coming back here for a long time.
Uh, we're thinking about the rides, the stuff, you know, we're trying to see what's best for you and Henry.
Working with your mother isn't...
The easiest thing... as I think you know.
But if there's anything special... think about it and tell me.
How's school?
Not bad.
How's Parker and the gang?
They're fine.
I saw Parker's father at Outdoors World.
Yes?
Yes...
You still skate?
Yeah, a little.
Great.
Yeah, you know, I should...
I've finished my homework, so...
Look, I...
I just want you to know that...
I feel bad about all this...
I was years away from wanting this to happen...
If there's anything I can do to make this less difficult, please tell me.
I understand how you feel, 'pa.
Jennifer!
Jennifer.
I can't believe it.
You think after sex, can you break up with me?
It was free sex, man!
She was always hot!
Yeah, man, I hope you got a spare wheel...
Shit, I was sick of her and her friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Completely crazy.
I didn't like her either.
But fucking is always better than not fucking.
Yeah, man.
Right.
How are you?
Good.
Do you have caramel cappuccinos?
No, we don't have caramel cappuccinos.
Shit.
Do you have any...?
There's only... there's only Starbucks.
Robin, can you give me a slice?
Mm-hmm.
It looks really good.
Hello!
I need coffee.
Again.
Tell me about it in detail.
Coffee.
See... see, Tina...
The llama?
I think so.
"Tina, my fat, come and eat!"
And you remember the one at school, right now with the toothpaste?
It looks like, with the teacher, it looks like...
"Can I use the phone?"
"Why"
"I don't feel well!"
So, he's on the phone...
It's his... fret Kip, too stupid...
He says, he says, he says, uh, "I... is Grandma here?"
He says, "No Napoleon..." "I can...
Where is she?"
"To the beach."
"Since when does Grandma go to the beach?"
"I don't know, she's with her boyfriend."
He says, "What?" and then he says...
"You can at least bring me my toothpaste!"
And he says, "No, Napoleon."
He says, "What?" And then he says,
"Come on, just bring it from the nurse, she's got two hundred in her drawers."
And he says,
"Oh, I'm not gonna use the nurse's toothpaste, you're crazy!"
And then he hangs up, and then...
We shouldn't get involved anymore.
What are you talking about?
- War...
Iraq...
- No.
Oh.
Why?
I don't care.
Geez... that's the kind of thing that doesn't go to people today.
Apathy.
What?
Oh, forget it.
I don't know much about war.
Find out, man.
Read the papers.
I hate... reading the war papers.
Okay, I'll never...
What's the matter with you?
Bad...
What the hell are you doing spreading on the road?
That's because...
Are you enjoying yourself on the floor?
You've got to shoot me.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
What's on your face?
Go on!
Pedal.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I have the answer.
To what?
Well, when you said that...
If something happened to you, and you couldn't tell anyone...
It's okay, forget it.
You know, what I would have done...
It's writing a letter.
To whom?
The person you did it to.
Like, an apology, or something.
Or... to someone else, who has nothing to do with this.
Anyway, the goal is to get this out of your consciousness.
And then only you can undress.
And what do I have to do with the letter... after?
We don't care, you can burn it, post it, hide it, you know?
The important thing is writing.
So...
Yeah, when you get all this out, you'll feel better.
I'm relieved.
I don't know, Macy. I'd feel like I'm doing a job.
Trust me, it's not a duty at all.
You know...
It's really better when you get rid of it.
Yeah... maybe.
The thing is to write it to someone you can really talk to, who you feel good about.
Not your parents, your teachers, or that kind of guy.
Write it for a friend.
Yes.
Write to me.
Okay, Macy.
It's late, I have to go.
We're gonna take a class in the study room, and that's gonna talk about microinvertebrates.
We'll see tolerant groups, and... intolerant groups...
And put water in the pond.
And classify...
micro-invertebrates.
Alex?
