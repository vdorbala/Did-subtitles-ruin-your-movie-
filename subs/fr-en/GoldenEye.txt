I'm sorry.
I forgot to knock.
Where are the others?
Our tragedy to all of us.
Late, 007.
A pressing need.
Saviour, once again?
After you, 006.
James... for England.
For England, Alec.
It's too easy.
In all, luck decides for half.
Who decides the other one?
The Destiny.
Trigger: 6 minutes.
Fire!
The pub closes, James!
Last drink!
Pay me a pint!
This is Colonel Ourumov.
Get out, hands up!
How original!
Close the door, Alec!
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
Move forward.
Drop your gun, and come to me... slowly.
Finish the job!
Pulverize them!
You have ten seconds.
Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two...
For England!
Stop the fire!
The gas is going to explode!
This is your last chance.
Get your hands out of...
Wait!
You won't win.
Over there!
Hurry!
Move!
Stop the fire!
Wait!
James, is it necessary to go to this hell train?
More than you think.
Like any woman, a trip makes my conquest...
- Who is it?
- My future conquest.
James, stop!
Stop!
- I see your little game.
- Really?
But again?
You want to dazzle me by the size of your...
- Engine?
- Ego.
Instead of enjoying this ride, you play shrinks.
I'm here to evaluate you.
To hell with all this.
Honor to the ladies.
Stop that car!
All right?
Se-ance-te-nante!
See, I bend to female despotism.
You're incorrigible!
What am I gonna do with you?
Let's get to your assessment, right?
And let it be very... searched.
Ma'am wins.
Make your bets.
- Anyone?
- Banco.
It seems that we shared the same passions.
Three, at least.
I see two of them:
Cylinders, and... baccara.
Seven.
Ma'am wins.
The third should reveal your hidden talents.
This challenge moves me.
Madam keeper on the 5th.
Six.
Miss loses.
Enjoy it... while it lasts.
Word for word my motto.
And you, what's your motto?
Know how to retire in beauty.
I never learned that.
Will you show me?
Vodka-Martini.
To the shaker, not to spoon it.
What about you?
Same thing.
Do you have a desire?
Without chichis... but a little full-bodied.
Thank you, sir...?
My name is Bond.
James Bond.
Xénia Zaragevna Onatopp.
Are you top?
Your accent... Georgian?
Perspice, Mr. Bond.
Trips to Russia?
I made little jumps there.
Go back and forth.
It's changed a lot.
A country of Cocagne.
New Ferrari in every garage?
Not quite.
It belongs to a friend.
Pipe for your friend:
In France, Ferrari registrations of the year begin with 'L'.
Even counterfeits.
What rank do you have in the Grey Card Department... Mr. Bond?
Commander.
Let's go?
Sir is Admiral.
The prestige of the uniform!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.
All the pleasure, I'm sure, was for me.
Moneypenny's communication, I.D. confirmed.
Onatopp, Xénia. Former Soviet fighter pilot.
Suspected of ties with Janus, the Mafia of St. Petersburg.
The Manticore yacht serves as a cover for Janus.
'I'm allowing you to observe Miss Onatopp, but says:
No contact without a green light.
End of communication, Moneypenny, Good evening, James.
Xénia... I can't... breathe!
My respect, Admiral.
Nice to have you on board.
Ladies and gentlemen, take a seat on the bridge for the demonstration.
You will see Europe's response to the future electronic battlefield:
the first flying prototype of the 'Tigre' helicopter.
The Tiger is very manoeuvring and uses stealth techniques and is the only helicopter protected against electronic interference, radio interference and electromagnetic radiation.
I've got a surprise from your chambree friends.
I'm in the seventh sky!
Not yet.
Welcome the pilots.
Commander Bernard Jaubert and Lieutenant François Brouse.
Select Mir.
Visual signature projection.
Schedule interception with 2nd part of geostationary N°2. Collision 375 days
He wouldn't recognize a woman, even sitting on her nose.
Putting it on the Internet, right?
Password?
This time, I have an easy one.
Even you'd find him.
Bortsch in the dungeon!
I'll give you a clue.
They point at you and can open all the doors to you.
- A really frustrated kid!
I'm in!
You hacked into US Justice.
What if they go back to us?
The Chief of Computer Science will find me genius, appoint me in Moscow, and pay me a million real dollars.
Now I'm dreaming!
Besides, the Ricans are nullos.
They'll never detect me.
You were saying... nullos?
Nobody fucks Boris Grichenko.
Infiltrated!
Boris, hang up.
No!
I infiltrated them!
What's the password?
I won't tell you.
Let me guess.
It doesn't point in front of me.
You're sitting on it, but you can't go with it.
My program flips the line of anyone who wants to spot me, blocks his modem, which prevents him from hanging up.
The hunted game becomes hunter.
'Good luck for the next time, suckers!
Boom!
Left!
I'm invincible!
Was it good for you, too?
I'll have a coffee.
And I'm a cigarette.
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov.
Head of Space Division.
- If I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.
This is an unexpected control of Severnaia.
War simulation.
GoldenEye Shooting Test.
Please specify the situation.
Two operational satellites:
Petia and Micha, in 90 min orbit, altitude: 100 km.
Perfect.
Here's the authorization code.
Enter today's codes for GoldenEye and Petia.
I'll chronometer you.
Good.
Thank you, Major.
Countdown.
Three... two... one...
Target.
Severnaia.
Arm the systems.
Check it out!
They're reacting in 19 minutes.
Too late.
R.A.S. I had to oxygenate someone.
Good evening, Moneypenny.
Good evening, James.
I'll take you to the briefing.
I've never seen you after the office.
Nice.
Charming or combat outfit?
Murdered eyelids?
I know it's heartbreaking, 007, but I'm not staying at home waiting for an international slash, to jump here in a scratched dress and dazzle James Bond.
I went out with a gentleman.
Theatre night.
Moneypenny, you're stabbing me.
What would I become without you?
As far as he remembers, you never had me.
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.
Your behavior friezes sexual harassment.
Really?
How hard would I expose myself?
To the act, after your insinuations.
After you, Moneypenny.
No, I insist... on your honor.
Good evening, 007.
Tanner.
What's going on?
16 minutes ago, distress call from a disused station in Severnaia.
The satellite transmitted this.
We're holding a scoop.
Your Tiger who disappeared.
In the middle of North Russia.
Good view, 007.
Too bad the Wizard of the Numbers blocked you.
You were saying?
Nothing, I was just...
Perfect.
On a sarcasm level, my children spoil me, thank you.
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, 'M'.
The Prime Minister wants a topo.
Go on, Mr. Tanner.
Thank you.
After the distress signal, your helicopter took off.
The Russians have launched three Migs of interception.
What can this base be used for for Russians?
According to us, Severnaia could be the ground site of a coded space weapons program 'GoldenEye'...
They don't have any funds or technology to set up this complex.
The numbers aren't my strong suit.
Are we live?
Let the US learn the worst from CNN.
Negative for now.
Everything seems normal.
What the hell is that?
Natalia Fiodorovna Simionova.
Our satellite is out of order.
And two other Americans.
We've got another one coming in range now!
Oh, my God!
Two of the Migs are shot.
And the third hit the antenna.
What do you think?
No light.
Not a single electric light 50 km round.
I.E.M.?
- That's why the Migs were shot.
- And the blackout.
Electro Magnetic Impulse.
An anti-satellite weapon created by... Americans and Soviets during the Cold War.
I read, discovered after Hiroshima.
Explosion of a nuclear device into the atmosphere creates an impulse, a radiation, that destroys any electronic circuit.
The enemy finds himself without communication before he or they retaliate.
So GoldenEye exists.
Would it be an accident?
The helicopter.
To steal GoldenEye, it's the perfect wall pass.
The explosion was ideal to erase the package!
The Janus band?
They can be in the chopper's shot.
I know Russian security.
You don't show up asking for the key to the bomb.
You have to have the access codes.
There's gotta be a mole.
At least one person knows who he is.
All right, sir.
Thank you.
The Prime Minister had Moscow.
Accident in a fiscal year.
Governments are changing.
Lies continue.
What do we know about Janus?
Weapons theft specialists, based in St. Petersburg.
First suppliers to Iraq during the Gulf War.
Their boss isn't registered, no picture of him.
As for the woman... Onatopp, it's our only confirmed contact.
A drink?
Your predecessor kept cognac... I prefer bourbon.
Ice cream?
We pointed out anyone who could have had access to Severnaia.
At the top of the list is one of your old friends.
Ourumov.
They promoted him to General.
He already sees himself the Iron Man of Russia.
Our political scientists ruled him out.
He doesn't have the profile of a traitor.
The same people who said GoldenEye doesn't exist?
That the helicopter had no threat and was not worth following?
You don't love me.
Not my methods.
You think I'm an accountant, believing more in his numbers than in your flair.
- The idea touched me.
For me, you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur.
A relic of the Cold War, whose childish charm - without effect on me - fascinated the young woman who evaluated you.
- That's a good one.
- That's not all, 007.
If you think I don't have the balls to send an agent to death, your flair will leave you.
I wouldn't hesitate to send you to death.
But not out of whims.
Although you're out of your mind with life.
Find GoldenEye, his thief, what they're planning to do with it, and stop everything.
And if you meet Ourumov, guilty or not, don't give yourself up to a vendetta.
Venger Alec won't bring him back.
You didn't kill him.
Neither do you... without being offended.
Never.
Come back alive.
Good morning, General Ourumov.
Mr. Michkine, Minister of Defence.
Please make your report.
As the Council knows, three days ago, the secret GoldenEye weapon exploded on Severnaia.
As Chief of Space, I personally led the investigation.
I have concluded that this crime is the work of Siberian separatists seeking to destabilize the government.
Unfortunately, the peace and the much needed funds in Severnaya have been delayed for years.
So I'd like to present my resignation.
The Council does not want your head, Arkady Grigorovich, but your word that there is no other GoldenEye.
I'll give you the assurance.
So, where are the two missing technicians?
I've only heard one of them:
Boris Grichenko.
A woman has not been found:
Natalia Simionova.
Programmer.
I'll have an investigation, Mr. Minister.
It is presumptuous to attribute this incident to Siberian separatists before they have located your own elements.
Do you agree?
Yes, Mr. Minister.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
That's all.
Hello, 'Q'. Sorry about your leg.
Skiing?
Hunting.
Now, focus.
First, your new car.
BMW.
Five speeds, omnidirectional radar.
Self-destruction system, and of course, all the usual refinements.
I am particularly proud of this.
Behind the headlights... Stinger missiles.
Excellent.
So you can relax after a rough day.
Do I have to remind you that you have 'authority to kill', but not to violate the road code.
- I wouldn't dare.
Let's take a look at the practicals.
Banal leather belt.
For men, 80 cm.
Close, close.
Are you done?
Perfect.
Banal leather belt... 'Q', I know this gadget.
Not the one with 25 m of call-back rope wrapped in the loop.
Fire... and it pulls you a pin, followed by a wire capable of bearing your weight.
I see...
What if there's extra weight?
It's for one person.
Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.
X-ray scanner for documents.
Pen with feather. Granada, category 4.
Three clicks... start the wick at 4 seconds.
Three more... defuse it.
How long is this famous wick?
Become a grown-up, 007!
Long live the well-cut feathers!
You're preaching a convert.
Let's ask Freddie to show us.
There you go.
Sorry, Fred.
One.
Two.
Three.
No criticism!
Was it written?
To the letter.
007, please, bring it back a little...
Bring back some of this material as it is.
Don't touch that!
It's my lunch!
In London, April is springtime.
Really?
Who are you, Mr. Weather?
Another Englishman who swallowed an umbrella, with his secret codes and passwords.
You're gonna have to learn how to break up a little bit.
My car's over there.
After you.
As you say, 'Decoint yourself.'
'In London, April is springtime. In St. Petersburg, we freeze them.' Does it sound rather public?
Show me the rose.
Please, no.
All right, all right!
Muffy?
My third wife.
Jack Wade, CIA.
James Bond, the value of pebrocs.
- Nice formula.
- Nice car.
She never let me down.
A lot of mud, but it's driving you.
Bond, are you gardening?
The wrench, Jimmy.
What do you know about Janus?
Zero.
Nada.
Chief unknown, but the plunger full of his calcif.
KGB.
The army.
Screwdriver?
He would live in an old Soviet missile-carrying train, something armored that travels the country so as not to become a target.
Give me the hammer, Jimbo.
No, the biggest one.
The mass.
Actually, we never find this guy, he's the one who finds you.
Behind it is the Russian mafia.
The best thing is, I'll tell you who's standing up to him.
Who is it?
An ex-KGB.
A tough guy.
He's boxing right leg:
Zukovski.
Valentin Dimitrievitch Zoukovski?
Yes.
You know him?
He's limping because of me.
Is that all you got?
How much do you need?
24 for the American School, 11 for the Swedes.
IBM compatible with 500 megabytes.
CD Rom... and 14/4 modems.
- You pay in dollars?
If the lady wants a demonstration...
Madam wants a demonstration model, and calm to test it.
Satisfied?
All in all, except for this interruption.
Let me understand you:
You shot him in the leg, stole his shot and his girlfriend!
And you want Zoukovski to hook you up with Janus?
Will you appeal to his good heart?
No, to his wallet.
That could work.
All right, curtain lift.
Valentin operates on N°23 Avenue.
You really want to do this?
His last impromptu visitor left on a cargo plane, in very small packages.
Have me repatriate to first class.
Natalia!
It's me, it's Boris.
One more fucking morning...
Free trade, it'll be my death.
Walther PPK... 7,65, only three men use it.
I think I killed two of them.
I've got pot.
I doubt it.
James Bond.
So charming, so worldly, so secret agent!
To the shaker, not to spoon it.
Still very strong for humor, Valentin. Or to impress the gallery.
Who strangles the cat?
We strangle a cat?
She's Irina, my mistress.
Very good.
Irina!
Get out of here!
So, Mr. Bond, what brings you around?
Still at MI6 or are you joining the twenty-first century?
I hear 'M' is a lady.
Do me a favor.
He wants me to do him a favor!
My knee... kicks me... every day!
Screaming when it's freezing.
You know what a Russian winter is?
- Tell him, Dimitri!
- Depends on...
Quiet!
For an ex-KGB, you surprise me.
My prowess was not to touch your knee, but to... miss the rest.
Why didn't you kill me?
Professional courtesy.
I will show you the same courtesy.
Kirov Funerarium.
4:00 p.m.
100 kg of C4 explosives hidden in a coffin.
Your man enters with the hearse, the money is exchanged, their man leaves with the hearse.
He'll get arrested with the explosives.
Miracle, your man will run away with the money, your money.
What do I owe you for this... arrangement?
Connect me to Janus.
What did he do to deserve you?
Stolen a helicopter.
I've got six!
And they're all out of order.
So what?
These thieves are also traitors.
They stole a nuclear weapon and killed innocent Russians in the wake.
What do you expect from a Cossack?
I've never seen him before, but he's a Lienz Cossack.
The pro-Nazi and anti-Russian group during the war.
He's in history.
At the end of the war, the Cossacks of Lienz went to the English in Austria, thinking of joining your country in its fight against the Communists.
But you betrayed them and sent them back to Stalin who had them shot:
women, children, families.
Not one of our exploits.
Though... they're ruthless.
They deserved it.
Connect me to Janus.
Tell him I'm investigating the helicopter.
Meet me at the Europe Hotel.
So we're even and he owes me?
That's right.
This weapon will be useless... commander.
Depends on what you call safe sex.
You're close!
Not enough for what I'm thinking.
You think you can hurt me?
You think you can subdue me?
Enough foreplay.
Take me to Janus.
- Is this it?
- Yes.
Quite frankly, I had a lovely evening.
Once again, all the pleasure has been for you.
I won't call you back.
It won't stop me from sleeping.
Sweet dreams.
Hello, James.
Alec?
Risen.
I'm no longer an anonymous star, an in memoriam at MI6.
What's wrong, James?
Lost your bag?
Your stoning formulas?
Why?
Unspeakable, especially from you.
Have you ever wondered why?
Why have these dictators been shot down, destabilized these regimes?
Back home: 'Bravo, nice job, but sorry, you risked your skin for a world that has changed.
That's why we were chosen.
I recognize you there.
James Bond, His Majesty's loyal tolerant, a defender of the so-called Faith.
Please, put this away.
You insult me thinking I didn't plan all your shots.
I trusted you.
Trust?
That's crazy!
And MI6 didn't know your parents were Cossacks from Lienz?
Once again, you're stupidly confident.
MI6 knew.
We're two orphans.
But if your parents gave themselves the luxury of dying in the mountains, mine survived British betrayal and Stalin.
Only, neither my father nor my mother could survive such a shame.
MI6 thought I was too young to remember.
And, ironically, the son worked for the state, whose betrayal forced a father to kill himself, after killing his wife.
That's why Janus.
The Roman god with both faces.
It wasn't God who made me that face. It was you, setting the trigger for three minutes instead of six.
Do I have to feel sorry for you?
You must die for me.
By the way, I really wanted you to walk in my combination, but I felt that 007 would stay true to his mission.
The pub closes.
Last drink.
For England, James!
Wake up!
Wake up, please!
I'm here!
- I'm here!
- Hurry!
Hurry!
Come on!
We're going to die!
Get us out of here!
I'm a little stuck!
All for free flying hours!
I'll help you.
Watch your head.
But let go of me!
Who are you?
- I'm here to help you.
- I don't know anything.
- I don't believe you.
They're coming back.
Follow me, or follow your friends who killed in Severnaya.
I've never been to Severnaia.
Your watch, yes.
Blocked by GoldenEye's breath.
And you escaped from the parabolic antenna.
- Who are you?
- I work for England.
The more you tell me, the more I'll help you.
But I don't know anything!
So let's see what you know.
My name is Natalia Simionova.
I was a programmer in Severnaia before...
Go on.
Who did this?
Alec Trevelyan?
I don't know that name.
Who's the mole?
The traitor?
Boris.
Boris Grichenko.
KGB or Army?
Programmer.
Anyone else?
They're gonna kill me, aren't they?
Trust me.
Trust?
I don't even know your name.
Good morning, Mr. Bond.
Sit down.
I'm the Minister of Defense, Dimitri Michkine.
How are we going to execute you?
What?
Without a poppie?
Without cancans?
This is the modern evil:
No more third degree interrogations.
An art that's gone.
Your humor leaves me with marble.
Where's GoldenEye?
Home, right?
I have an English spy, a programmer and the helicopter they stole.
A traitor makes you believe it.
- Who destroyed Severnaia?
- Who had the codes?
In Russia, terrorism remains punishable by death.
What about betrayal?
Stop it, you two!
Some thugs with their toys!
It's Ourumov.
He set off the gun.
I saw him.
You sure?
After the killing, he stole GoldenEye.
But why?
There's another satellite.
Another GoldenEye.
You said interrogations are no longer what they were?
Mr. Minister, I'm protesting!
This is my investigation.
You're crossing the line.
From what I'm learning, you're the one who's passing them.
I've seen that gun before.
In the hands of our enemy.
Do you even know who our enemy is?
Do you know that?
Guards!
Minister of Defence Dimitri Michkine, murdered by British agent James Bond.
He himself was shot dead after he tried to escape.
Guards!
They're in the archives!
Downstairs!
Trust me.
Faster!
By the alley!
Blast bumpers!
It's for!
Left!
Get out!
Either you bring me the most beautiful gift, or you sadden me.
Michkine found them before I did.
Is Bond alive?
He escaped.
Good for Bond, bad for you.
Sit down, my dear.
James and I shared everything.
Absolutely everything.
To the winner, the loot.
You'll like the place.
Maybe you'll even like it.
Stay with her.
Bond... it can only be Bond.
He's gonna derail us!
Maximum speed!
Break it down!
Be nice... die!
You first.
You... second.
Get up!
Situation analysis: desperate.
You have no support, no escape route.
I have the only exchange money.
Where is she?
Your fatal weakness.
Ourumov... bring her.
Charming creature.
She tastes like... strawberry.
I didn't know.
I know.
Back to square one.
Your girlfriend... or the mission?
Drop your gun and she'll live.
Ourumov... what did this Cossack promise you?
You knew that, didn't you?
- He's a Cossack of Lienz.
- In the past!
He'll betray you!
Like the others.
Really?
What's true is, in 48 hours, we'll be richer than God.
Mr. Bond will have only a poor funeral service.
Followed by Moneypenny and a handful of tearing restorers.
So... what's your choice?
Two targets.
And the time to shoot one shot.
The girl... or the mission?
Kill her.
She's nothing to me.
We'll see each other again in hell, James!
2.5 cm of shielding.
I'm fine... thank you so much.
Boris!
Yes!
What are you doing? Boris is on the network:
It saves.
By infiltrating him, I might know where they're going.
Come on, get us out of here!
Yes, sir.
Good luck, James, I set the trigger for six minutes.
The ones you gave me, I owe that to a friend.
What do you mean?
We've got three minutes.
Synonym of the buttocks?
Boris creates passwords: 'Sit on it, we don't go with it.'
Chair.
That's what I was saying.
30 seconds.
He's not in Russia, not in Germany, not in Paris, London, Madrid... 25 seconds.
New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco... 20 seconds!
Mexico, Rio, Miami...
Wait!
He's in Cuba, Havana.
You're destroying all your vehicles?
It's an imposed procedure.
'Voyous with their toys.'
I need to find a way to transport our trip to Cuba.
Our trip?
Can you disarm a weapon?
Depends on the weapon you want me to disarm.
So... tell me... are there any other 'imposed procedures' that I should know about, Commander?
Thousands.
But all I'm talking about is... the tip of my lips.
All my life, I've dreamed of going to the Caribbean.
It's so beautiful.
There's no cat.
Definitely, you're flashing on the engines!
Hey, Jimbo!
A little gift from the old man, how could I ever...
T... Z...
'Q'.
What are you doing here, Wade?
Banian figs.
I'm not here.
The CIA doesn't know everything, nothing's got to do with it.
Nothing to do with your incursion into Cuba, if you follow me.
Perfectly.
I borrowed a plane from the narcotics.
The Coast Guard and the Aero are in on it.
We provide you with 6 hours of discretion-radar.
Langley's last satellite survey.
Stay below 600 feet.
500 feet.
- Who is she?
- Natalia Simonova.
Natalia Simionova.
The Russian Minister of Transport.
Did you evaluate it?
From head to toe.
Perfect.
Looking for a parabolic the size of a football pitch?
There's no such thing.
We've seen every cigar on in Cuba.
There's one.
The same as in Severnaia.
Like your transmitters from Nlle-Zealand.
Never been there.
How does she know?
What if I need help?
Radio call.
I'll send you the Marines.
Braque left at the end of the track.
Cuba is 130 km to the right.
Last detail:
Don't touch the buttons.
I'm going to bomb.
Ciao, I trust you, but be careful.
He knows you're coming.
He was your friend, Trevelyan.
Now he's your enemy, and you're gonna kill him.
As simple as that.
In a word... yes.
Unless he kills you first.
Do you think I'm impressed?
You and your murders, your deaths... for what purpose?
To be a hero?
Every hero I know is dead.
How can you do that?
Be so cold?
That's how I stay alive.
That's how you stay alone.
On the train, when you told him to kill me and I was nothing to you, did you mean it?
Yes.
Basic rule:
Always check if the other bluff.
Turns 10 further south. Azimut 1-8-4.
Yes, sir.
Nothing.
There's nothing here.
Let's get this over with.
Wade was right:
No parabolic.
This time... Mr. Bond... all the pleasure will be for me.
You're waiting for your turn.
She liked to get laid.
Is the satellite in range?
Six minutes.
Prepare the parabolic.
It's too soon.
I'm not ready.
Run!
It's normal we didn't see her.
Come on!
The biggest bank card in the world.
They don't have to refuse it to me.
Micha's on the network.
Sir?
Kill him.
This guy's got a hard head.
Contact information for the lens?
London.
He's in touch with the satellite.
How can I stop him?
The transmitter up there.
Antenna in position.
Countdown.
Three... two... one...
God save the Queen!
The Central Computer.
Don't move.
Unpleasant surprise.
'Everything to be pleasant.'
Where's the girl?
Find her!
How's that old 'Q'?
Still doing a job?
The watch.
New model.
Do we still press there?
Juicy shot, Alec.
You steal the Bank of England via electronic transfer.
And that, just before you start GoldenEye, which will spray any trace of the transaction.
Ingenious.
But it's still a larceny.
Actually, you're just a robber.
The thief broke.
You're mean.
It's not just about 'crashing' bank files.
All of London's computing is aimed at:
tax files, stock exchange, credits, cadastres, criminal records...
In 16 min 43 sec... 42 seconds...
Global financial crisis.
All this so that Alec's madman gets back from the world 50 years ago.
Please spare me the Freudian verse.
Do your Vodka-Martini choke the screams of all your victims?
Do you make your friends forgive you for the death of those you haven't been able to protect?
England will learn the cost of treason in seasonally adjusted data since 45.
Welcome to the party.
Don't ever do that again.
It's not about your games anymore.
Humans are going to die!
I can't believe it.
She was in master mode.
Check his bike.
She's a freak.
A dead programmer.
A guidance officer.
She doesn't even have access to the firing codes.
Ignition rocket!
What the hell is going on?
We're gonna have a comeback in... 12 minutes.
It'll burn over the Atlantic.
She changed the access codes!
Then she'll restore them.
Go ahead... kill him.
He's nothing to me.
I can do it!
I can decipher his codes.
Then do it!
Tell him!
Give me the codes, Natalia!
Give them to me!
- Boris can break your codes?
- It's possible.
We have to destroy the transmitter.
By the way... I'm fine, thank you so much.
Do you know how to use it?
All right.
Hide.
- How long?
- Two minutes.
- Wait a minute.
- Keep it!
I'm restoring them!
If he moves... kill him!
I'm invincible!
You know, James... I've always been the best.
Alpha 1 to Helico.
Alpha 1 to Helico!
Talk to me!
For England, James!
No, for me.
I'm invincible!
You okay?
It's okay, thanks.
What if someone looks at us?
There's no one in a 40-mile radius.
Is that how you're gonna get me out of here?
Tobacco feet.
I promised you I'd be here, didn't I?
Hey, ho!
The Marines!
Will you finish your debriefing at Guantanamo?
- Ready?
- Not in that chopper.
No plane, no train.
Nothing moving.
Honey... what do you want to happen?
