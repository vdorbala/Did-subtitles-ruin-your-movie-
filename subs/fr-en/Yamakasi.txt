...
- What face?
The most difficult.
- Can I do her blindfolded?
- No question?
So, meet at 6:00 a.m.
-Kamel!
Kamel, come on!
Get out of here!
- Have you seen the time?
- Come on!
They're gonna make the Blueberries.
- I'm coming.
I'm sure it's gonna be deadly.
- Hello, the police?
I can't believe it.
- I was drinking!
- No, I don't believe you!
- Class!
- It's deadly!
- I won't do that..
..every day.
- Yours, the cavalry!
- Always late.
- Let's move!
- Come on!
Come on, guys!
Come on, let's get them!
They're bringing them back to me this time.
Police operation.
- An operetta!
- Get out of here.
- Call for backup.
- I'll give you one.
- Every morning, it's the same thing.
- They're here!
- Come on, guys, let's hurry!
- Come on, go, go, believe it, believe it!
We believe it!
- Hello, Commissioner.
-Too much is too much!
Don't think I'm a mariolle!
Everybody at the briefing!
YAMAKASl! 7 kids who think we're assholes!
This is Ousmane Dadjacan, alias Zicmu.
Perfect to open the ball!
- Your son?
- Go on!
-Excuse us.
- At three, we're going home.
1, 2, 3!
No, don't do that!
You're making too much noise!
No!
- The blunder!
- It's a piece of shit, and the next one gets screwed,...
..I'm putting him on foot for the week.
Jean-Michel Lucas, says Tango.
- The bazaar is always the same.
- What's going on?
- Hello, Miss Boutin!
- Well?
- But ma'am...
Well, let's get to work, we've lost enough time.
- He won't dance long.
This is Abdou Ngoto,...
It's a rocket!
- Let it go.
We'll get it next time.
- Wait, you'll see!
- If I get him, it'll heat up!
Speaking of grabbing, here's one that always escapes us.
Bruno Duris, nicknamed The Spider.
The Spider...
-Stop it, you're gonna frown my dress.
-Excuse me.
Can I go with you to work?
Come on, come on!
Malik Ndiaye,...
- Girls, look!
- Put the trampoline back on!
The trampoline!
- Affligant!
You're gonna laugh less with the next one.
Oliver Chen.
- No!
Thief!
Oh, no, that's not true!
- They think they're heroes.
- They're not criminals.
They didn't steal anything.
- We don't have time to waste.
If they want to play sports, let them play football!
- Chief...
- They must respect the laws!
Don't climb the buildings. Don't make fun of the representatives of the order.
Is that clear for everyone?
And to conclude, Ousmane Bana, Dit Sitting Bull.
-Come on, you're still the last one.
- One day, he'll fall.
The Japanese have the seven samurai,
The Americans, the seven mercenaries, and we have the seven pains!
Shut them up!
The city is not a zoo.
If we don't have a result, I'll call the special section for a safari!
Get to work!
- Oh, cousin, do you have any news?
- Yes.
- Are you fired?
- No, still not.
- And if not?
A friend will come to you to talk to you.
There's a big file on you and my boss doesn't get you right.
- It's more like a compliment.
- You should stop for a while.
Wouldn't you like a trip to the Alps?
Like chalet, pancakes and climbers every day.
- We don't give a shit.
Have you ever thought about the parents?
- What parents?
The kids admire you and want to do the same.
You're trained.
But they won't.
I'm just a little detective.
My decision-making power is small, even small, and since I'm Arabic, that power you divide it by two.
You're gonna have to help me.
- Tonight, my mom's having a little party at home, making a chicken combo.
- If your mother does it...
-Yamakasi!
- Come on, we're playing Yamakasi!
Come on, Djamel!
- I can't because of my heart.
- You don't want to do a gym?
Are you a chick?
- I'm not allowed!
- You're gonna be ashamed of yourself!
- Come on, get in!
- Show us!
Come on, everybody's looking at you!
Come on, come on!
Come on, Djamel!
- Show us you're a Yamakasi!
- You're almost there.
-Don't fuck with me!
- Go ahead, come on.
-Djamel...
Djamel!
-Djamel!
Djamel!
- Hello?
It's Mrs. Gu√©rin from the school.
It's about Djamel.
-Djamel?
She speaks Arabic. ...
- Hello?
- Hello. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
He wasn't supposed to make any effort.
- It happened at school.
-Ah, yeah, school...
What's going to happen?
- There, we have 24 hours to do a transplant.
- He's on a list?
- Yes.
But it's complicated.
He's on a priority list, but we need to find a donor.
..and the list moves all the time.
- But there's nothing to do?
-Come with me.
- That's what I was afraid of.
There's nothing in France.
- What can we do?
- We have to wait.
An organ can arrive at the last minute.
Hopefully.
- And elsewhere than in France?
- There, we have to go through an intermediary company.
We can watch.
I've got one in Switzerland.
Healthy donor, expected death soon.
That's the ideal.
- Well?
- It's a heart that's not reserved.
He'll be free in a few hours.
- And... how do we... ..for this option?
- Officially, there's nothing we can do.
..but I can try to contact them.
- Yes, go ahead, we agree.
- It's very expensive.
- Oh, good?
- 400,000 F!
- We don't have them.
- Ask your neighbors, your loved ones.
With everyone's help, it can go fast.
- What about the security?
- She'll pay for the transplant.
The rest is not legal, so no refund.
Come on... to help you, I'll take the risk.
Here, I took an option on it.
He's booked.
Djamel has a new heart waiting for him.
You've got until noon tomorrow.
- You want us dead?
Turn it down, my head's gonna explode.
-Take an aspirin.
You're hurting me!
Honestly.
- They're cool, buddies.
- Be careful!
- I'll go get a sponge.
- That's it!
- Are you on the diet?
- It's to be taken in the middle of meals.
- Because you're only half in?
I bought two kilos of lemons, they disappeared.
No one would have seen...
- I'm practicing.
-Take the bananas.
- You run fast, but you're not ready to catch the light!
- You're not going home?
- Is there a problem?
A kid fell, little Djamel.
You know him?
- Aila's brother?
He's in resuscitation.
- What happened?
- He climbed the tree of his school, to play and do like the big ones.
Vincent, it's good to see you at home again!
Never in uniform!
- I'm in the office.
You have to be beautiful!
- When we do for you, we don't do a part!
We climbed the eastern side of the Bleuets in less than 10 minutes.
As usual, I'm the fastest.
- That's for sure, Rocket,...
..you're fast.
- Thanks, I'm fine.
-How do you want to catch the thieves?
-Fatima, don't do this!
- I don't want my son kidnapped.
-Fatima, come back!
- I'll take care of her.
-Aila!
-Fatima!
- Mom!
-Fatima!
- I don't need anything.
My son needs help.
- We'll sit down and find a solution.
..for your son.
Look at me.
There's always a solution. Trust me.
We'll take care of Djamel.
Trust me!
...
You're such an asshole!
- We saved your mother.
- And who's going to save my brother?
Is that you with your pirouettes?
Djamel, he's going to die!
-Calm down.
- We never wanted that!
- We don't hurt anyone.
We even saved an old woman who was stealing her bag.
- That's right.
She didn't even say thank you.
- We're not criminals.
- Wait!
- We're not irresponsible.
Let's get up.
At 6:00 a.m. to do this!
- Don't be blind.
The kids don't expect to be allowed to do bullshit.
- So, what do we do?
- You stop.
Climbing and everything.
- And we're sticking to the glue?
- Don't be smart.
- Do I do my smart thing?
- You're gonna regret not being in uniform.
-Tell me otherwise.
Enough drama!
You want to fight more?
We're gonna do the only thing we can do.
We'll take over.
- What are you doing?
- We came to see Djamel El Hadj.
- Visits are over.
- It's important.
You can't go home.
-Michelin!
Just five minutes.
- Can we come in?
Wow, so cool, thanks for coming.
Did you make the Blueberries on the east side?
- That's right.
- The eggs must be bad.
- They're blue green!
- Blue green chickens!
When I grow up, can I be a Yamakasi?
It's hard to become Yamakasi, but if you really want to, we'll teach you.
- You have our word.
- Where did they come from?
I'll call you back.
We don't have an appointment.
- It's for Djamel.
- Ah, I see.
I don't know what to tell you.
- Try the truth.
- You're gonna let him die?
- I've already taken the risk of putting an option. I can't do anything else.
The hospital cannot finance this transfer.
That's impossible.
We can't pay.
- Who are these people?
The HTC company.
- And if we borrow the money,...
We can pay them back every month.
- Even if I wanted to, I should ask the board.
There's seven of them!
- Then call!
Whenever you want, you can.
- Try, you'll see, it's simple as a phone call.
- No, I can't. I can't call everyone because...
- Because a child is going to die?
- No!
Give me that!
- Is that your kids?
- Leave it!
Enough of it now!
I'll give you a minute to leave the hospital or I'll call the cops!
- You'll get your money tomorrow at noon.
- They're letting a kid die for money!
- They'd deserve a snitch!
- Do you have any idea?
- We're in France.
We don't give up people.
- It's true in your law books, but not in reality.
A kid in the city who doesn't have any money, he's dying!
We need to find a solution, there must be banking.
- We don't even go to a club, so how do we get into a bank?
We'll go home with a gun, can you lend us yours?
- Leave me two hours.
I'm going to the office.
We'll figure it out.
You, you do with your law, us with our hearts.
The first one who saves Djamel won.
- Don't do anything stupid.
I'll do everything I can, you have my word.
- Where did you get this?
- I stole it from the doctor.
- These are the addresses.
- They'll know us!
-Violence doesn't solve anything.
- We're going to smoke them anyway!
- We'll tell them a story.
Take the rich to give back to the poor. Doesn't that remind you?
- Yes, Robin Hood!
Rachid's little sister, she's got it on tape.
- There, we don't really fly.
We'll give them back the money.
It's big!
- I like it.
- Hell, the concept!
-Mortel, the plan!
- We're gonna end up in jail.
- We all agree?
- What do I do?
I'd like to help little Djamel too.
- You're staying in stand-by.
If it goes wrong, we'll call you.
- Great.
- Meet me at 5:00.
- So, Detective, are we insomniac?
- Have you seen what time it is?
-Excuse me.
- If my father saw you...
Something's happening to me.
It's really important.
If we don't see each other again...
I mean, if we're gonna see each other again... I'm really not good at making love declarations.
You're gonna be proud of me.
- Maybe we found a solution for Djamel.
It's gonna take a little time.
I'll be away today. I can't point.
- I'll take care of it.
We're doing three groups, two breaks each, 60,000 per break.
- What if there's no cash?
- Jewellery, passports, credit card.
See you at 10:00 at the last address, two hours per mission, it's time to do the right thing.
Do it right.
Keep the cell phone.
- I have two batteries!
- 5:30.
- Fourth floor.
-Leave it, it's the kitchen.
- It's not time to eat.
Shall we go?
- No, no.
We've got four hours to save Djamel.
- The police!
- Thank you.
Mr. Minister's not here.
- Then his counselor.
I know it's early in the morning.
- Do you have an appointment?
- It's about a child...
- Do you have an appointment?
- We have to act before noon.
- We have to make an appointment.
Send him a letter and...
- There, there's a real urgency!
- That's not possible.
I'm sorry, he's very strict.
- This child is going to die!
Stay calm and call the counselor.
- What's going on?
- Inspector Asmine.
I'm sorry.
..but you have to save a child.
- I didn't know I had so much power, but so much the better.
Go to my office.
Please, after you.
Settle down.
- You know, man, he can paint.
- It's bubbling.
We didn't say anything big, nothing heavy.
...
...
- It's unbearable this music!
...
- Where did you learn that?
- "Mission impossible."
- I know where.
- Wait, we can't leave him without culture, that man.
...
That's why I insisted.
- You did the right thing.
We must remember that we are at the service of the people. Your gesture honors you.
Are you going to help me?
- I'll call the army hospital department.
Otherwise, I'll call General Commander Air Force.
- Thanks for Djamel.
- You're welcome.
- Isn't life beautiful?
A house for us.
You scared us.
- You're serious!
There's alarms everywhere.
- Don't worry.
- Easy.
- A little too easy for me.
Too heavy.
- Fragile.
-Too cool.
- Oh, no!
- His race!
...
-They're all on one side!
Let them go up, now!
...
- "30 million friends," my ass!
They're not on the list.
- I hope the others have better.
- We'll catch up with the next one because I'm not going back.
-Aila, it's Vincent.
- Yes.
- I have some good news.
The minister's counselor received me.
He's been sensitive to our story, finally, in Djamel.
He's going to step in. I'm waiting for news.
- That's good, but...
What exactly is he gonna do?
- We have a plane, men, a whole logistics.
You want to tell me they're gonna move this whole world to Djamel?
- Yes, I assure you, it's not a joke.
Do you doubt me?
- No, but everything else.
- Run, Aila. Only a few hours and Djamel will be saved.
You have to believe it.
- Asmine!
What the hell is this?
You're a cop, not a social worker!
Do you understand?
They just yelled at me.
Why did you insult an advisor?
Are you crazy or what?
- I didn't insult him!
- He says you've told stories to sleep up!
- That's not true.
- Don't give a shit!
You're gonna have to deal with the shit that's falling on us!
- I don't understand.
- Stop being naive!
It's a kid's life.
We're not the pope, we have to execute.
..orders.
A dead kid isn't our problem!
We're the base, the cement.
And cement doesn't mean it's colmatose, everyone gets their job.
Take care of this.
- You're going to operate on him?
Djamel can't stay here.
- Why?
- We'll leave him here.
- In the hallway?
We'll keep an eye on him.
- You treat him like a dead man.
-Deaths are upstairs.
We're five to take care of everyone at this level.
We've got two injured.
- My brother's not sick enough?
- For now, there's nothing we can do for him.
We'll take care of him when it's his turn.
What you should do is stay close to him.
-Slowly, dogs!
- Hello, police.
- Come in, come in.
Come on, hop!
- You're coming for the burglary?
With the two clebs, they couldn't visit.
They went in there and neutralized the case.
Then, straight to the living room.
- They were several?
- They were filmed.
I've got eight cameras all over the house. I've filmed the lascars.
- I've been robbed five times!
- What are you doing?
- Chirurgien. I'm never here.
- They're agile.
- They must be acrobats.
- May I?
..other breaks in the morning.
-A little coffee?
- Yes, thank you.
- Yeah, me too. Can I connect?
- There's a hold against the wall.
- You've got a flair.
Do you know how many acrobatic cases I have?
Four since this morning.
Find out if there's any connection between the victims?
A sports club, a car...
- They're all doctors.
- That's what I was afraid of.
- How's it going?
Henri Picard, do you know him?
- He's a colleague.
Pierre Gautier, Jacques Bernier?
- We're on the board of directors.
- The 7 directors of the same company.
- 7th, you never see him.
- Do you have a printer?
We have to warn the rest of them, they're going to have a visit.
I'll take care of the counselor.
- Goodbye, sir.
We'd have to give the case back to Paris.
- Don't worry.
- Seeing the circumstances and your appointment this morning...
- You're not here to think, you're here to execute.
Ring of the front door.
- It's the police.
- We're looking for burglars.
- They're gonna try to operate here.
- But it's amazing!
- No panic, we're here!
- Please, come in.
- It's pretty.
- It's a Klimt.
- We don't bother, we take a walk.
- Yes, go on, go on.
- There's nothing there.
- You think they've been here before?
-It's better to prevent than cure.
- We, when we do our job...
We do it to the end.
A priori, there's no one. A priori, everything's fine. I'm saying a priori.
- With these guys, you have to be wary, they're real air currents.
At the rate they're breaking up, they've got to be runny.
- They're not dangerous?
- We never know, ma'am.
...
- Have you searched everything?
- You can sleep alone.
- What if they come?
- Don't worry.
We've blocked the whole building.
Even a little mouse wouldn't pass.
Thank you. I feel reassured.
- That's normal.
Ten more minutes, and I was taking her away.
-Ah!
My God, my Klimt!
They stole it!
But look behind you, you fools!
-Andre!
-Nothing to report!
- My Klimt!
- They're gone!
- They stole my Klimt!
- But...
Andre, they're on the roof!
Go over there!
We didn't go out.
- They're here!
- They're here!
This way!
- You know, they don't want to let us go.
- They're here.
-Police, calm down!
-Come here!
Come on!
- I guess you don't have a plan C?
Hands on my head! I ran!
-Maybe on your head!
- Come on!
- A...
-Stop it!
Stop!
-Shits!
- I'm not going there.
- Ludo!
Ludo!
- I know, I finish my homework and I'll clean up my room.
- Let's go around!
- Yes, that's it!
Oh, fuckers, fuckers!
- It'll make him happy when he sees you.
- They're here, I saw them.
- Who?
Who's there?
- The spirits who look after me.
- No injuries?
- Nothing yet.
- How's it going?
-Lently.
-Activate instead of watching us.
- Enough bullshit!
- So, did you see your minister?
- Yeah.
- It's moving on.
- Let's go.
- You seem to forget that I'm a cop.
-Changing of trades.
- I'm fighting for laws.
- And we fight for Djamel.
Leave us.
- It's going to end badly!
The cops are going to duck you!
He thinks he's Clint Eastwood.
Or I'll blow you off!
You really don't understand anything!
The law is there and if I sit down on my convictions, I'm nothing.
It's our beliefs that make us respect each other.
- We think a kid's life...
It must not depend on the bad will of a doctor full of ace.
We're gonna save him.
- There are alternatives to theft.
Aila and her mother, we meet them every day.
What do you want us to do when we see them again?
We're ringing.
What's that for?
-Ah!
- Punt, the furious house!
Did you see the size?
- There's doors everywhere.
- Let's split up.
See you outside.
- A burglary in my house?
I'm the one who called.
- They're here?
- Sure.
- What guy?
African?
- Why?
It's a mess!
- Answer me.
- No special sign.
- What a sense of observation!
Come on, get your talkies!
...
Attention, call for backup!
- In the closet.
Shit, there's eggs everywhere!
-Shit!
- We're not home!
- I prefer dogs.
- I hope there's a plan B.
- Keep searching.
Isn't that a special sign for you?
Maybe it's not them.
Now let us do our job.
- What are you doing here?
- I do my job.
I'm the one who warned about the burglary.
- You can get out of here!
- It's blocked everywhere.
- I'm Commissioner Orsini, in charge of the operation.
You've got burglars in your house.
We stuck them in the middle of a flag.
- What are you waiting for to throw them out?
- We have to get ready.
- Would there be servants inside?
Now hurry up before they destroy everything!
- My section is no more delicate.
Get that shit out of my house or I'll call your superiors.
- As you wish, Mr. Counselor.
- They're throwing smokers.
- All on the 1st!
- What are you waiting for?
-Donate the assault.
- Charge!
I have to find an idea. I can't feel it.
- Maybe I have a solution.
Phone ringing.
- We need you right away.
- Okay, I'm coming.
- What's he doing?
-The main door is broken. *There is active resistance.
-Progress. * methodical calm.
- What the hell are they doing?
- Cleaning.
- Let's get out of here!
- We're getting both civilians out.
- Call the Samu!
- You told me no one was there.
- Yeah... well, besides the good one and... I'm not watching them!
There may be other civilians inside.
You have a way to put pressure on a lot of things,
..but you will not prevent me from recording in my report..
..your irresponsible attitude.
- Look if there's a hatch on the roof.
There's nothing in the back.
There's a problem, there's even two.
-What's your name?
-Carlos.
- Jean-Pierre.
- Is this your house?
- I'm Carlos' boyfriend.
-What level?
- Level three.
*
- New dam.
- We have two kids with us.
Get out of here and we'll give them back to you.
- The two kids, are they part of the staff or are they yours?
I don't understand. I have a 10-year-old son, but he's on the horse.
I don't understand!
- The maid lives in your house?
- On Wednesdays, she has to take them.
- Go check it out.
Please leave the place, you're not helping us at all.
- I know what I have to do!
- Get out of here or I'll get you on board!
- Come on, kids, go this way.
- Jean-Pierre, you'd have to do a little less console and more gym.
My arm!
Help me!
- Let him go!
Sitting Bull and his friends cough.
I asked to let it go before I acted!
- That's what we did.
- What's wrong with them today?
- This way.
- Good job!
- Yeah?
- Where are you?
- A hundred yards.
Wait, I'm trying to get through.
I'm just 50 yards away.
- Get out of here and hurry up.
And no phone in the car!
- They're worse than the cops here than we are.
Go to the foot of the north face.
- Okay.
Bring the money and the jewels to put them in a bag.
- Get up against the wall.
- What's the matter?
- I live...
- Come back in an hour or two.
If I don't take my medicine, I'm dead.
I could die..
I saw shadows on the second floor.
- Orsini for raid 1.
We saw them at the windows on the second floor.
- I'll be there in 10 seconds.
- I see you.
At zero, give me a nice home run.
- Okay.
- Your turn, Baseball.
-Stay against the wall!
- Yes!
- They're on the roof.
- Yankee 0.
- Now, remember this story.
Hands up.
It's a controlled situation.
- Not too soon.
Thanks, Asmine, come with us to the precinct.
The adviser's report may be salty.
Forward!
Are you coming?
- I've got my car.
- Good news.
The donor's dead.
We have to hurry..
..and give an answer.
Where are you with the money?
- Money's coming.
It'll be there at noon, as planned.
At the right time!
- We didn't go out.
Don't you have a plan to get out of there?
- It was the jail or the hospital.
- I'd rather have been in the hospital.
- You would've gone to jail anyway.
- I hope Djamel's gonna make it.
- Are you dreaming?
- Why?
- We gave the turkey the money.
He's going to get stripped fast!
-How much?
-227 500 F
- For all of it?
- Yes.
I know it's a lot, but it's for a good cause.
- If it's for the right cause, then, deal.
There's the chief who wants to see you.
- Go ahead, we're listening.
- With the buddies we came to Paris to change air.
- The suburbs, it's not the best.
We like to visit chic neighborhoods.
It's like a free museum.
- A sumptuous palace.
-The tower for Cinderella!
- We heard screams, screams.
- As if the Cinderella was being killed.
- We didn't have the reflex to call the cops.
-Keufs scare pitbulls, so we don't trust each other.
- We jumped the gate, but there was an open window.
- There were two scumbags.
- Five guys with shaved skulls.
-6!
- And I'll beat you up, poor woman.
They took potatoes!
- You would have acted..
..the same way.
- Then the keufs came in!
- And in the meantime, the scoundrels are in the trunk.
- We realize that with our mouths, we're never gonna believe each other.
- Are you kidding me?
It's the truth. I swear on the heads of my two brothers.
- On my father, I can't swear.
He's dead.
- I'd spit, but you're not gonna like it.
- To the gnouf!
Have you ever read anything like that?
-Unfortunately, that's the truth.
I'm a witness to that.
- It'll make things easier. I hope he has good assurance.
- It'd be better.
-The seven dwarves!
Out!
The inspector testified in your favor.
Get out of the way!
-Aila!
Aila, I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
- You can count.
400,000 F in cash before noon.
- Yes, but it's 12:10.
- We apologize for the delay.
Now call your classmates.
- They got another offer at 500,000 F. I held them till 12:05, after, they didn't want to know anything.
I'm so sorry.
- You sure?
Have you tried everything?
I think we're gonna lose patience.
- Back off or I'll shoot in the pile!
I'm calling the police!
She's already here.
I'm going to approach you slowly so you can read it.
Is that close enough?
Can you read it?
It's marked "National Police".
Put the gun down.
- Hit a civilian, when we don't have that card,...
It can be picked up within 12 months of prison.
Let's forget the police and talk about man to man.
How much you value..
Your life?
Come on, let's be generous.
100,000 F + 400,000 F, that's 500,000 F.
If in two hours, djamel doesn't have a new heart,
We're not getting along anymore!
- I'm proud of you.
- Yeah, but watch out for my jacket.
- Pretentious!
- I have good news.
- I'm making a tape..
..for Djamel.
*
As soon as you get out, don't forget.
There's practice!
-Yamakasi!
