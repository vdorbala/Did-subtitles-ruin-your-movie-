This is how a person, from point A, gets to point Z.
Some will say that it is fate, others, chance.
Whatever the name, it's a really interesting question, isn't it?
The winding paths our lives take.
How did you get there?
That place you're in right now.
How did you end up here at this very moment?
Where are you in life?
Did everything go the way you planned it?
And by the way, when was the last time you talked to your parents?
Don't you think you should call them?
To thank them for the combination of circumstances that brought them together, in a certain place, at some point in time, when you were conceived.
What were we talking about again?
About you coming to Earth.
I can't believe it!
I'm still too...
Broken?
A glass of orange juice would be perfect, wouldn't it?
With Tostitos.
It would!
I was thinking exactly about that!
Orange juice and Tostitos!
It's like you're reading my mind.
I do.
Then go on.
What am I thinking now?
A lot of thoughts go through your mind.
The first concerns orange juice and Tostitos, and the second... the second thought, it upsets you.
- What's that?
Why are you talking to Roscoe Lee Browne?
Shit!
You're famous!
Yes, I am.
I can't believe I'm talking to Roscoe Lee Browne!
You ready for the third one?
You're saying I'm ready, Roscoe!
Your third thought is just that:
How did I land on that big wheel?
How do you know?
Because, you dirty hippie, you're talking on your own.
Shit.
How did I end up here?
I think it was a little too soon to get high.
But, you know, I'm not staying my ass in my chair waiting for my parents' checks.
I did a commercial for a soda a while ago.
The famous Root Beer of Doctor Bjorn.
Maybe you saw her?
I mean, between these and my allowances, I'm fine.
I can tell you this game is cool when you're stiff.
It is said that a big smoker stops snacking, reached a certain point.
Finally, the big smoker doesn't even use the word "griggle." The big smoker says instead:
"Groaning" or "bumping" something like that.
In any case, I love eating when I'm stiff.
So, excuse me if you're too cool to be hungry when you're stiff.
My Doctor Bjorn stock, free for 1 year.
Cool, huh?
I've been living with my roommate, Steve, for six months.
I've never seen him get high.
Not once.
He even looks at me strangely when I do.
You're really pathetic.
Here's the thing with Steve.
He scares me.
Hey, Steve.
See?
He's the kind of guy to dress up and line up to see Star Wars, but he's a bad guy.
Very antisocial.
I'm still trying to be nice to Steve, who knows what happens with a guy like that?
I know he put that word on for me, but I had a plan.
A great plan.
I was gonna make some cakes for Steve.
Even better.
A LAST TIME
Then I realized what the cakes I ate were made of.
Shit.
HEARING at 11:30 CASTING FOR THE BEST OF TIME.
Listen, Jane.
I broke my ass to get you this audition, so please, don't mess it up.
Looks like you don't give a shit.
You don't care?
I don't care.
A plan... needs a plan.
My plan.
Number one:
buy more weed.
With this, I'll do some cakes for Steve.
Number two, take the money Steve left for the electricity, to pay for the weed.
So I can make the cakes before he gets home.
Then I'll go to my audition.
Which brings me to number three:
Go to my audition.
I've never been to an audition so high, but I can bet I'll be very good, because I'll be in tune with my creative part!
That's not really part of the plan.
Four: go to the distributor, withdraw to pay for the electricity, buy the ingredients of the cakes and come back to make them.
Not bad... for someone who's completely stoned.
You're stiff.
Why do you say that?
You see, the routine.
Give me 30 grams well packed.
I'll make some cakes.
It's working.
What's going on?
Who's there?
Is anybody in my house?
You're really high.
Number one:
buy more weed.
You're 40 missing.
Can I... you know...
Oh, my God, Jane, this is the last time.
You have to pay me today.
I'll write it in the notebook.
I just have to go to the vending machine, buddy.
It's all about capitalism and shit like that.
Who creates jobs?
Where did they come from?
My profits, for example, come from the economic system, without my understanding.
That's right.
I agree with you, man.
It's Reagan's economy, applied to grass production.
I don't think it looks like Reagan's economy, but...
What are you talking about?
The absence of taxes on grass does not mean that there is a... a paradigm of the free market.
Did you just say "paradigm"?
Yeah.
It's great what you do, God bless you, but for me, it's good old capitalism.
- It's Reagan's economy, I tell you.
- Why Reagan's economy?
The black market is not taxed!
Jane, you're too high, and I can see him miles away.
You've got a U.V. lamp. The revolution's on!
But what do you know about the economy?
I took an economics option in college, and I graduated from Summa.
I think I know what I'm talking about.
I thought you were an actress.
Economy wasn't really my thing.
I'll be there.
Bring me the money at 3:00.
What's this?
I don't know half of these movies.
My roommate is organizing this... science fiction night for geeks this weekend, with his buddies coming from Toledo and... 3:00 p.m.
Come see me in Venice, with the money, at 3:00.
Don't make me ask my associates to use the hard way.
- You mean, kill me?
- Of course not.
You're just gonna break my arms?
Break your arms?
What's wrong?
I sell weed, I'm not Tony Soprano.
So, what?
I don't know.
Take your furniture, for example.
Tell me, Jane, what's your roommate's problem?
- What's wrong with him?
- He's freaking me out.
It must be a skull asshole.
You see the thing?
I'm sure this guy's fucking skulls, with candles and all the mess.
Oh, my God!
You're right!
- He's a fucking freak.
- Then listen to me.
It would be silly not to pay today, because besides taking your furniture, I'll tell your roommate what you did with the electricity money.
Hello?
Is that...
Who's that?
It's Kyle.
Hey, honey, are you okay?
You asked me to call you back to remind you of your audition.
Are you stiff?
Help?
It's eleven o'clock in the morning!
You know, Jane, it doesn't work between us.
I don't understand.
You're talking in riddles.
Kyle, listen very carefully to what I'm gonna tell you and don't try to confuse me.
Wait, Kyle!
I can't hear you!
Don't hang up!
I'm gonna...
Shut up!
Shit.
Kyle?
Are you still here?
What am I gonna do?
I can't.
I don't dare.
I shouldn't.
The government weed.
I kept it for a special occasion, but the government weed will bring me a nice sum if I sell it.
A very nice sum.
Maybe enough to get me out of this mess.
Number three:
Go to my audition.
It was intense.
Are you going up?
I've never taken the bus to L.A. It must be fun.
You're going to have a good time.
You crushed Bobby's car.
It took three weeks to build it.
- Look what you did.
- I saw her, she fell.
She didn't even try to get up.
- $1.35!
- Wait.
- Get up.
- I'm trying.
- There's something wrong with her.
- Nothing's wrong, ma'am.
Why was she on the floor?
She wasn't, junkie!
You dropped him out of his hands.
- I saw her.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not gonna fix his car.
- She must be drugged.
He made it for his grandfather, who's in the hospital.
Miss!
$1.35!
I get it!
I escaped it beautiful.
"Come on, Frank.
"You know I like surprises.
"That's right.
I always have to make exceptions."
"Come on, Frank.
"You know I like surprises, that's for sure,
"I always have to make exceptions."
Four:
Go to the vending machine.
I have more than $1,000 on this account!
Take your furniture, for example.
No!
Not my bed!
Not my bed Bultex!
You forgot to sign.
"Come on, Frank.
You know I like surprises. "
Sit down.
Hello.
Don't you have a gum?
I...
Wait.
Damn it!
Where did it come from?
- You want some?
- No, thank you!
Are you sure?
I really need money.
No, I don't want it.
200 bucks.
No, I don't want that.
I'm really high.
I'm sorry.
Yes!
Present!
- Are you ready?
- You bet!
- Hello.
- I'm Jane, I'm delighted.
I've... heard a lot about you.
Excuse me?
Nothing.
- Is everything okay?
- I'm freaking out!
What about you?
- It's okay.
- Great!
Wait a minute.
- What?
Did you talk?
- Who, me?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, I had to talk out loud.
Are you ready?
Definitely.
Are you ready?
Definitely.
"Come on, Frank!
You know I like surprises!"
Do it again, but this time, with more restraint.
All right.
It's working.
"Come on, Frank.
You know I like surprises. "
- What are you doing?
- I'm holding back.
Not so much.
Can you find a middle ground?
You're saying I can find a middle man!
Right in the middle is my second name!
Thank you.
- So how was it?
- It was a very interesting job.
Really?
Well, thank you.
I wish you a great day.
Can I ask you something?
You want to buy some weed?
Are you trying to sell me drugs?
Miss, go sit outside!
- You don't have to scream.
- Sit down!
- Here?
- In the waiting room!
Bob, come here!
...trying to sell me marijuana.
I was joking.
What did she try to sell you?
I'm a pain in the ass!
Wait a minute!
I'm shitting!
I'm a pain in the ass!
I'm shitting again!
Nothing to worry about.
I'm demolishing a big cake.
That's it, that's it.
I'm done.
You got nothing against me!
Nada, zero!
Come search me!
Hello, Smiley.
Hey, Jane.
Come see me in Venice at 3:00.
You better go.
I was just gonna do it, Smiley.
It's Shelly, leave me a message.
Guess who that is?
I'm looking for someone to take me to the weed festival in Venice.
That sounds cool, doesn't it?
I thought you'd be interested.
But I don't think you're here.
Shelly, I'm too high, you can't even imagine!
Call me.
Hey, leave a message for me or Tony after the beep.
Who's that again?
Hello?
Mrs. Green?
Yes.
It's Jane!
Who?
Jane!
You taught me the clarinet!
I don't know. I don't...
Brevin Ericson.
What a plague.
How about we talk about Brevin Ericson?
What if we talk about love?
Brevin Ericson is totally, 100 percent of love.
Maybe you're having a hard time understanding how you can be so attracted to someone like that.
But don't judge her too harshly.
After all, how could she know about space cakes?
And ask yourself, who among you wouldn't have done the same thing?
Who are we to judge the beatings of a young man's heart?
- You want "Lightning Strikes Thrice"?
- Yeah.
You want "Secret Secret Agents"?
- I already...
- That's right.
I find your roommate... pretty sexy.
Are you kidding?
You're too strong.
You amaze me.
Damn!
Brevin, right in there!
Okay, but...
- I thought you had a boyfriend.
- We're taking a break right now.
What does that have to do with it?
I'm talking about something more important than our little cravings.
Of course.
So, what do you say or not?
Well...
Come on!
It's gonna be the total transformation.
Sounds great.
I just have to...
What?
I...
Are you sure you want to come with me to the dentist?
Absolutely, man.
I can leave you in a coffee, if you want.
You don't have to, my dear.
I really want to see this.
Last week, they made the left side.
Today, they will finish the law.
And I can tell you, the scraping is very deep.
Deep scraping?
That sounds totally awesome.
I should make one.
You need a date.
A date.
That sounds funny.
I don't even know why I'm laughing.
So, how much do you need?
I don't know.
About five...
Dollars?
- Yeah, I have to borrow $5.
- What, then?
$500?
It should be okay.
Really?
If you can't, it's okay.
I can let this go.
- Can you?
- Will you give them back to me?
Absolutely, of course.
My wallet's in the glove box.
Can you take it?
I'm supposed to have five cents.
That would be great.
No.
I don't have them.
Let's stop at a distributor.
Why do you need $500?
Well...
I don't think Steve's fucking skulls.
Why put it in your glove box?
- What?
- Your wallet.
He's too big.
He hurts my ass when I drive.
That's good.
What?
- I've been to this house before!
- What house?
Right behind!
One of my former teachers lives there.
Really?
He was a nice guy.
What was he teaching?
Marxism.
Marxism.
He taught me a number of nice concepts.
Some pretty radical ideas.
Did you see him?
What do you mean, "You saw him?"
Did you see him?
You mean, go out with him?
- He was a fucking Marxist!
- Marxist?
How dare you ask that question?
- There's a place.
- Right there!
Come on!
You don't want to be late for your date!
Right.
Are you coming or what?
Are you scared?
Of what, the dentist?
It never bothered me to go to the dentist.
I don't care if I have to go in there.
I couldn't stand it.
I kind of like it.
I'm not a masochist.
I feel... resplendent.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
You feel resplendent, or I don't know what.
I'm shitting myself.
It's me.
I'll see you later.
When we meet again.
He's not my boyfriend.
He's just a friend.
If you were wondering about the nature of our relationship, or not.
How's it going?
Thank you, Gina.
Thank God!
It was the longest, most boring, most unpleasant thing I've ever lived.
I really thought I'd die of boredom.
I still have to pay.
Can't we go now?
What time did I pick you up?
Excuse me?
Why don't you get close when your friend talks to you?
Miss, come here.
Come here!
Look at me.
Look at me, I'm not kidding.
It's sunny, Officer.
Can you take your hand off your forehead? It's very sunny.
What's your name?
Christy?
You don't look sure.
No, it's Christy.
So, Christy... why did your friend call you Jane right now?
Jane, is that my... baptismal name?
Your christening name?
Am I under arrest?
Why would you be?
Should I be informed of anything?
No, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-
I mean, skate!
Sir, can you open your safe?
My safe?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
My car...
Tell me, I'm gonna find your drug in there?
Oh, my God, Jane!
It's not Christy, it's Jane.
I don't even know why you said that.
What have you got here, boy?
I don't know, stuff.
Some files I was supposed to bring to my dad's office, I didn't, because he's a jerk.
- What's that?
A tennis racket.
And the ball.
I want more, but my dog eats them.
Mr. Jack's head, trombones, shoes...
Hello.
Hello.
You're getting here a little early.
Are you going home or not?
Peter hasn't returned from the airport yet.
Sit down in the meantime, I'll get you this.
Are you drinking something?
Do you have lemonade?
No.
I'm sorry.
Orange juice?
It'll be fine.
All right.
Are you hungry?
Now that you're talking about it,
I'd like to snack.
Chips, anything.
I'll see what I got.
There you go.
Thank you.
- What's that corn?
- Excuse me?
It's a picture of Peter.
That must be his idea of the avant-garde.
How long have you been Peter's assistant?
Who?
- Professor Harwood?
- Yes.
For a while now.
It probably didn't work out with the other girl.
I guess so.
I'm delighted to meet you...
Jane.
I'm Shirley, Peter's mom.
Shirley, of course.
Peter talks about you all the time.
Really?
Constantly.
I'll give you what you came for, so you can go.
That's where popcorn comes from.
Maybe Professor Harwood's on one shot.
He must really like corn, and its derivatives.
We're supposed to put this in a frame.
The things we love.
I'll do it.
At home, I'll frame a lot of things I love.
Like lasagna.
I love lasagna.
It's too good, and full of cheese.
Do you know who loves them, too?
This cat loves lasagna.
I should frame a picture of Garfield.
It would be a hijacked way to say I like lasagna.
That would be so implicit.
Or how about a picture of President Garfield?
Damn it!
That would be crazy!
People would ask me, "Why do you have a picture of President Garfield on your wall?"
And I would say, "Because I like lasagna, of course."
Oh, my God, what happened?
Did you fall?
That's right.
I wanted to catch something and I got a bowl.
Are you all right?
It's okay.
You're hiding?
Of course not.
Why do you ask that?
Looks like you're hiding.
I don't know what you're talking about, Shirley.
- There he is.
- Great!
Thank you very much.
Peter must have told you, but he wanted to make sure I told you to take him straight to his office and put him in the trunk.
Of course.
I think that's it.
See you.
Fucking shit.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm waiting... for my laundry to dry.
It's my laundry.
I'm waiting for your laundry to dry, so I can... dry mine.
Where's your laundry?
In my bathtub.
Excuse me.
May I ask you a question?
Imagine you have a precious...
Let go of my arm.
I'm sorry, it's cool.
We're just talking.
Friends of Lavomatic.
Do you even live here?
That's not the point, buddy of Lavomatic.
Suppose a person owns, a very old... and precious...
- What kind of book?
A very influential book.
A book that changed history.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Dude, what's with the hostility?
- You're freaking me out.
- The scare?
Go away, before I call the cops.
Calm down.
If you want me to leave, I can go.
Thank you.
I'm going, buddy.
Goodbye, buddy.
It always comes at me.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
I was trying to...
I'm calling the cops.
Don't do that.
I'll give it back, I swear!
What can I do with a 200-year-old rotten book?
Don't put me on hold!
She's running away!
I'm a Marine Reservist!
You're torn!
Come on, Hercules.
The pretty pig!
The back of the van is open.
Facing west.
To Venice.
I don't see the connection.
Wait a minute.
It's coming.
It smells like sausage here.
It's time to review the plan.
Number one:
Go to the weed festival.
Number two, convince Steve not to steal my furniture.
Especially not my bed.
Everything, but not that.
Number three:
Once Steve is convinced, try to return the Communist Manifesto, without being arrested.
Send it by mail, maybe.
No, Chronopost is much more reliable.
That's what I call a great change of plan.
Next stop:
Venice, California.
What the fuck?
We're already in Venice?
Venice?
Miss, we're in El Monte.
Where?
You're killing pigs here?
They died when they arrived.
We keep them in the ice before we use them.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Albert, she's asking.
Guys!
- Bingo.
- What are you doing here?
Who are you?
You know the rules, Mikey.
No girlfriend in the factory.
Mr. Spencer, that's not my...
I'm not his girlfriend.
Mikey, Albert, can you explain to me what's going on here?
- I'm here to set up a union.
- What?
That's right.
I always put a point of honor in meeting the workers, and these gentlemen were showing me around.
I thought we'd settled this union thing last year.
I do.
I was showing him the way out.
Look, Mr. Spencer, right?
What does this company bring to you?
Although it's none of your business, I have a good set of benefits.
A good set of benefits.
See how quickly the larb learns the language of his master.
Ma'am, I'll ask you once I'm nice.
Tell your superiors we're not interested.
I'll tell my superiors.
But before that, I have a little message to pass on to your superiors.
Tell your superiors, the pig slayers, the cowardly exploiters who hide their filth behind the pretty little logo of a cute pig, while they only produce pain and destruction.
Ma'am.
Please, sir, let me finish.
Look around you.
See?
Do you hear that?
And you're standing here, in this death warehouse!
Do you have the audacity to tell me that you have a good set of benefits?
What about them?
Do they have a good set of benefits?
We all know the answer, don't we?
It's an old story like the world.
The history of every society is the history of the class struggle.
The free man and the slave, the lord and the serf, in a word, the oppressor and the oppressed, in perpetual conflict, engaged in an endless struggle.
A struggle that has always ended, either by a revolutionary restructuring of society, or by a complete failure!
Tell that to your superiors!
You think you're so fucking...
You keep talking to me about this and this, and a lot of bullshit, and I'm telling you.
This is a shitty situation.
With a capital "M"!
Have you ever...?
Doesn't that make you...?
Well?
Tell that to your superiors!
Come see me in Venice at 3:00.
Take him directly to his office and put him in the trunk.
I'll take your furniture.
Are you trying to sell me drugs?
Miss, come here. Jane.
Jane!
You're freaking me out.
Oh, my God!
Jane!
What are you doing?
I don't even know where I am.
Can I give you a ride?
Number one:
Go to the weed festival.
You smoke a lot of weed, don't you?
Not really.
So, you're a communist?
I'm not a communist.
Why do you absolutely want to go to Venice?
I need to find someone.
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
If you could, by a simple gesture, change the trajectory of your life, would you?
The trajectory of my life?
The direction your life takes, where you're going.
I don't know...
I don't think so.
I've got a good job.
I'm just thinking about changing the trajectory of my life, that's all.
That's cool.
I'm excited when I'm high.
What?
The grass makes me crazy.
Don't you like that?
I'm not high right now.
Why don't we just fuck?
Here, now, in the car.
In the middle of this traffic jam.
I don't want an accident.
Come on, Mikey, fuck me.
Fuck me right now.
Come on, Mikey.
Fuck me.
Come on!
It's not moving, is it?
Traffic...
It's boring.
That's right.
- Oh, my God!
I have to go!
- We're on the highway.
What's wrong?
I have to stop my drug dealer from stealing my bed!
What are you talking about?
I don't have time to...
Hey!
Where are you going?
Number two, convince Steve not to steal my bed.
You shouldn't be walking on the road.
It's dangerous.
- Where are you going?
Venice.
I'm going.
I'll drop you off.
Hang on.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Thank you.
You too.
She was nice.
Carrot oil!
Excuse me, are you from the festival?
I'm from Bethlehem.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm kidding.
But it's over.
What?
You're late.
It's over.
Is this Venice's 33rd annual beuh festival?
Not anymore.
Are you kidding me?
I had to join my drug dealer.
You know him?
It's Steve.
Steve?
He's not a guy with two arms, two legs, and a head?
It's Steve.
Forget it.
Have a good trip.
At this moment, perched above the Earth, above those who came so far to find it,
Jane knew what to do.
Jane was neither a conspirator nor a manipulative nor a thief.
