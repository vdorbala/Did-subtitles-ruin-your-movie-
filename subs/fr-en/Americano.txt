Passport.
Four fingers on the screen.
Welcome home.
Next.
Do you live here?
It's for you.
What's that?
Back to the sender...
We're only following the US.
I'm sorry.
Have you seen my mom?
As you may know, in the United States, children do not inherit automatically, there may be other beneficiaries.
Excuse me?
At home, in the United States, you can bequeath your property to whoever you want.
Not necessarily a parent.
We can give everything to a friend.
- I didn't know.
- There you go.
Your mother didn't leave any written instructions, but... did she have any wishes?
For relatives, friends?
So this is a very simple case of succession.
So, about the apartment, here's the deed of ownership.
Just put the name and address of the new owner and I'll make a copy for the file.
Let's go.
You have time...
Recording the act takes a week.
A week?
Yes.
I'll take care of it when you leave.
- I'll check it out.
- Be careful, without a name, it's like a blank check.
Don't worry.
Can you help me with my door?
The key doesn't turn.
Yes.
Where do you live?
On the other side, over there.
Can you help me?
Of course.
Are you still writing?
It's longer than expected.
What's this about?
It's my autobiography.
When was that?
About five years ago.
Kid, I was calling you the man at the machine.
I write because I'm bored.
What I like is the picture.
That's memories.
I'm so sorry.
Your mother was an adorable person.
I rented him my garage.
But I didn't get to know her well.
But I tried...
Do you recognize?
Neighbors' daughter, Lola.
You were on your skateboard in front of her.
Keep it.
I remember.
And what happened to them?
They moved a long time ago to El Monte, after Downtown L.A.
Lola kept in touch, as you know.
She used to visit your mother from time to time.
I didn't know.
Your mother liked him.
A lot, actually.
And what?
Did they smoke joints together?
She was taking care of her, avoiding problems.
She was a mother to her.
Well...
More coffee?
Excuse me...
Excuse me!
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for a Lola.
No Lola here.
What do you want from him?
- Just talk to him.
- No Lola here.
Wait...
She's a friend of my mother's.
I've come a long way to see her.
It's very important.
I heard she was close to my mother.
Can you ask her what she knows?
That's her in the picture.
She says:
Sorry, Lola doesn't live here anymore.
She's gone?
She's been in trouble with the police, like she's always been here.
She was undocumented.
We sent her back to Tijuana.
What did you want from him?
Nothing...
It's okay.
I'll leave you.
I didn't even know her...
Thank you for your help.
What's that?
It's Monday.
The Day of the Dead.
Would you like to try it?
No, thank you.
Lola left an address.
She'll write it to you.
I hear she works in a bar at the border.
Sweetheart, too long without news of you.
You probably found a place to stay.
What do you do with your days?
I hope nothing happened to you.
Me, it's not going too well.
Doctors have little hope.
That's right, I've been exhausted since you left.
I miss you.
If something happens to me, I want you to have the apartment.
That way you can come back and live here.
See my Martin for the garage.
It's all hers, as you know.
I kiss you hard,
Emilia.
I miss you...
If something happens to me, I want you to have the apartment.
Lisa!
How are you?
All right, Linda, thank you.
And you must be...
His son.
All right, sign here.
We'll pick you up.
My condolences.
A beautiful woman, your mother...
Beautiful skin.
She's waiting for you.
Nice car.
Mustang 1966, right?
Flash McQueen's car!
Steve McQueen?
It's not the original rims.
- You have to change them.
Wait...
I can be your guide!
There's no need for a guide.
Yes, Tijuana is dangerous.
Are you looking for a hotel?
The Nelson, very nice.
Thank you.
You want to see some chicas?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Yes, everyone wants to.
Can you tell me where it is?
Only if you give me $1.
This way, are you sure?
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
This way?
There it is.
But don't stay too long or you'll end up like him.
She's waiting for you.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl, I mean... a woman.
Of course, which one?
Angelina?
Paulina?
Carla?
Butterfly?
No, Lola.
Lola...
Wait.
Okay, amigos!
Angelina, Carletita...
Shake it, Angelina!
Well?
What do you want?
Are you from the police?
Not at all!
You know Lola?
Who's Lola?
It's special...
I don't really know her.
A friend of my mother's.
I knew her, kid.
Come on, buddy!
Enjoy!
I'm Luis.
I got what you need.
A Lemon Spell!
For you now, at the Americano, homage to beauty, goddess of sex, the only and unique
Lola!
So you wanted to see me?
That's good.
Did you like it?
Don't you talk?
Let me help you.
Are you Lola?
It's me.
It's Lola.
First time in Mexico?
I don't know...
Are you here for business or pleasure?
It's very hot!
Can I have a drink?
Listen.
Come with me.
Let's find a quiet place.
There's something I want to show you, it's a surprise...
Wait!
I'm sorry.
That's not why I'm here...
Actually, you're a friend of my mother's.
Emilia.
You know her, don't you?
Listen.
Here, don't talk about your mother.
It's just you and me.
Remind me of your little name...
We used to know each other.
When we were kids in Los Angeles.
I have a very bad memory.
We used to play together in the yard sometimes.
I had a skateboard and...
Do you have any money?
Not really.
Then it won't help me remember.
Wait!
Here.
It's not me.
It's not me anymore.
I don't live in the past.
$50.
What's that?
He wanted to see a girl outside. $50.
Can we talk a little?
- Are you gonna pay or not?
- No.
Ciao.
It's okay!
Calm down!
- I'll buy you a drink.
- I'm not thirsty.
It's my tour.
Listen.
I'm not in the mood.
You don't want to blah, do you?
I paid for it, so you're listening to me!
I'm not here to listen.
I'm working.
It's $100 a room.
Let's go.
That was really impressive.
I don't know...
I'm sorry.
It never happened to me.
She just died.
Emilia, your great friend.
Who didn't give a shit about me.
Don't talk about that here.
Excuse me...
Where is she?
She just left.
Come back tomorrow.
Excuse me?
The car!
Where the fuck is my car?
I don't know!
I didn't see anything.
I'm just a kid.
I told you, it's dangerous here.
Sorry, man.
A discount voucher for viagra?
Do you know when it opens?
In two hours.
Where are you from?
Aren't you americano?
No, French.
I'm sorry about last night.
It's okay.
Look, I need to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you or skate with you.
Understood?
Let go of me.
Let me just tell you one thing.
Go on.
It's...
My mother...
She left you something.
Let's go.
You have to pay $100.
You've got ten minutes.
We were friends...
Friends?
Just friends?
Yeah, just friends.
What did you think?
Very friends, I mean, close?
Stop!
What did she leave me?
She left you... paintings.
Paintings?
Yes, his paintings.
The paintings she painted, you know?
Yes, of course.
I see.
She didn't want to be a painter.
That's how she did it.
They have sentimental value.
She wanted you to have them.
Done.
Listen...
That's very nice of you, but you should keep them.
You're her son.
And I don't need it.
She didn't care about me.
Come on!
Tell me...
I have to go.
We stayed in L.A. Almost three years.
I don't remember anything.
I'd like more photos.
Sometimes I asked her a question and she didn't answer.
She wasn't really here.
Or she was scared...
And when my father came to take me back to France, she wouldn't keep me.
She let me go.
I don't understand why...
I don't think she liked me.
You can't say that.
Don't say that.
All mothers love their child.
You just forgot.
All mothers, believe me.
How do you know?
She was talking about me?
She was talking about you all the time.
Every day.
What did she say?
She said...
My son is my son.
It's part of me, it's inside me.
I love everything about him.
I'd forgive him for anything.
And I hope he does too.
I hope he understands.
If I can't be with him, it's not that I don't like him.
I love him so much.
I want him to grow up.
I want him to breathe.
If I can't take care of him, it's because of my life.
I don't have a choice.
That's what she said.
You have to leave me now.
I don't have any money.
I told Luis I'd pay, but I don't have anything.
Go away.
Do you have a phone?
I'm calling in France.
Everybody's looking for a girl!
That's different.
I have something for her...
I can't give an address.
Come back tonight!
I really need to see her.
I don't have much time left.
I'll pay you.
- But...
- No, no money.
Can I help you clean up?
You've got to clean up!
Please.
You again?
Can I talk to you?
You love talking, it's crazy!
How did you do it, you followed me?
You know, this is gonna end badly.
Luis is loco, bipolar.
He's capable of everything.
I'm sorry, I lied to you... about what my mother left you.
It's something very important: his apartment.
His apartment...
Great!
I like surprises, but it doesn't work right now.
I don't believe you.
Lying is wrong.
I don't trust you anymore.
I can prove it.
I've got some papers...
I mean... in my car.
I just have to find her.
A Mustang, they stole it from me.
Mustang, my eye!
Trust me, I really want to help you.
You don't need your help.
But you deserve better...
You're so beautiful.
What are you doing in this crappy club?
You should get out of here.
I gave up the idea a long time ago.
For me, anyway.
I was dreaming of going to America.
You know, when I was a kid, I was studying singing in Calexico.
Let me help you.
I can help you.
I have an American passport, come with me!
Aren't you French?
I'm both.
And we could even do...
A white wedding.
I don't believe a word.
Let's see your passport.
He's in the car.
It's all in the trunk...
I swear to God, it's true.
I really have to go.
Here, at least give me the meal.
I can't.
I couldn't get my card back without my papers.
Next.
I've got to do my passport again.
American passport?
Fill out the form and sign at the bottom.
I need to talk to Luis!
There you are, amigo.
Good news, I hope.
I'll get your money soon...
I just need to see Lola.
I lost everything.
But I'll have my passport in a week and I can...
So you lost everything?
I'm tired of you.
Let me see her...
Come here.
Look at me.
There's no more Lola for you here.
Don't come back!
The real Lola died last summer.
It's not possible...
She told me...
It's not Lola, you poor loser.
She's never seen your mother before.
You're delusional!
Got it?
I don't believe you.
Her name is Rosita.
If you come back, I'll kill you.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Lola.
I don't understand.
Shit, I can't believe it!
Don't listen!
I told you...
If you come back, I'll kill you.
Now I'm killing you.
Don't listen!
Why don't you listen?
Don't listen.
Come on...
Damn it!
I can't fucking believe it.
What happened?
It burned.
No...
With him?
He fell asleep.
He says he lost his car and Lola.
I know where his car is.
They're kids having fun...
Kids?
What?
What?
Don't you have better things to do than steal cars?
I swear, it's not me.
Aren't your parents here?
My mom doesn't care about me.
Don't say that.
You can't say that.
Come on, I'll walk you home.
You know, I thought I was a sad kid.
But actually, no.
It was my mother.
I was just part of his story.
Like all the kids...
I'm not in a story.
I'm here.
Of course.
No.
I'm here for now.
What do you mean?
I shouldn't talk about it...
My mom's saving money to get me through the other side.
In the beautiful land of opportunity!
And what do you think?
I want to stay with her.
I hate Americans.
I live here.
Hello.
