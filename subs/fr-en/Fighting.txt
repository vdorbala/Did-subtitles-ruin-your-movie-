See you later.
I'm sorry.
Where is 42nd Street?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Stop him, he stole my briefcase!
I'll take care of it, don't worry about it!
Wait, I'll help you.
Thank you.
Hey, you're blocking the way!
- How are you?
- Not very good.
By the turn, please.
We got this!
Piano man, Piano Man.
Billy Joel.
Uptown Girl.
Hey, honey.
I'm selling tickets to Piano Man.
Seats in dressing rooms.
Piano man!
The Miserables, sir.
The Miserables.
Come on.
Billy Joel, Uptown Girl.
I sell tickets to Piano Man.
Uptown Girl!
We Build This City on Rock and Roll.
You know them, come on.
Hey, Janet, how are you?
Is morale good?
Be careful today, there's police everywhere.
Anyone sell tickets to Piano Man?
iPod!
Harry Potter Books!
iPod, $20.
Uptown Girl.
We Build This City on Rock and Roll.
You...
How are you?
iPod, $20.
I like your oriental jacket.
$20 each, ma'am.
- Two for 20 bucks.
- No, you...
You gave me $20.
You owe me another 20.
Ma'am, you took two.
How are you, ma'am?
How much for this Harry Potter book?
$20.
Kids love these books.
If you have children, they'll love it.
- Get your stuff out of here.
- What?
iPod, $20!
- Take it off.
- How much is this book?
I'm just trying to make a living.
Harry Potter against hippo?
There's a mistake.
- No, it's written like that.
- Where do we put the tape?
He's not a walker, he's an iPod.
Take your stuff off, man.
Take your stuff off.
Excuse me, can I get my money back?
- I want a refund.
What are you doing?
- Let go of me!
Let go of me!
- Stop!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Calm down!
Let go of me, I said!
Don't run away, bitch!
- Be careful!
- Let go of me!
I'm sorry.
I'm not looking for trouble.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Hey, come here.
Come here.
What are you doing?
Be careful.
- Give me back my money.
- Someone should call the police.
This way, walk.
Pay your ticket!
Hello, Mr. Sou.
How are you, Mr. Sou?
Good?
Do you know Radio Music Hall?
Well, there, they tried to kill me.
I bought some stuff in the downtown.
There was a fake book.
I don't know how to make this.
I'm gonna get you some umbrellas, okay?
Can I get you some umbrellas?
Yes?
Last time, it was $100, wasn't it?
I fought and lost my money.
Here's all I have left.
Is that enough?
That's $100.
I've got $20 left.
I left my stuff there, but I won't go back.
It's a bunch of thieves.
See you later, Mr. Sou.
He's the guy from earlier, Harvey.
He's coming.
Can I help you?
I want my money back.
What money?
You know that.
Come on, I don't want to...
- Come on.
- He took it.
- No, he...
- I want him back.
- He stole you?
- He's got the same shirt.
He's Z, and as you can see, he can be a little retarded.
- Harvey.
- All right, listen.
- How much did he take from you?
- Don't give him anything.
No, I'll fix it.
How much...
Hey, that's not nice.
That's not nice.
Thank you very much.
- I should call the police.
- Do it.
Do it.
I'll wait here, if you want.
You shouldn't steal people, especially those who can find you.
Sit down, we'll talk.
I just want to talk to you.
I was talking about you earlier.
Try these breaded things, they're atrocious.
- You're going after him?
- Wait, where are you going?
You gave a whole show earlier.
It was a whole street fight.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Stop following me.
I'm not following you, I'm walking on the street.
- If you want to make money...
- You know...
Sorry, man.
We don't have any friends here.
You think sitting at a desk and licking asses is making money?
My name is Harvey Boarden.
Let me introduce myself, my name is Harvey Boarden.
Shawn MacArthur.
Nice to meet you.
Do you like to fight?
If it's necessary.
I can make you $5,000.
You're interested, aren't you?
See this shop?
How do you think such small businesses do to stay open?
A B.M.W. parked in front.
Well-dressed people.
They like people who like to fight.
Would you like to make money like that?
Yes or no?
If you don't want to, you don't have to.
You can continue your life.
I can make you $5,000 for one fight.
You can go home if you want, or you can come with me and earn $5,000.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You don't have anywhere to go.
You better give me $5,000 if I come.
Open one of your umbrellas.
- It's not raining.
- You're right.
Have you seen these guys before?
I'm their agent, sort of.
Hey, Christopher and Jack.
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hi, Claudette and Martinez.
- A Chinese man named Martinez.
Really weird.
- That guy was Chinese?
- Yeah, it's his mother, I think.
These guys run all the betting networks in the city.
And that's what counts, because that's where your pay comes from.
Hey, Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson.
Harvey, thank you for Billy Joel's tickets.
I'm glad you liked it.
You look lovely tonight, ma'am.
Did he sing my favorite song, Downtown Alexa, I think?
All right.
Hey!
What are you doing, Harvey?
No way.
- No.
- I have to go to 38th Street.
It's going to rain.
Get in the car and drive.
I have an umbrella for you.
Come on, get in.
Throw that box away, you don't need it anymore.
Where are we going?
We're riding in a $100,000 Mercedes.
That's where we're going.
Okay, what about the $5,000?
Here's your guy.
- Hello.
- Thanks for coming.
I got your message, so here I am.
- Gas drink, anything?
Please, go get me an orange soft drink.
So, what's going on?
We'll give you your chance.
You want to fight, don't you?
I want to make money.
First, you have to make yourself presentable.
- Put it on.
- I don't want your jacket.
The first impression is crucial.
Come on.
It's for making money.
I'm offering you an opportunity to do it.
Give me a nice smile.
I don't care.
- Where's my change?
- It cost $3.
I can buy this for $1 across the street.
Yeah, and you could have bought that 50 cents from the supermarket.
These actors...
- Come on.
- I don't...
- Are we gonna make some money?
I feel stupid.
If they invite you, say you know how to fight, don't you?
Don't say anything and let me talk, I'll take care of everything.
Harvey, would you like a stove?
Christopher, are you still fighting?
I got a guy for you.
Hey, Z, get him here!
- That guy's a fighter.
- All right?
Jack.
Jack.
Tell me, when was the last time you had a white guy who looked like that in one of your fights?
And you went to college, didn't you?
- You went to college?
- That's remarkable.
It's a real one.
A white guy who went to college.
- And I didn't hear about you?
- He just...
No offense, I haven't heard of you either.
I'm sorry, he may be a little split.
But he...
I'm not kidding.
I'll give him a chance.
Yeah, I'll give him a chance.
A white guy who went to college.
Thank you, Jack.
Will you give me back my jacket?
Why did you talk to him?
He asked me a question.
From now on, you let me talk, okay?
- All right.
- Please.
I'll give you a beep if he calls me.
Come on.
- Give me a beep?
- I'll call, I'll leave a message.
- Where are you going?
Do you need a friend?
We've got things to do.
We'll send you a text message.
Now, there's a bunch of shit shops, merchants, big signboards, cranes and all these...
Ma'am!
Why are you yelling like that?
We used to sell drugs in this building.
Yes, but there, men take the elevator to wash the windows...
Let them...
Let's move on.
You risk your life just by crossing the street, and there's so much demolition stuff everywhere.
Look at this...
After you.
Giovanni, do you have a refrigerator in there?
It's the last one.
Buy it and the second one is free.
Come on.
They bet on your absence.
So, all of this is true?
- Yes, that's true.
Yes, less the cost.
- Take care of those shoes.
- Less what?
Less the cost.
This is Alexander.
Ray, Alexander.
Ray, Shawn.
You beat them the other day, so they're gonna drive to the front and we're gonna sit in the back.
That's my car.
And it's a very nice car.
If your guy wants to fight, I'm on my way.
- Wait.
- Look, I don't want any trouble, so relax, okay?
Where does all this hostility come from?
Send me another message, and I'll hurt you, I swear.
He keeps sending me stupid messages.
- It's expensive for me.
- Come on, Harvey.
Why isn't the car moving?
Those little messages you send me cost me a dollar a minute.
So, I'm facing a guy, and then what?
We're going over there, and if you take it, you'll win $5,000.
- If you lose, you won't get anything.
- Will we get paid tonight?
Yeah, we'll get paid.
You keep asking for that.
It's okay, Harvey.
Are there any rules?
They don't like those who are afraid.
This is the church.
If you hit him in the balls, you win.
Sydney's up there.
- Take his eyes off him, do anything.
- Stop it, Z.
- We're in Brooklyn?
- Yeah, as you can see.
- Hey, Sydney.
- Yes, yes, yes.
You're late.
Everything needs to be cleaned by tomorrow morning, so hurry up.
All right.
Excuse me.
Go on, do your thing.
Excuse me.
- You can scratch, bite...
It smells like fart here, don't you think?
It smells like pure vodka.
Here, it's a real playground, but for the rascal.
It's full of bad people.
Fighting.
Are you ready?
Go make money.
Hey, Jack.
Harvey, did you set your watch on White Time?
- I rushed.
- Did you hurry?
Yes, as always.
Na zdorovie, brother.
- Show us what's in your stomach!
- Show us, Shawn!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Come here.
It's over, it's over.
Come on, sit down.
Don't smile at anyone.
Sit down.
Be careful.
Do you have a handkerchief in your pocket?
Does anyone have one?
Give him a handkerchief.
He can fight, can't he?
- A fountain?
- I told you he knew how to fight.
You two should come to the bar.
He'll need a jacket.
- I have to go.
- Give him your jacket.
I can't stand Brooklyn.
Tell Jack I know what I'm doing.
Yes.
We're special guests of Mr. Dancing.
Could you check for me?
I'm telling you, we're on the list.
Let Renee know I'm on the list.
Let them through.
You two.
Come on, Harvey.
Harvey!
I feel like a tramp.
No, you look great.
Cordell!
Cordell, Harvey Boarden.
We're V.I.P. We're V.I.P. Hello.
We're V.I.P.
This way.
They won't tell us anything.
Try to get involved with people.
Come have a drink.
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend?
Shawn, this is Shevonne Dubai.
Is that the right pronunciation?
- Sit down.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?
Hey!
I heard you were great in Brooklyn today.
- He's a winner, a real winner.
I wanted to greet you the other day on the street, but with Harvey, we never know who we're dealing with, you know?
Yeah, I think I saw you.
Yeah, you just went to dinner, right?
- Is that it?
- No.
If you want dinner, I'll take you somewhere you don't have to sit at the counter.
- Shawn, right?
- Yeah, that's his name.
Look, it looks like we're gonna work together.
Yes.
I've been told he's already supposed to face the colossus there.
Yeah, I was talking to him about it.
How much, Harvey?
How long have you been in high school?
Let him rest a little.
He just fought.
- Do you want water?
- Can I buy you a glass of water?
- Poor Harvey.
Let me ask you something.
Do you think you can beat the colossus there?
Do we think he can win?
Harvey, I didn't ask you.
I was asking your friend in the pretty blazer with the blonde.
May I?
- Would you excuse me?
- Yes, yes.
Harvey, you have to put an end to this as soon as possible.
Look.
Excuse me, Harry Potter.
That's not possible.
- Well!
- I knew I'd see you again.
I feel guilty about the book.
Remember me?
- You remember me, don't you?
You stole, you...
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes?
I wanted to invite you to dinner.
- No, thank you.
I thought I'd invite you to a restaurant without a counter.
That's all.
Without a counter, I like it.
- I heard that from a guy upstairs.
- You heard that.
All right.
I feel guilty about the book, and I'd like to make it up to you.
- Hey.
- You're beautiful, as always.
Thank you.
My name is Shawn.
- Zulay.
- Zulay.
- Nice name.
- Thank you.
- I believe in destiny, so...
- Not me.
- What do you think?
- If we see each other again, then it'll be fate.
- All right.
Once again.
- All right.
Goodbye.
- I'm counting on it.
- All right.
Zulay.
There's only losers here!
Someone, tell that idiot this place is full of losers.
Right, Harvey?
So, we have another fight?
Yeah, but we'll talk about it in a minute.
- I'll meet you here.
- You said $10,000, right?
$10,000, that's a hundred times $100.
Here he is.
- Shawn, this is Jerry.
- Jerry.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Jim.
There, it's Joel, and they're their escorts.
I'll meet you there, and we'll talk about this.
Shawn.
You know, we bet a lot of money on you.
Next time, maybe you'll bet the right way.
And what is it?
You know, me, I'm burning my ass with a hundred bucks.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go sit down.
I'll be there in a second.
Come on, Jerry.
Sorry, it's our place.
You're Evan Hailey, aren't you?
Yeah, and you're wearing contact lenses.
Goddamn it!
Shawn MacArthur.
I'm sorry, is that your girlfriend?
- No.
What brings you to New York?
Well, just...
Martinez.
How are you?
I know who you are, but excuse me for a second, I...
I'm kind of in shock right now.
- You two know each other?
- I know who you are!
Yeah, we know each other.
I've already fought for Shawn's father in Birmingham, Alabama.
- How's your dad?
- I'm sure he's fine.
Good night to all of you, all right?
I'm leaving.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Relax.
Sit down.
- Hey!
Don't touch me. "Don't touch." Do you know what?
Are you worried about your jacket?
I'll buy you a new one, okay?
I don't need your jacket.
- No?
- Is everything all right here?
- Harvey.
These two guys are old friends.
Evan just offered him a new jacket.
- I don't need it, I said.
- Shawn, listen...
My name is Harvey Boarden.
Harvey Boarden, go wash my car.
Someone could hurt you for something like that.
Is this someone you?
Come on, let's go.
You should get out of here, Harvey.
I don't like you very much.
Yeah, Harvey, you can go.
You neolithic moron, always saying my name.
My dad always said, "Nothing good happens after 10:00."
It must be almost two hours now.
- Right?
- Yes.
Did you know this guy?
- Yeah, he was fighting for my dad's team.
- Really?
- I'm leaving, okay?
- You need a friend now?
- What?
I'll take a walk.
All right.
- Good night, Zulay.
- Good night, Zulay.
Good night.
Zulay.
Like July?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Did I say it well?
Yes.
I decided to take care of my destiny myself.
I can see that.
I have to go.
I...
Good to see you, Shawn.
You called me Shawn.
That's cool.
Make sure she comes home safe and sound.
- All right.
- Is that okay?
- Thank you, Shawn.
- Don't say it again.
That's my name.
That's good.
Good night.
Hi, King Arthur, it's Merlin.
Hey, man.
- What are you doing here?
- I was gonna ask you the same question.
What time is it?
You fell asleep on the bench.
You looked like a drug addict.
I just sat down for a moment.
And...
Wow!
I can't believe you saw me sleeping on...
I sat down for a minute and fell asleep.
I can't believe it.
I've got room at home.
I can take you in.
- No, I'm fine.
- If you want.
No, it's not okay.
I was going to the hotel.
Yeah, at seven in the morning.
We can't even rent a room until 1:00.
You don't have to stay at the hotel.
I live just around the corner.
You can stay there before you find something else.
- All right, but I'll pay you.
- Yeah, you'll pay me back, for sure.
Come on, get your stuff.
If we've seen you sleep here, do you know what we'll think?
We won't make any more money.
- There's nothing free in this world.
- I only stayed there for a minute or two.
Harvey Boarden took you under his wing.
We'll make it right.
Wipe your feet on the carpet.
I'm gonna close the door.
So, here we go.
Freshly repainted, new lamps.
It's okay for now.
- Yes?
- Yes, yes, yes.
For now, at least.
Anyway, here's your corner.
It's an ostropedic Sealy.
I bought it new.
- Do you like Broadway?
- Yes.
I got tickets, like for Legally Blonde and Wicked.
Wicked is an excellent piece.
I don't go there often, but when I go there, that's the one I'm going to see.
Is that you?
It's me, Jack and Martinez, and...
We thought we'd become nababs, you know?
When we got here, we started selling tickets at the Garden.
So, you're not from around here either?
Are you kidding me?
I'm from a city with culture.
From Chicago, you know?
But I guess you have your story, too, don't you?
You left your briefcase here.
What's in it?
My father always said, "Be always ready for business."
Well, you have to...
So, do you have a plan?
Do you have an overall plan in relation to these fights?
I didn't come to New York to become a little crook.
I thought I'd put money aside and become a professional baseball player.
Open an IHOP, with an office and my name on the door.
An International House of Pancakes?
But I turned out to be just a little nutty crook.
Well.
I guess it's not that bad.
By definition, it means a loser-born, while you just won.
We just won.
That's what I'm saying.
Get some rest, Shawn MacArthur.
Go to sleep.
We have a big fight tomorrow.
- $10,000, right?
- Yes.
We're on Jerome, you know?
Looks like we're there.
Yeah.
Look at that tough guy.
I bet here, no one will complain that we're building new buildings.
Come on, guys, come on.
You took a long time.
The guy was waiting for you.
Shawn, are you ready to get your ass kicked?
Is this where you're taking me, Harvey?
It's for suckers.
Good morning, ladies.
I like that.
Are you all right, girls?
Yeah.
- How are you?
- She's cute.
I like it.
You look so beautiful, why do you look so angry?
It's not my fault.
I wonder why I don't come to the Bronx more often.
You know this guy, don't you?
Yeah, he's tough.
Don't get too close.
Yes, thank you for the advice.
And here comes the king.
Yes.
Look at him, everybody.
Make me rich, man.
Make me rich.
Yes, come on.
Kick his ass.
Come on.
Come on, Shawn.
All right, Shawn!
Move!
Hit him and move!
Go on!
Yeah, like that!
Get up!
Oh, my God!
Come on, Shawn.
Shawn!
Shawn!
No, no!
No, Shawn!
Shawn!
- What are you doing?
- He spilled my things!
- My ear!
What are you doing?
We don't want any trouble!
We don't want any trouble!
Come on, let's go!
We don't want any trouble!
I don't want any trouble!
I'm serious, I don't want any trouble!
Come on, open the door!
- Go on!
- My ear!
Is he nothing serious?
His ear's a little rough, but it's okay.
He didn't...
Did he say a dog did this to him?
He didn't file a report with the police?
- A dog?
- Yes, a dog.
Can you call him?
Yes.
No one's gonna get paid.
I'm going inside.
- You should put some ice on your hand.
- It was a good fight.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- All right.
- Aren't we gonna get paid?
- We won't get a penny because of those damn Bronx maniacs.
I really need money, you know.
Really.
I'll find something, okay?
All right.
- Every day, I'm late for work.
Go to work.
Last time, it wasn't done.
- Let me do it.
- All right.
Lila, are you going to be wise?
Remember what I told you.
Abuela, I know, I'm telling you, that's all.
I'm just reminding you, 'cause you have short memories, you know?
- Calm down, young lady.
Let me do it.
- Shall I go out?
- Let me do it.
- Stay calm.
Are you sure you can come home safe and sound?
You pissed me off.
I drive better than you, and you know it.
- All right.
- You know that.
Oh, my God, what a good woman!
Be good, Lila.
Oh, my God.
It's funny, we're always on top of each other.
- Are you going to work?
What are you doing here?
I've been walking around for two hours hoping to see you.
Are you stalking me?
Oh, good.
No, I just wanted to invite you to eat a bite.
- I have to go to work.
I've got 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
You're the first arrival.
I've been here a while.
So, what do you say?
- Yes?
- But I have to come back,
- 'cause I'm working. 20 minutes.
- I'll drive you back. 20 minutes.
You don't have to come.
- Twenty minutes.
- All right, let's go.
Twenty minutes.
- If my boss calls me, I'll have to leave.
Thank you.
- Let me pull your chair.
- All right.
- I'll bring you some gasified water.
- All right, thanks.
Is that okay with you?
Yeah, that's good for me.
- So, are you all right here?
- Yeah, that's good.
It's...
- Is that good?
All right.
- I wonder what I'm going to eat.
- I'm just gonna take some squid.
- All right.
- You know, I'm not very hungry.
- All right.
Aren't you hungry?
No, not really.
Thank you.
But it's okay.
So the girl in the car is your daughter?
Yes.
She looks nice.
I saw how she looked at you.
Yeah, she's nice.
What?
I'm sorry.
There's a big pink thing on the street.
- Yes.
He's the pink rabbit man.
- You think that's funny?
- Wow!
- Do you want one?
- No.
I'll get you one, wait.
No.
He's really gonna do it.
Excuse me, sir.
- Can I have a rabbit?
- Of course, friend.
- How much is it?
- $5.
$5?
Here.
Thank you, sir.
- Have a good day.
- You too.
I'm sorry.
A pink rabbit.
Thank you.
- You didn't want it, did you?
- My daughter's gonna love her.
She thinks the guy's a cosmos visitor.
- What's her name?
Lila?
That's a nice name.
He must be my boss.
I can't stay.
If I'm still late...
But you just ordered.
- I'm sorry, I'm late.
- No.
It's our date.
Don't worry, I'll take care of the bill.
- A date?
- Yes, a date.
- A date.
All right.
- Yes, go away.
- Don't be late.
- See you later.
All right.
You're always in a hurry.
I'm sorry, I know.
Here.
Thank you.
Harv.
- But what's wrong?
- What's that?
But you said you always had to be ready for business.
When I don't get hunted in the Bronx to try to enrich you, I'll be a little more alert.
It's not my fault.
Actually, they want you to fight again Friday.
Do you like it?
Yes.
How did you do that?
I told you, I have my contacts.
It wasn't easy.
How much this time?
That's what I want to talk about, but let me get dressed first.
I need to talk to you about the guy you're gonna face.
I know you're a tough guy, Shawn, but you won't beat him.
- But he's gonna...
- Come on, I can defend myself.
I know, and that's why, when he tries to choke you, you'll just lose consciousness.
What do you mean by that?
I think you know that very well.
No, I don't.
You seem to tell me to lose on purpose.
Call it what you want.
But we're gonna make money, not like in the Bronx.
That's why you're complaining, isn't it?
No, I won't lose.
I know you won't lose, you'll do what I tell you to do.
I appreciate everything you've done for me, but if I lose, it'll be because I've been defeated.
All right, let him beat you, then.
I'm serious.
Martinez came to me and said:
"If you want to work with me, it's okay." I don't know.
What?
- You and Martinez, what?
- What do you mean, what?
I want to know why you said, "Martinez..."
I didn't say I would.
But I want to know what you're gonna do.
I'm talking about a way to make money, and nobody's done it in the Bronx, right?
- You know that.
- I know that.
I get it.
Yes.
- And now you're threatening me?
- What?
You're not threatening me?
I'm collecting you on a park bench, and you're threatening me at home?
- I'm not threatening you.
- No, I know that, and do you know why?
Because you're going out of my house, Shawn.
- Wait.
I'm sorry, okay?
No.
Get out of my house.
Pick up your things and get out of here, all right?
All right.
Hello, Mrs. Florence.
This dog is possessed by the demon.
The demon.
You know, I offered you the lodging, because that was what you needed.
I wanted to give you a place to sleep, and it had nothing to do with the rest.
I get it.
Remember the picture I showed you about Martinez, Jack and me?
I didn't say I'd go with him.
I was a lot richer back then.
He broke my leg for $100.
It's crazy, isn't it?
- $100.
- I just wanted to win.
That's all I wanted.
Strange, as it is only a false step in this environment for everyone to abandon us.
At one time, many people would have given me tons of money.
Do you really think you can beat him?
They say he's fierce.
You know if you lose, you won't get anything.
If you win, you'll have...
You'll get $30,000.
All right.
All right, let's do it.
Hello.
Hey, handsome.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you?
- So, what are you doing here?
- I've been waiting for you.
He's a man, man.
Are you a man?
Oh, no!
Sit down.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Z., fold this.
Harvey, you know you have nothing to do here, right?
Come on, Shawn.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Get out of here!
Come on!
Seize him!
Come on!
Get up!
Yeah!
That's it!
Yeah!
Shawn, get up.
We won!
Yeah!
We won!
Get up!
- No more deliveries tonight.
- You!
Your guy lost!
Yeah!
It's us!
Yeah!
Did you see that?
Did you see that?
It's us!
Yeah!
Looks like Harvey's got a winner.
It's us, to the end!
- Get out of the car.
- No, no.
I'm proud of you.
You heated Bruce Lee's butt!
I congratulate you.
Get out of my car.
Come on, Harv.
Let me out.
- Come on, Harvey.
- Let's go have a drink, Harvey.
Don't you want a drink?
No.
Come on, go celebrate, have fun.
It's raining.
I'm going home to count my money.
Leave me alone.
All right, Grandpa.
Don't get in trouble.
I'm serious.
Come on, seriously.
Just a drink.
- I won't take anything.
- Thanks for the party.
- Thanks, Renee, I like her.
- Yes, sir.
Don't tell me you're still hiding your money in your stockings.
What did your father call it?
"Nigger stuff," right?
So, they're your friends now, Sam?
Is that your boyfriends?
I saw you get out of your beautiful big limousine.
Did you pass the hat to get this?
Did you do a fundraiser?
The only thing I liked at college was to see you constantly being humiliated by your stupid father.
Really?
Until the fucker you're the ass in front of everyone in the gym.
Go on!
I'm right here!
- Do something!
I'm here!
Look at me!
Like your fucking father.
Shawn, what are you doing?
I'm not your father.
We can't just go out and have fun.
- That's right.
- It's okay.
We'll see each other again.
Let's go.
This is ridiculous.
I don't need that.
I find him unbearable.
I...
The rent isn't late.
There's a guy who keeps sticking this on the doors.
But the rent isn't late.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- I hung you with the door.
So...
This is my living room.
I have to go see Lila, so sit down.
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- It's very nice.
Thank you.
Big TV.
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.
- All right.
- All right.
Hello, my name is Shawn.
I'm Zulay's friend.
She brought me back to...
Zulay.
Zulay.
What happened?
This is...
Sorry, this is...
This is Shawn.
Shawn, this is...
It doesn't matter who it is.
What matters is that you don't bring anyone back to such an hour.
- He looks like a criminal.
- I know...
You're not supposed to bring anyone back at such an hour.
- I'm sorry.
- Rather, don't do it again.
All right?
Please, no por favor.
I don't want to hear anyone at this time.
What are you doing up at this hour?
- What's that?
- My pink rabbit.
- I'm sorry.
What are you doing up?
- My grandmother thinks you're a killer.
He didn't kill anyone.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Why did you get up?
- I want to see the scary man.
I've got to make you some food, I hear.
I'll do it, but then, please, leave.
- All right?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry.
- But look at you.
Look at you.
- I'm sorry, you know what?
- Look at you!
- I need a wire.
- What a shirt!
- I'll take it back from her.
- I'll take a needle and fix it.
So he won't look like that anymore.
- You're not ashamed?
- Yes.
What kind of man would walk around like this?
Thanks for...
Come on, no.
This way.
This way, go back to bed.
- I don't want to go back to bed.
- Come on, go back to bed.
Shawn has something to tell you.
What?
I don't understand what you're saying.
Do you speak English, Spanish?
All right.
She's totally awake.
It's going well.
So... that opinion on the door...
If you...
If you need anything...
- Tell me.
- So...
Evan, the guy from the bar, do you know him?
Yes.
I know him.
- How did you know him?
- I don't know him, but...
People talked about him all night.
So, he's a pro, right?
Me and the guys I was with, we were back from...
I mean, it's nothing professional, but... if you want to know, Korea, we were back from a fight.
- It went pretty well.
- So you're a fighter.
No.
I mean, yes, but not a professional.
It's...
I don't know.
I have some sort of coaching agent.
It's going pretty well.
- What?
- I don't know.
How did you know all these guys at the bar?
I don't know them.
I don't even know your name.
What is he?
Your last name?
MacArthur.
Shawn MacArthur.
A knight's name.
I like it.
What are you thinking?
- Well?
- It's very simple.
I can fix this for you.
- I want to fix this for you.
- It's not that bad.
You want to fix it?
I want to kiss you.
Come on.
Why are you shaking?
Because I lied to you, I don't know how to sew.
You seem to be fine.
Look at that mess.
I'm shaking.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Give me your finger.
Make a wish.
I made mine.
Did you do yours?
Yes.
- Excuse me!
- I'm sorry.
I know.
Enough is enough.
Please, leave.
Yes, ma'am.
That's enough for today.
You'll see her later.
- I'm sorry.
- No need.
- Just a second, I'll say goodbye.
- No second.
Go home.
Thank you, Mrs. Valez.
I'm not Mrs. Valez, but Mrs. Guzman, okay?
- And you have to go.
- Let me say good-bye.
Oh, my God, you're giving me so much trouble today.
I'm sorry.
She could have come a little later, anyway.
- I wish I had.
- Yeah, me too.
Okay, so...
All right.
- Good night.
- Shall we see each other again?
- Yes.
- When?
Are you sleeping?
Who can sleep with all that raffit up there?
I told you we'd win, didn't I?
Did you get our money?
- You're not wasting time.
- Yes, it is.
I know we just had a fight, but do you know if we'll have another fight?
I just want to make sure we maximize our winnings.
I told you, everything I have, tickets, hats, shoes, you can sell it until the next fight, if you want.
Come on, turn around.
You want to get paid, don't you?
Go get the money, I won't steal from you.
I know that because you're gonna turn around.
After tonight, you don't trust me?
All right, I'm turning around.
I'm like this, okay?
- I turned around, go ahead.
- Thank you.
I turned around.
I was with the girl from the bar earlier.
Keep looking, and you'll be with her.
You can turn around.
She has a daughter.
And she's having rent problems, I think.
I thought I'd help him.
Stop smiling, I know what you'll say.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why don't I help him?
Except for the kid and the need for money...
Why do you have to analyze everything like this?
Your problem is, you don't trust anyone.
Here.
I'll never trust you or your briefcase.
My briefcase?
Yeah, and your briefcase doesn't trust anyone either.
There's $10,000 in there.
- Yes.
That's good, isn't it?
- I was right, wasn't I?
Look, I...
We shouldn't sell tickets and shoes anymore.
I'm telling you, we need to...
That's what we do now.
So...
The girl, she works at Marquee?
Yes, Zulay.
Zulay.
She's nice.
- Zulay.
- Yes.
All right.
Get some rest, all right?
- There's $10,000 in there.
Get some rest, all right?
Do you know where Zulay is?
What do you want us to talk about?
Don't you have something to tell me?
What are you talking about, Harvey?
You want me to say it for you?
Why didn't you tell me you were sleeping with him?
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't have to tell you everything I do.
And now you want him to pay your bills?
- I didn't ask him that.
- You want to laugh?
You introduce him to your daughter, so you like him that much?
- You think he's better than me?
- No.
It's...
You think you're better than me and you put a lot of crap in her head.
Like riding at sunset like you're in a movie?
- Come here, I'm talking to you.
- Don't touch me.
- I'm talking to you.
- Don't touch me.
Stop.
If he decides to leave tomorrow, do you think you'll be part of his plans?
Do you think your daughter will be a part of it?
- Maybe.
- What about your grandmother?
You're so paranoid.
Yes, that's what I am: paranoid.
I'm paranoid.
You still believe in fairy tales.
But you think I'm paranoid.
Does he know how we met?
You sleeping in the back seat of your car, and your daughter in the front seat?
Am I paranoid right now?
All right.
You think what you've got between your legs is gonna fix it, right?
That's what you think.
But you're wrong.
Use this on him.
Don't put any more bullshit in his head.
Look at this, guys.
- Look at what, your disgusting slum?
There's barbed wire here, man.
When was the last time?
Shut up, or I'll kick you out.
Evan Hailey passes the K.O. to Richards.
That guy's ridiculous.
No, look.
A guy like him, you have to take him seriously.
Look at his punches.
He seems to hit like a girl, but it hurts.
- He's your guy, Shawn.
- Who?
He's the guy from the bar.
No, he's a real pro.
No offense, Shawn, he's fighting in real rooms for real money.
Our friend Shawn is just hanging out with us.
Look at you, Harvey.
You've been doing this for a long time.
They say "bipolar" or "maniac-depressive".
What?
What?
Oh, my God.
Harvey, come in.
Sit down.
Come in.
We were just talking about you.
Come in.
It's a special occasion.
- Nice full.
- The jacket, at least.
- He's beautiful.
- You look great.
Not bad, Harvey.
I didn't come here to take your time.
I just came to tell you that if you're interested in Shawn...
Look at little Harvey, he looks like a child.
He's very nervous, as if he had a secret to tell us.
What's that secret, Harvey?
I'm just saying if you...
If you have anything for us, we're in.
He's the best in town, and if you have anything to offer, we're listening.
Wow!
It must be hard to come here and flatten yourself in front of all of us.
Especially in front of Martinez.
You know, Jack, I don't have to stay here and be mocked.
Guess what, Harvey?
We were talking about you and we thought maybe we should organize a fight with your guy.
A big fight. $100,000 to the winner, Harvey.
Harvey's all excited, isn't he, Harvey?
Are you excited, Harvey?
$100,000.
Evan Hailey will show him all the colors.
Time out.
He couldn't hold back.
Here's the fight we want to organize:
Evan Hailey versus Shawn MacArthur.
And we're gonna make him moss about the fact that they went to the same school, you know, about their education rivalry.
Of their rivalry for their education.
- All right.
- I know.
As soon as we announce this, the phone won't leak.
We're giving you news.
Harvey, are you sure you're ready for this, Harvey?
You always have to say my name, don't you?
I don't know, Harvey, maybe I'm stupid.
But not enough to believe Shawn will win.
- This is stupid, Harvey.
Really.
You don't know how good he is.
Yeah, I know that.
That's why I have Evan on my side.
The loser will have nothing at all.
And neither do you, as always.
Hello.
Let's go for a walk and talk a little.
All right.
So, are you gonna tell me what's going on?
I found you another fight.
All right?
How much?
$100,000.
- What?
- Yes.
They want you to face Evan Hailey.
He's your opponent.
Great.
I'll take all my money and bet against us.
You don't have any money.
Do you know how much I can borrow for such a fight?
Then borrow it and put everything on us.
- People like to have guarantees.
- Then guarantee our victory.
Jerry, the guys from Wall Street and even Martinez will get on board for that.
- We're talking about a lot of money.
- You're talking about money.
Come on, Shawn.
You think there's a trophy to win?
Everybody don't care about that.
And if we lose, we'll have nothing.
You understand, don't you?
What?
Come on, Shawn.
Listen, do you think I don't know I'm worth anything?
I'm not worth anything, I get it.
I suck.
Nobody said that.
Come on.
All I'm saying is I don't want to lose.
- I'm telling you, Shawn...
- I know you think that's stupid.
It is.
But I don't want to do it and I won't.
Understood?
- Stop and listen to me.
- I'm serious.
Listen.
I'm talking to you.
- Harvey.
- What, are you gonna hit me?
- No, I...
I'm sorry.
- You think I'm your father?
Are you gonna beat me up like I'm your father?
All right, I get it.
You think I don't know who you are, Shawn.
- What?
- But I know everything about you.
So don't talk to me about morality, Shawn.
It's not working with me.
Harvey, don't ever tell me about my father.
Are you gonna hit me?
Don't ever tell me about my father.
- Hey.
- You're back.
You know me, I'm stalking you.
You surprised me taking my shower.
So, what are you doing here?
Nothing, I was just...
I don't know, I wanted to see you.
Come in.
My grandmother keeps Lila.
I know, it's hot in here, if you want to sit down, I'll be right back.
Hey, listen.
I made money and I want to help you, about the opinion that was on your door.
It's really...
No...
That's nice, but...
- For Lila.
- No, I don't need it.
Look, wait.
Just for Lila.
Wait.
Please, listen to me.
I don't know what I'm trying to say.
I don't want to offend you.
You came here to give me money.
Don't...
It doesn't matter, okay?
I don't know how... 2 missed calls HARVEY 3:45 - HARVEY 3:44
What?
- Your hair smells good.
- Thank you.
You know, washing your hair in the sink, it's called a Puerto Rican shower.
My grandfather hated people calling it that.
Of course, he could say it.
I like it, I like it.
I know what happened with your father.
Don't you mind?
I read...
Lila and I were on the computer, and we ran into...
- Wow!
- I'm so sorry.
No.
Are you checking who I am?
No problem.
- You okay?
- Yes.
So, do you think I'm a madman?
No.
I mean, you'd be right.
I really did.
I lost my mind, so...
Remember Evan the other night at the bar after all this?
Yes.
We were on the same team, and my father was our coach.
He loved Evan.
It was my first year there, and I was constantly being mocked.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I lost my temper.
Evan and I fought, and my father intervened, without me seeing him.
And I...
I hit him.
I hit my father.
And I didn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
My father never forgave me, and he's right.
I'll take it.
Well, I have to go, I have something to do at the bar.
I have to go do something at the bar that I completely forgot about.
- All right.
- Hurry up.
- I'll come with you.
I'll hurry.
- We're leaving.
I heard you the first time.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
I forgot I had to go do that.
- You okay?
- Yeah, why?
Just a question.
- You okay?
- Yes.
Hey, Harvey.
What?
What's going on?
I was going to tell you, I know Harvey.
Wait a minute.
Do you know each other?
Yeah, I know her.
I know her.
- Listen...
- How do you...
How do you know each other?
What's going on, are you two together?
- No.
- Look, Shawn...
- No.
I'm talking to her.
- I'm talking...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
It's up to her to answer me.
Let me put a note.
What did I just say?
What's going on?
- Shawn...
- I'm talking to her.
- I'm talking to you.
- I want to talk to him!
- Let go of me!
- Shut up!
- Let go of me!
- Stop it!
That's not what you think.
You're not the only one working with me.
So does she.
That's what I was explaining at the apartment.
Nobody knows we know each other.
She's betting for me.
- Here's our connection.
- I was gonna tell you, Shawn.
You told me about...
You told me about my father.
- Shawn...
- Why did you do that?
You should learn to answer the phone.
All you had to do was answer.
- Why did you come?
- You should have sent me a message!
Harvey and I have been friends a long time.
Listen to me.
I should have told you, I know.
- I don't know what I can tell you.
Listen to me, okay?
I'm earning $11 an hour, okay?
Is that what you want to know?
I make $11 an hour, I'm broke.
All night, I pick up the glasses of people I hate and I really shouldn't do that.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because.
Harvey, he's just my friend.
He's giving me money, and I'm gonna bet in his place.
Nobody knows we know each other.
Then why didn't you tell me?
Is this fight still working?
- Listen...
- Yeah, I get it.
Lose on purpose.
No one will know.
And you're gonna tell me you're okay with that?
Yes.
But I want half your winnings.
Really, I have nothing, you know.
No, forget it.
All right.
- That's how it is, isn't it?
That's how it is.
All right.
You know that there, every look will be on you.
If there's any clue that you're on purpose to lose, we'll both die.
You understand how much money they...
They don't scare me, Harvey.
This town doesn't scare me.
I'll do whatever you want.
And you'll never see me again.
None of you.
It's not about tickets, Harvey.
You're aware there's $250,000 in that bag.
Harvey, make sure we don't have to look for you.
Nice office, Harvey.
- I'm glad you could come.
- You should hire a receptionist.
Will he listen to you, Harvey?
If you don't believe me, he's right here, then you can ask him.
I'm asking you, Harvey.
There's $250,000 in there.
If he decides he doesn't like to lose and by miracle, he wins, I'll still want my money, Harvey.
If I don't have my money, Harvey, I'll kill you.
That's a lot of money.
Come in.
Zulay, have you had another dream?
- That's a lot of money, Jack.
How much are we talking about?
Half a million dollars.
What are you doing walking on the street with half a million dollars in your bag?
- I have investors.
- Investors.
- If it's too much money, I can...
- Too much money?
Listen to this.
She cleans containers, and here she is in high society.
Tell your rich and stupid friends I'll be happy to pay them.
And even happier not to do it.
Count.
The guy's here.
Out.
Everyone needs to get out on the terrace so we can start.
Show's about to start.
Out.
- Nice place.
- Of course.
I've got town hall, the Woolworth Building...
My meditation room.
Come out, everybody.
I'll meet you outside.
Let me talk to you for a second.
You know what we're risking, right?
Let's go.
Let's get this over with.
Look, Harvey.
See how far you got?
Hey, everybody.
Jerry invited us all here to get an idea of his bank account.
That's nice, isn't it?
Jerry's.
But the important thing...
If we're here today, it's for this.
Jerry, please give them the place.
Gentlemen, it's up to you.
Go on, go on!
Sit down, everybody.
These two men will fight, and it will be eye for eye, tooth for tooth.
No matter what happens, no problem.
No matter what you do to yourself, no problem.
No matter what you say, no problem.
As the great and late American poet said
Mr. Marvin Gaye,
"Let the fight begin!"
Yeah, go on!
Yeah!
Did you freeze?
You want to intimidate me.
You're giving me the big eyes.
Did you do the same to your father?
Make him lose his smile, come on!
Yeah, go on!
All right.
Let's go.
Let's go, Shawn.
Show him what's in your stomach!
Go on!
- Come on, Shawn!
- Kick his ass!
Hit him, Shawn!
Hit him!
Hit him!
This is Shawn.
He's fucking with him!
You can't stay here, Shawn!
Oh, shit!
Hey, that's enough!
That's enough!
That's enough!
That's enough!
That's enough!
Stop the fight!
That's enough!
That's enough!
Come on, Shawn!
Get up!
Get up, man!
Get up, get up!
Get up, get up!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Come on, Shawn!
You have to fight!
Come on!
Get out of here!
Fight!
Come on, Shawn!
Yeah!
No!
No!
Harvey, what's going on, Harvey?
No!
Come on!
Yeah!
Goddamn it!
No!
Bravo, boy!
- Well done, Shawn!
- Well done, Shawn!
You won, Shawn.
Let's go, guys.
- Yeah!
- Who's the best?
Harvey, I'd like to shake your hand.
You're a dead man.
You're a dead man, Harvey.
A dead man.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Who's the best?
Yeah!
After all this, I need a drink.
Thanks, Evan, you're fighting like a wimp.
Harvey, we're going out.
Oh, there he is.
You're the best, man.
Yeah, you were fantastic last night.
Thank you very much.
- Thanks for the show.
- Thanks for coming.
We're going out to the bar tonight.
Are you coming?
- V.I.P., free drinks.
- Come on.
Come on.
- No, I'm exhausted.
- V.I.P., Harvey.
V.I.P.
V.I.P. Be careful.
Tonight, you have to celebrate.
I'm telling you, secretly, I was hoping you'd win.
It's crazy, isn't it?
If I wasn't a dead man, I'd be happy.
But you just killed me, Shawn.
You do what you have to do, you know.
Look, in a few minutes, some men will come, and you don't have to be here when they get there, okay?
Zulay and I were betting on our victory.
Yes.
We knew you'd never do it, so we didn't tell you, but...
There's a million dollars in there.
You always have to be ready for business, right?
- We have to be.
- You taught me that.
All right.
There's a lot of money in there.
I'm not kidding, Shawn.
That's a lot of money.
That's a lot of IHOP.
We're going to Birmingham.
All right.
We're going to visit my family.
At least what's left of it.
You know what I mean?
Maybe we'll make a stop in Chicago.
Chicago, on the way to Birmingham.
That's right.
Come with us.
So, you want to go to Birmingham?
Yes.
I'm from here.
What we should do, so...
Let me talk.
We should go through Birmingham and get to a hot spot.
As long as you go to Chicago or Birmingham, whatever, go to California.
Anything's possible there.
I've read a lot, and I'm not gonna pay those people back.
I won't give them...
Unless...
We shouldn't give anything to anyone.
We should just leave.
"Love," said Grandma,
"I believe in it, and I will go to Africa, because my lover is there.
"Then I'll change my mind, maybe.
For love is wonderful."
- Oh, my God.
- It's fantastic, Alabama.
The Alabama.
The Alabama.
All the time, Alabama, Alabama.
- Shut up, will you?
- You're making me lose my mind.
You're scaring my ears.
